   * **_Commonwealth agreement_** means a legally binding agreement between an agency (on behalf of the Commonwealth) and a notforprofit entity.

   * **_confidential information_** means information, the disclosure of which:

    * (a) would found an action for breach of confidence; or

    * (b) would disclose:

     * (i) trade secrets; or

     * (ii) any other information having a commercial value that would be, or could reasonably be expected to be, destroyed or diminished if the information were disclosed; or

    * (c) would be a disclosure of information likely to prejudice national security (within the meaning of subsection 17(1) of the _National Security Information (Criminal and Civil Proceedings) Act 2004_).

   * **_notforprofit entity _**means:

    * (a) an entity that is entitled to be registered under the _Australian Charities and Notforprofits Commission Act 2012_; or

   * **_prohibited content_** has the meaning given by section 5.

##### 4  Agency not to include prohibited content in Commonwealth agreement

   * (1) An agency must not include prohibited content in a Commonwealth agreement.

   * (2) If, apart from this subsection, a Commonwealth agreement includes prohibited content, that prohibited content is void.

##### 5  Prohibited content

   * (1) **_Prohibited content_** is any requirement that restricts or prevents a notfor profit entity (including staff of the notforprofit entity) from commenting on, advocating support for or opposing a change to any matter established by law, policy or practice of the Commonwealth.

   * (2) However, the requirement is not **_prohibited content_** to the extent that it restricts or prevents a notfor profit entity from disclosing information that:

    * (a) is confidential information; or

    * (b) is personal information (within the meaning of the _Privacy Act 1988_).

##### 6  Compensation for acquisition of property

   * (1) If the operation of this Act would result in an acquisition of property from a person otherwise than on just terms, the Commonwealth is liable to pay a reasonable amount of compensation to the person.

   * (2) If the Commonwealth and the person do not agree on the amount of the compensation, the person may institute proceedings in the Federal Court of Australia for the recovery from the Commonwealth of such reasonable amount of compensation as the Court determines.

   * (3) In this section:

   * **_acquisition of property_** has the same meaning as in paragraph 51(xxxi) of the Constitution.

   * **_just terms_** has the same meaning as in paragraph 51(xxxi) of the Constitution.

##### 7  Application

   * (2) Despite subsection (1), subsection 4(1) applies to a Commonwealth agreement entered into on or after the commencement of this Act.

    * (b) paragraph (a) does not affect any right, privilege, obligation or liability acquired, accrued or incurred under the prohibited content before the commencement of this Act.
