#### Division 3A--Price reductions

##### Subdivision A--Preliminary

##### 99AC  What this Division is about

    * This Division is about price reductions for listed brands of pharmaceutical items.

    * Subdivision B requires there to be at least a 16% price reduction in the price of a new brand of a pharmaceutical item (other than a combination item) when it lists. The listing of the new brand of the pharmaceutical item also provides a trigger for price reductions to occur under Subdivision D (see section 99ACH) for:

     * (a) other existing brands of the pharmaceutical item; and

     * (b) existing brands of pharmaceutical items that have the same drug and manner of administration; and

     * (c) existing brands of pharmaceutical items that have a drug in the same therapeutic group and the same manner of administration.

    * Subdivision C sets out the circumstances in which price reductions are required for combination items.

    * Subdivision CA sets out the circumstances in which price reductions are required for new brands of pharmaceutical items that have the same drug as an existing brand of a pharmaceutical item that is subject to an outstanding staged reduction under section 99ACK. The listing of the new brand or brands also provides a trigger for price reductions to occur under Subdivision D (see sections 99ACM and 99ACN) for existing brands of pharmaceutical items that have that drug.

    * Subdivision D provides for other price reductions for pharmaceutical items (including for combination items in some cases). These price reductions:

     * (a) are triggered when Subdivision B applies to require a 16% price reduction to a new brand of a pharmaceutical item; or

     * (b) are triggered when Subdivision CA applies to a new brand of a pharmaceutical item that has the same drug as an existing brand of a pharmaceutical item that is subject to an outstanding staged reduction; or

     * (c) arise if the pharmaceutical item has a drug on F2 on a particular day.
