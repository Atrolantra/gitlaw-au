    * (b) the Council will not interfere with the proper performance of the functions of industrial tribunals; and

    * (c) subject to the rights of persons participating in meetings of the Council to report to the persons, bodies and organisations by which they are nominated and to the right of the Council to make announcements that those persons agree are in the public interest, the views expressed at those meetings will be kept confidential.

##### 6  Membership of Council

    * (a) has changed its name; or

    * (b) has merged with another organisation; or

    * (c) has been succeeded by another organisation;

   * the Governor-General may make regulations amending that paragraph of subsection (1) so that the paragraph refers to the organisation under its new name, to the merged organisation, or to the successor organisation, as the case requires.
