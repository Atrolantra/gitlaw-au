### An Act to establish the Natural Heritage Trust of  Account, and for related purposes

#### Preamble

    * The Parliament of Australia recognises the need for urgent action to redress the current decline, and to prevent further decline, in the quality of 's natural environment.

    * There is a national crisis in land and water degradation and in the loss of biodiversity.

    * There is a need to conserve 's environmental infrastructure, to reverse the decline in 's natural environment and to improve the management of 's natural resources.

    * There is a need for the Commonwealth to provide national leadership and work in partnership with all levels of government and the whole community, recognising, among other things, that many environmental issues and problems are not limited by State and Territory borders.

    * There is a need to integrate the objectives of environmental protection, sustainable agriculture and natural resources management consistent with the principles of ecologically sustainable development.

    * It is essential that government leadership be demonstrated, and that the Australian community be involved, in relation to these matters.

    * The Commonwealth Government should work cooperatively with State governments to achieve effective outcomes in matters relating to environmental protection, natural resources management and sustainable agriculture. Those cooperative working relationships should involve entering into intergovernmental agreements which reflect the support of the States for the purposes of the Natural Heritage Trust of Australia Account and promote the development of complementary policies and programs.

    * 's rural community should have a key role in the ecologically sustainable management of 's natural resources.

    * 's natural environment is central to 's and Australians' health and nonmaterial wellbeing and to 's present and future economic prosperity. Accordingly, present and future generations of Australians will benefit from the ecologically sustainable management of the natural environment.

    * A comprehensive, integrated response to these matters is necessary. 

    * The above considerations are taken into account by the Parliament of Australia in enacting the law that follows.
