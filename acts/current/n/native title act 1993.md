### An Act about native title in relation to land or waters, and for related purposes

#### Preamble

     * This preamble sets out considerations taken into account by the Parliament of Australia in enacting the law that follows. 

     * The people whose descendants are now known as Aboriginal peoples and Torres Strait Islanders were the inhabitants of  before European settlement. 

     * They have been progressively dispossessed of their lands. This dispossession occurred largely without compensation, and successive governments have failed to reach a lasting and equitable agreement with Aboriginal peoples and Torres Strait Islanders concerning the use of their lands. 

     * As a consequence, Aboriginal peoples and Torres Strait Islanders have become, as a group, the most disadvantaged in Australian society. 

     * The people of  voted overwhelmingly to amend the Constitution so that the Parliament of Australia would be able to make special laws for peoples of the aboriginal race. 

     * The Australian Government has acted to protect the rights of all of its citizens, and in particular its indigenous peoples, by recognising international standards for the protection of universal human rights and fundamental freedoms through:

   * (a) the ratification of the International Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Racial Discrimination and other standardsetting instruments such as the International Covenants on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights and on Civil and Political Rights; and

   * (b) the acceptance of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights; and

   * (c) the enactment of legislation such as the _Racial Discrimination Act 1975 _and the _Australian Human Rights Commission Act 1986_.

     * The High Court has: 

   * (a) rejected the doctrine that  was _terra nullius _(land belonging to noone) at the time of European settlement; and

   * (b) held that the common law of Australia recognises a form of native title that reflects the entitlement of the indigenous inhabitants of Australia, in accordance with their laws and customs, to their traditional lands; and

   * (c) held that native title is extinguished by valid government acts that are inconsistent with the continued existence of native title rights and interests, such as the grant of freehold or leasehold estates.

     * The people of  intend: 

   * (a) to rectify the consequences of past injustices by the special measures contained in this Act, announced at the time of introduction of this Act into the Parliament, or agreed on by the Parliament from time to time, for securing the adequate advancement and protection of Aboriginal peoples and Torres Strait Islanders; and

   * (b) to ensure that Aboriginal peoples and Torres Strait Islanders receive the full recognition and status within the Australian nation to which history, their prior rights and interests, and their rich and diverse culture, fully entitle them to aspire. 

     * The needs of the broader Australian community require certainty and the enforceability of acts potentially made invalid because of the existence of native title. It is important to provide for the validation of those acts.

     * Justice requires that, if acts that extinguish native title are to be validated or to be allowed, compensation on just terms, and with a special right to negotiate its form, must be provided to the holders of the native title. However, where appropriate, the native title should not be extinguished but revive after a validated act ceases to have effect. 

     * It is particularly important to ensure that native title holders are now able to enjoy fully their rights and interests. Their rights and interests under the common law of  need to be significantly supplemented. In future, acts that affect native title should only be able to be validly done if, typically, they can also be done to freehold land and if, whenever appropriate, every reasonable effort has been made to secure the agreement of the native title holders through a special right to negotiate. It is also important that the broader Australian community be provided with certainty that such acts may be validly done. 

     * A special procedure needs to be available for the just and proper ascertainment of native title rights and interests which will ensure that, if possible, this is done by conciliation and, if not, in a manner that has due regard to their unique character. 

     * Governments should, where appropriate, facilitate negotiation on a regional basis between the parties concerned in relation to:

   * (a) claims to land, or aspirations in relation to land, by Aboriginal peoples and Torres Strait Islanders; and

   * (b) proposals for the use of such land for economic purposes.

     * It is important that appropriate bodies be recognised and funded to represent Aboriginal peoples and Torres Strait Islanders and to assist them to pursue their claims to native title or compensation. 

     * It is also important to recognise that many Aboriginal peoples and Torres Strait Islanders, because they have been dispossessed of their traditional lands, will be unable to assert native title rights and interests and that a special fund needs to be established to assist them to acquire land. 

     * The Parliament of Australia intends that the following law will take effect according to its terms and be a special law for the descendants of the original inhabitants of .  

     * The law, together with initiatives announced at the time of its introduction and others agreed on by the Parliament from time to time, is intended, for the purposes of paragraph 4 of Article 1 of the International Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Racial Discrimination and the _Racial Discrimination Act 1975_, to be a special measure for the advancement and protection of Aboriginal peoples and Torres Strait Islanders, and is intended to further advance the process of reconciliation among all Australians. 

     * The Parliament of Australia therefore enacts: 

### Part 1--Preliminary

##### 1  Short title

     * This Act may be cited as the _Native Title Act 1993_.

##### 2  Commencement

     * Commencement of provisions on Royal Assent

     * (1) Sections 1 and 2 commence on the day on which this Act receives the Royal Assent.

     * Commencement of provisions by Proclamation

     * (2) Subject to subsection (3), the remaining provisions of this Act commence on a day or days to be fixed by Proclamation.

     * Forced commencement of provisions

     * (3) If a provision referred to in subsection (2) does not commence under that subsection within the period of 9 months beginning on the day on which this Act receives the Royal Assent, it commences on the first day after the end of that period.

##### 3  Objects

     * Main objects

     * The main objects of this Act are: 

      * (a) to provide for the recognition and protection of native title; and

      * (b) to establish ways in which future dealings affecting native title may proceed and to set standards for those dealings; and

      * (c) to establish a mechanism for determining claims to native title; and

      * (d) to provide for, or permit, the validation of past acts, and intermediate period acts, invalidated because of the existence of native title.

##### 4  Overview of Act

     * Recognition and protection of native title

     * (1) This Act recognises and protects native title. It provides that native title cannot be extinguished contrary to the Act.

     * Topics covered

     * (2) Essentially, this Act covers the following topics:

      * (a) acts affecting native title (see subsections (3) to (6));

      * (b) determining whether native title exists and compensation for acts affecting native title (see subsection (7)).

     * Kinds of acts affecting native title

     * (3) There are basically 2 kinds of acts affecting native title:

      * (a) **_past acts_** (mainly acts done before this Act's commencement on 1 January 1994 that were invalid because of native title); and

      * (b) **_future acts_** (mainly acts done after this Act's commencement that either validly affect native title or are invalid because of native title).

     * Consequences of past acts and future acts

     * (4) For past acts and future acts, this Act deals with the following matters:

      * (a) their validity;

      * (b) their effect on native title;

      * (c) compensation for the acts.

     * Intermediate period acts

     * (5) However, for certain acts (called **_intermediate period acts_**) done mainly before the judgment of the High Court in _Wik Peoples v Queensland _(1996) 187 CLR 1, that would be invalid because they fail to pass any of the future act tests in Division 3 of Part 2, or for any other reason because of native title, this Act provides for similar consequences to past acts.

     * Confirmation of extinguishment of native title

     * (6) This Act also confirms that many acts done before the High Court's judgment, that were either valid, or have been validated under the past act or intermediate period act provisions, will have extinguished native title. If the acts are **_previous exclusive possession acts_** (see section 23B), the extinguishment is complete; if the acts are **_previous nonexclusive possession acts_** (see section 23F), the extinguishment is to the extent of any inconsistency.

     * Role of Federal Court and National Native Title Tribunal

     * (7) This Act also:

      * (a) provides for the Federal Court to make determinations of native title and compensation; and

      * (aa) provides for the Federal Court to refer native title and compensation applications for mediation; and

      * (ab) provides for the Federal Court to make orders to give effect to terms of agreements reached by parties to proceedings including terms that involve matters other than native title; and

      * (b) establishes a National Native Title Tribunal with power to:

       * (i) make determinations about whether certain future acts can be done and whether certain agreements concerning native title are to be covered by the Act; and

       * (ii) provide assistance or undertake mediation in other matters relating to native title; and

      * (c) deals with other matters such as the keeping of registers and the role of representative Aboriginal/Torres Strait Islander bodies.

##### 5  Act binds Crown

     * This Act binds the Crown in right of the Commonwealth, of each of the States, of the , of the  and of . However, nothing in this Act renders the Crown liable to be prosecuted for an offence.

##### 6  Application to external Territories, coastal sea and other waters

     * This Act extends to each external Territory, to the coastal sea of  and of each external Territory, and to any waters over which  asserts sovereign rights under the _Seas and Submerged Lands Act 1973_.

##### 7  Racial Discrimination Act

     * (1) This Act is intended to be read and construed subject to the provisions of the _Racial Discrimination Act 1975_.

     * (2) Subsection (1) means only that:

      * (a) the provisions of the _Racial Discrimination Act 1975_ apply to the performance of functions and the exercise of powers conferred by or authorised by this Act; and

      * (b) to construe this Act, and thereby to determine its operation, ambiguous terms should be construed consistently with the _Racial Discrimination Act 1975_ if that construction would remove the ambiguity.

     * (3) Subsections (1) and (2) do not affect the validation of past acts or intermediate period acts in accordance with this Act.

##### 8  Effect of this Act on State or Territory laws

     * This Act is not intended to affect the operation of any law of a State or a Territory that is capable of operating concurrently with this Act.

##### 8A  Application of the Criminal Code

     * (1) Subject to subsection (2), Chapter 2 of the _Criminal Code_ applies to all offences against this Act.

         * Note: Chapter 2 of the _Criminal Code_ sets out the general principles of criminal responsibility.

     * (2) Part 2.5 of the _Criminal Code_ does not apply to an offence against Part 11 of this Act.

##### 9  Definitions located in Part 15

     * Part 15 contains definitions of certain expressions that are used in this Act.

### Part 2--Native Title

#### Division 1--Recognition and protection of native title

##### 10  Recognition and protection of native title

     * Native title is recognised, and protected, in accordance with this Act.

##### 11  Extinguishment of native title

     * (1) Native title is not able to be extinguished contrary to this Act.

     * Effect of subsection (1)

     * (2) An act that consists of the making, amendment or repeal of legislation on or after 1 July 1993 by the Commonwealth, a State or a Territory is only able to extinguish native title:

      * (a) in accordance with Division 2B (which deals with confirmation of past extinguishment of native title) or Division 3 (which deals with future acts etc. and native title) of Part 2; or

      * (b) by validating past acts, or intermediate period acts, in relation to the native title.

##### 13  Approved determinations of native title 

     * Applications to Federal Court

     * (1) An application may be made to the Federal Court under Part 3:

      * (a) for a determination of native title in relation to an area for which there is no approved determination of native title; or

      * (b) to revoke or vary an approved determination of native title on the grounds set out in subsection (5).

     * Native title determinations by Federal Court when determining compensation entitlements

     * (2) If:

      * (a) the Federal Court is making a determination of compensation in accordance with Division 5; and

      * (b) an approved determination of native title has not previously been made in relation to the whole or part of the area concerned;

     * the Federal Court must also make a current determination of native title in relation to the whole or the part of the area, that is to say, a determination of native title as at the time at which the determination of compensation is being made.

         * Note: In these circumstances, the compensation application must be accompanied by the affidavit, and contain the information, that would be required for a native title determination application for the area: see subsection 62(3).

     * Approved determinations of native title

     * (3) Subject to subsection (4), each of the following is an **_approved determination of native title_**:

      * (a) a determination of native title made on an application under paragraph (1)(a) or in accordance with subsection (2);

      * (b) an order, judgment or other decision of a recognised State/Territory body that involves a determination of native title in relation to an area within the jurisdictional limits of the State or Territory.

     * Variation or revocation of determinations

     * (4) If an approved determination of native title is varied or revoked on the grounds set out in subsection (5) by:

      * (a) the Federal Court, in determining an application under Part 3; or

      * (b) a recognised State/Territory body in an order, judgment or other decision;

     * then: 

      * (c) in the case of a variation--the determination as varied becomes an **_approved determination of native title_** in place of the original; and

      * (d) in the case of a revocation--the determination is no longer an approved determination of native title.

     * Grounds for variation or revocation

     * (5) For the purposes of subsection (4), the grounds for variation or revocation of an approved determination of native title are:

      * (a) that events have taken place since the determination was made that have caused the determination no longer to be correct; or

      * (b) that the interests of justice require the variation or revocation of the determination.

     * Review or appeal

     * (6) If:

      * (a) a determination of the Federal Court; or

      * (b) an order, judgment or other decision of a recognised State/Territory body;

     * is subject to any review or appeal, this section refers to the determination, order, judgment or decision as affected by the review or appeal, when finally determined.

     * High Court determinations

     * (7) A determination of native title by the High Court is an **_approved determination of native title_**.

#### Division 2--Validation of past acts

##### Subdivision AA--Overview of Division

##### 13A  Overview of Division

     * (1) In summary, this Division validates, or allows States and Territories to validate, certain acts that:

      * (a) took place before 1 January 1994; and

      * (b) would otherwise be invalid because of native title.

     * This Division also covers certain acts done after that day consisting of an extension or renewal etc. of an act done before that day.

     * (2) The acts validated are called **_past acts_**; they are defined in section 228.

     * (3) This Division also sets out the effect of such validation on native title. The effect varies depending on the nature of the act. For this purpose, different categories of past act are defined by sections 229 to 232.

##### Subdivision A--Acts attributable to the Commonwealth

##### 14  Validation of Commonwealth acts

     * (1) If a past act is an act attributable to the Commonwealth, the act is valid, and is taken always to have been valid.

     * Effect of validation of law

     * (2) To avoid any doubt, if a past act validated by subsection (1) is the making, amendment or repeal of legislation, subsection (1) does not validate:

      * (a) the grant or issue of any lease, licence, permit or authority; or

      * (b) the creation of any interest in relation to land or waters;

     * under any legislation concerned, unless the grant, issue or creation is itself a past act attributable to the Commonwealth.

##### 15  Effect of validation on native title

     * (1) If a past act is an act attributable to the Commonwealth:

      * (a) if it is a category A past act other than one to which subsection 229(4) (which deals with public works) applies--the act extinguishes the native title concerned; and

      * (b) if it is a category A past act to which subsection 229(4) applies:

       * (i) in any case--the act extinguishes the native title in relation to the land or waters on which the public work concerned (on completion of its construction or establishment) was or is situated; and 

       * (ii) if paragraph 229(4)(a) applies--the extinguishment is taken to have happened on 1 January 1994; and

      * (c) if it is a category B past act that is wholly or partly inconsistent with the continued existence, enjoyment or exercise of the native title rights and interests concerned--the act extinguishes the native title to the extent of the inconsistency; and

      * (d) if it is a category C past act or a category D past act--the nonextinguishment principle applies to the act.

         * Note: This subsection does not apply to the act if section 23C or 23G applies to the act.

     * (2) The extinguishment effected by this section does not by itself confer any right to eject or remove any Aboriginal persons who reside on or who exercise access over land or waters covered by a pastoral lease the grant, regrant or extension of which is validated by section 14.

##### 16  Preservation of beneficial reservations and conditions

     * If: 

      * (a) the act attributable to the Commonwealth contains a reservation or condition for the benefit of Aboriginal peoples or Torres Strait Islanders; or

      * (b) the doing of the act would affect rights or interests (other than native title rights and interests) of Aboriginal peoples or Torres Strait Islanders (whether arising under legislation, at common law or in equity and whether or not rights of usage);

     * nothing in section 15 affects that reservation or condition or those rights or interests.

##### 17  Entitlement to compensation

     * Extinguishment case

     * (1) If the act attributable to the Commonwealth is a category A past act or a category B past act, the native title holders are entitled to compensation for the act.

     * Nonextinguishment case

     * (2) If it is any other past act, the native title holders are entitled to compensation for the act if:

      * (a) the native title concerned is to some extent in relation to an onshore place and the act could not have been validly done on the assumption that the native title holders instead held ordinary title to:

       * (i) any land concerned; and

       * (ii) the land adjoining, or surrounding, any waters concerned; or

      * (b) the native title concerned is to some extent in relation to an offshore place; or

      * (c) the native title concerned relates either to land or to waters and the similar compensable interest test is satisfied in relation to the act.

     * Compensation for partial effect of act

     * (3) If the entitlement arises only because one, but not both, of paragraphs (2)(a) and (b) are satisfied, it is only an entitlement for the effect of the act on the native title in relation to the onshore place, or the offshore place, mentioned in the relevant paragraph.

     * Who pays compensation

     * (4) The compensation is payable by the Commonwealth.

##### 18  Where just terms invalidity

     * Section applies if acquisition of property other than on just terms

     * (1) This section applies if the invalidity (disregarding section 14) of a past act attributable to the Commonwealth results from a paragraph 51(xxxi) acquisition of property by the Commonwealth from any person having been made otherwise than on paragraph 51(xxxi) just terms.

     * Entitlement to compensation

     * (2) The person is entitled to compensation from the Commonwealth for the acquisition in accordance with Division 5 and, if that compensation does not ensure that the acquisition is made on paragraph 51(xxxi) just terms, to such additional compensation from the Commonwealth as is necessary to ensure that it is.

##### Subdivision B--Acts attributable to a State or Territory

##### 19  State/Territory acts may be validated

     * (1) If a law of a State or Territory contains provisions to the same effect as sections 15 and 16, the law of the State or Territory may provide that past acts attributable to the State or Territory are valid, and are taken always to have been valid.

     * Effect of validation of law

     * (2) To avoid any doubt, if a past act validated by subsection (1) is the making, amendment or repeal of legislation, subsection (1) does not validate:

      * (a) the grant or issue of any lease, licence, permit or authority; or

      * (b) the creation of any interest in relation to land or waters;

     * under any legislation concerned, unless the grant, issue or creation is itself a past act attributable to the State or Territory.

##### 20  Entitlement to compensation

     * Compensation where validation

     * (1) If a law of a State or Territory validates a past act attributable to the State or Territory in accordance with section 19, the native title holders are entitled to compensation if they would be so entitled under subsection 17(1) or (2) on the assumption that section 17 applied to acts attributable to the State or Territory.

     * Compensation where no validation

     * (2) Native title holders are entitled to compensation for the past act attributable to a State or Territory that, at the time when the claim for compensation is determined, has not been validated by the State or Territory in accordance with section 19.

     * Recovery of compensation

     * (3) The native title holders may recover the compensation from the State or Territory.

     * States or Territories may create compensation entitlement

     * (4) This section does not prevent a law of a State or Territory from creating an entitlement to compensation for a past act or for the validation of a past act.

         * Note: Paragraph 49(b) deals with the situation where there are multiple rights to compensation under Commonwealth, State and Territory laws.

#### Division 2A--Validation of intermediate period acts etc.

##### Subdivision A--Overview of Division

##### 21  Overview of Division

     * (1) In summary, this Division validates, or allows States and Territories to validate, certain acts that:

      * (a) took place on or after 1 January 1994 but on or before 23 December 1996; and

      * (b) would otherwise be invalid to any extent because they fail to pass any of the future act tests in Division 3 of Part 2 or for any other reason because of native title.

     * (2) The acts are called **_intermediate period acts_**; they are defined in section 232A.

     * (3) For this validation to apply, before the act was done, there must have been:

      * (a) a grant of a freehold estate or a lease (other than a mining lease); or

      * (b) a public work;

     * over any of the land or waters concerned.

     * (4) The Division also sets out the effect of such validation on native title. The effect varies depending on the nature of the act. For this purpose, different categories of intermediate period act are defined by sections 232B to 232E.

     * (5) The structure of the Division is very similar to that of Division 2 (which deals with validation of past acts).

##### Subdivision B--Acts attributable to the Commonwealth

##### 22A  Validation of Commonwealth acts

     * If an intermediate period act is an act attributable to the Commonwealth, the act is valid, and is taken always to have been valid.

##### 22B  Effect of validation on native title

     * Subject to subsection 24EBA(6), if an intermediate period act is an act attributable to the Commonwealth:

      * (a) if it is a category A intermediate period act to which subsection 232B(2), (3) or (4) (which deal with things such as the grant or vesting of freehold estates and certain leases) applies--the act extinguishes all native title in relation to the land or waters concerned; and

      * (b) if it is a category A intermediate period act to which subsection 232B(7) (which deals with public works) applies:

       * (i) the act extinguishes the native title in relation to the land or waters on which the public work concerned (on completion of its construction or establishment) was or is situated; and

       * (ii) the extinguishment is taken to have happened when the construction or establishment began; and

      * (c) if it is a category B intermediate period act that is wholly or partly inconsistent with the continued existence, enjoyment or exercise of the native title rights and interests concerned--the act extinguishes the native title to the extent of the inconsistency; and

      * (d) if it is a category C intermediate period act or a category D intermediate period act--the nonextinguishment principle applies to the act.

         * Note: This section does not apply to the act if section 23C or 23G applies to the act.

##### 22C  Preservation of beneficial reservations and conditions

     * If: 

      * (a) an intermediate period act attributable to the Commonwealth contains a reservation or condition for the benefit of Aboriginal peoples or Torres Strait Islanders; or

      * (b) the doing of an intermediate period act attributable to the Commonwealth would affect rights or interests (other than native title rights and interests) of Aboriginal peoples or Torres Strait Islanders (whether arising under legislation, at common law or in equity and whether or not rights of usage);

     * nothing in section 22B affects that reservation or condition or those rights or interests.

##### 22D  Entitlement to compensation

     * (1) If an intermediate period act is an act attributable to the Commonwealth, the native title holders are entitled to compensation for the act.

     * Who pays compensation

     * (2) The compensation is payable by the Commonwealth.

##### 22E  Where "just terms" invalidity

     * Section applies if acquisition of property other than on just terms

     * (1) This section applies if the invalidity (disregarding section 22A) of an intermediate period act attributable to the Commonwealth results from a paragraph 51(xxxi) acquisition of property by the Commonwealth from any person having been made otherwise than on paragraph 51(xxxi) just terms.

     * Entitlement to compensation

     * (2) The person is entitled to compensation from the Commonwealth for the acquisition in accordance with Division 5 and, if that compensation does not ensure that the acquisition is made on paragraph 51(xxxi) just terms, to such additional compensation from the Commonwealth as is necessary to ensure that it is.

##### 22EA  Requirement to notify: mining rights

     * (1) If:

      * (a) an act that is attributable to the Commonwealth consists of:

       * (i) the creation of a right to mine; or

       * (ii) the variation of such a right to extend the area to which it relates; or

      * (c) the acts took place before or take place after the commencement of this section; and

      * (d) the acts are not intermediate period acts; and

      * (e) the acts are invalid to any extent because of Division 3 of Part 2 or for any other reason, but would be valid to that extent if native title did not exist in relation to the lands;

     * (3) If the acts were **_previous nonexclusive possession acts _**(involving grants of nonexclusive agricultural leases or nonexclusive pastoral leases), they will have extinguished native title to the extent of any inconsistency.

     * (4) This Division also allows States and Territories to legislate, in respect of certain acts attributable to them, to extinguish native title in the same way as is done under this Division for Commonwealth acts.

     * Exclusion by regulation

     * (10) The regulations may provide that an act is not a **_previous exclusive possession act_**.

     * Effect of exclusions

     * (11) To avoid doubt, the fact that an act is, because of any of the previous subsections, not a previous exclusive possession act does not imply that the act is not valid.

#### Division 3--Future acts etc. and native title

##### Subdivision A--Preliminary

##### 24AA  Overview

     * Future acts

     * (1) This Division deals mainly with future acts, which are defined in section 233. Acts that do not affect native title are not **_future acts_**; therefore this Division does not deal with them (see section 227 for the meaning of acts that **_affect_** native title).

     * Validity of future acts

     * (2) Basically, this Division provides that, to the extent that a future act affects native title, it will be valid if covered by certain provisions of the Division, and invalid if not.

     * Validity under indigenous land use agreements

     * (3) A future act will be valid if the parties to certain agreements (called indigenous land use agreements--see Subdivisions B, C and D) consent to it being done and, at the time it is done, details of the agreement are on the Register of Indigenous Land Use Agreements. An indigenous land use agreement, details of which are on the Register, may also validate a future act (other than an intermediate period act) that has already been invalidly done.

     * Other bases for validity

     * (4) A future act will also be valid to the extent covered by any of the following:

      * (a) section 24FA (future acts where procedures indicate absence of native title);

      * (b) section 24GB (acts permitting primary production on nonexclusive agricultural or pastoral leases);

      * (c) section 24GD (acts permitting offfarm activities directly connected to primary production activities);

      * (d) section 24GE (granting rights to third parties etc. on nonexclusive agricultural or pastoral leases);

      * (e) section 24HA (management of water and airspace);

      * (f) section 24IA (acts involving renewals and extensions etc. of acts);

      * (fa) section 24JAA (public housing etc.);

      * (g) section 24JA (acts involving reservations, leases etc.);

      * (h) section 24KA (acts involving facilities for services to the public);

      * (i) section 24LA (low impact future acts);

      * (j) section 24MD (acts that pass the freehold test--but see subsection (5));

      * (k) section 24NA (acts affecting offshore places).

     * Right to negotiate

     * (5) In the case of certain acts covered by section 24IC (permissible lease etc. renewals) or section 24MD (acts that pass the freehold test), for the acts to be valid it is also necessary to satisfy the requirements of Subdivision P (which provides a "right to negotiate").

     * Extinguishment/nonextinguishment; procedural rights and compensation

     * (6) This Division provides that, in general, valid future acts are subject to the nonextinguishment principle. The Division also deals with procedural rights and compensation for the acts.

     * Activities etc. prevail over native title

     * (7) To avoid doubt, section 44H provides that a valid lease, licence, permit or authority, and any activity done under it, prevail over any native title rights and interests and their exercise.

     * Statutory access rights

     * (8) This Division confers access rights in respect of nonexclusive agricultural and nonexclusive pastoral leases on certain persons covered by registered native title claims (see Subdivision Q).

##### 24AB  Order of application of provisions

     * Indigenous land use agreement provisions

     * (1) To the extent that a future act is covered by section 24EB (which deals with the effect of indigenous land use agreements on future acts), it is not covered by any of the sections listed in paragraphs 24AA(4)(a) to (k).

     * Other provisions

     * (2) To the extent that a future act is covered by a particular section in the list in paragraphs 24AA(4)(a) to (k), it is not covered by a section that is lower in the list.

         * Note: It is important to know under which particular provision a future act is valid because the consequences in terms of compensation and procedural rights may be different.

     * (3) However, if, apart from subsection (2), a future act could be covered, to any extent, by both section 24JAA and section 24KA, then:

      * (a) if the act is notified in accordance with subsections 24JAA(10) to (12), it is not covered, to that extent, by section 24KA; and

      * (b) if the act is not notified in accordance with subsections 24JAA(10) to (12), it is not covered, to that extent, by section 24JAA.

         * Note: This allows for things, such as the construction of roads and electricity transmission or distribution facilities, to be done under either Subdivision JA or Subdivision K when done in connection with housing or facilities covered by Subdivision JA.

##### 24AC  Regulations about notification

     * The regulations may impose requirements to notify persons of acts, or classes of acts, that are to any extent valid under this Division (whether such notice is required to be given before or after the acts are done).

##### Subdivision B--Indigenous land use agreements (body corporate agreements)

##### 24BA  Indigenous land use agreements (body corporate agreements)

     * An agreement meeting the requirements of sections 24BB to 24BE is an **_indigenous land use agreement_**.

##### 24BB  Coverage of body corporate agreements

     * The agreement must be about one or more of the following matters in relation to an area: 

      * (a) the doing, or the doing subject to conditions (which may be about procedural matters), of particular future acts, or future acts included in classes;

      * (aa) particular future acts (other than intermediate period acts), or future acts (other than intermediate period acts) included in classes, that have already been done;

           * Note: Intermediate period acts are or can be validated only under Division 2A.

      * (ab) changing the effects, that are provided for by section 22B or by a law of a State or Territory that contains provisions to the same effect, of an intermediate period act or of intermediate period acts included in classes;

      * (b) withdrawing, amending, varying or doing any other thing in relation to an application under Division 1 of Part 3 in relation to land or waters in the area;

      * (e) extinguishing native title rights and interests in relation to land or waters in the area by the surrender of those rights and interests to the Commonwealth, a State or a Territory;

      * (eaa) providing a framework for the making of other agreements about matters relating to native title rights and interests;

      * (ea) compensation for any past act, intermediate period act or future act;

      * (f) any other matter concerning native title rights and interests in relation to the area.

         * Note 1: If the agreement involves consent to the doing of a future act or class of future act, or the doing of a future act or class of future act subject to conditions, it must include a statement to that effect: see paragraph 24EB(1)(b).

         * Note 2: If a future act covered by such a statement would otherwise be subject to the "right to negotiate" provisions in Subdivision P, the agreement must also include a statement that those provisions are not intended to apply: see paragraph 24EB(1)(c).

         * Note 3: If the agreement involves the extinguishment of native title by surrender, it must include a statement to that effect: see paragraph 24EB(1)(d).

##### 24BC  Body corporate agreements only where bodies corporate for whole area

     * The agreement must not be made unless there are registered native title bodies corporate in relation to all of the area.

##### 24BD  Parties to body corporate agreements

     * Registered native title bodies corporate

     * (1) All of the registered native title bodies corporate in relation to the area must be parties to the agreement.

     * Governments

     * (2) If the agreement makes provision for the extinguishment of native title rights and interests by surrendering them to the Commonwealth, a State or a Territory as mentioned in paragraph 24BB(e), the Commonwealth, State or Territory must be a party to the agreement. If the agreement does not make such provision, the Commonwealth, a State or a Territory may still be a party.

     * Others

##### Subdivision E--Effect of registration of indigenous land use agreements

##### 24EA  Contractual effect of registered agreement

      * (a) it were a contract among the parties to the agreement; and

      * (b) all persons holding native title in relation to any of the land or waters in the area covered by the agreement, who are not already parties to the agreement, were bound by the agreement in the same way as the registered native title bodies corporate, or the native title group, as the case may be.

         * Note: Section 199B specifies the details of the agreement that are required to be entered on the Register.

           * Note: The fact that, under the "right to negotiate" provisions in Subdivision P, agreements can be made after notice of an act is given as mentioned in section 29 does not prevent an indigenous land use agreement being made that consents to the doing of the act.

      * (d) if the act is the surrender of native title under an agreement covered by Subdivision B or C--the agreement also includes a statement to the effect that the surrender is intended to extinguish the native title rights and interests.

     * Validation of act

       * (i) if the application was certified by representative Aboriginal/Torres Strait Islander bodies as mentioned in paragraph 24CG(3)(a)--paragraph 203BE(5)(b); or

       * (ii) if the application included statements as mentioned in paragraph 24CG(3)(b) to the effect that certain requirements have been met (in summary, relating to identifying all native title holders and ensuring that they have authorised the making of the agreement)--that paragraph.

      * (a) he or she is entitled, in accordance with Division 5, to compensation for the act; and

      * (b) he or she may recover the compensation from:

       * (i) if subparagraph (ii) does not apply--the Crown in right of the Commonwealth, a State or a Territory (according to whether the act is attributable to the Commonwealth, the State or the Territory); or

       * (ii) any person or persons who, under an agreement in writing with the Commonwealth, the State or the Territory, are liable to pay the compensation.

##### 24EBA  Effect of registration on previous acts covered by indigenous land use agreements

      * (c) where, whether under the agreement or otherwise, a person other than the Crown in right of the Commonwealth, a State or a Territory is or may become liable to pay compensation in relation to the act or class of acts--that person is a party to the agreement.

     * Commonwealth future acts valid

     * (2) If subparagraph (1)(a)(i) or (ii) applies and the future act or class of future acts is attributable to the Commonwealth, the act or class of acts is valid, and is taken always to have been valid.

     * State or Territory laws may validate their future acts

     * (3) If subparagraph (1)(a)(i) or (ii) applies and the future act or class of future acts is attributable to a State or Territory, a law of the State or the Territory may provide that the act or class of acts is valid, and is taken always to have been valid. The law may do so by applying to all acts, to classes of acts, or to particular acts, to which subparagraph (1)(a)(i) or (ii) applies in respect of which the requirements of subsection (1) are or become satisfied.

     * Nonextinguishment principle applies to future acts

      * (a) make other agreements; or

      * (b) legislate in relation to the making of other agreements;

     * with native title holders that relate to their native title rights and interests (other than agreements consenting to the doing of future acts).

     * (1) If an area is subject to section 24FA protection (see sections 24FB, 24FC and 24FD) at a particular time:

      * (a) any future act by any person in relation to the area that is done at that time is valid; and

      * (b) if such an act extinguishes native title to any extent--the native title holders are entitled to compensation, in accordance with Division 5, for the act in so far as it has that effect; and

     * Activities prevail over native title etc.

     * (2) To avoid doubt:

      * (a) the doing of any activity mentioned in paragraph (1)(c) prevails over any native title rights and interests and any exercise of those rights and interests, but does not extinguish them; and

      * (b) the existence and exercise of native title rights and interests do not prevent the carrying on of any such activity.

       * (ii) is directly connected to the carrying on of any primary production activity on the area covered by the freehold estate or the agricultural lease or pastoral lease; and

       * (iii) takes place in an area adjoining or near the area covered by the freehold estate or the agricultural lease or pastoral lease; and

     * Validation of act

     * (3) If this Subdivision applies to a future act, the act is valid.

     * Nonextinguishment principle

     * (4) The nonextinguishment principle applies to the act.

     * Compensation

     * (6) The native title holders may recover the compensation from:

      * (a) if the act is attributable to the Commonwealth:

      * (b) there is no registered native title body corporate, or there are no registered native title bodies corporate, in relation to the whole of the land or waters in the area concerned;

     * then one way in which the person may give effect to the requirement is:

      * (d) if there are no such registered native title claimants--by ensuring that any representative Aboriginal/Torres Strait Islander bodies for that part of the area concerned for which there is no registered native title body corporate have an opportunity to comment on the doing of the act.

##### Subdivision L--Low impact future acts

##### 24LA  Low impact future acts

     * (1) This Subdivision applies to a future act in relation to particular land or waters if:

      * (a) the act takes place before, and does not continue after, an approved determination of native title is made in relation to the land or waters, if the determination is that native title exists; and

      * (b) the act does not consist of, authorise or otherwise involve:

     * (4) The nonextinguishment principle applies to the act.

##### Subdivision M--Acts passing the freehold test

##### 24MA  Legislative acts

     * This Subdivision applies to a future act if it is the making, amendment or repeal of legislation and:

      * (a) the act applies in the same way to the native title holders concerned as it would if they instead held ordinary title to the land (or to the land adjoining, or surrounding, the waters) affected; or

      * (b) the effect of the act on the native title in relation to the land or the waters is not such as to cause the native title holders to be in a more disadvantageous position at law than they would be if they instead held ordinary title to the land (or to the land adjoining, or surrounding, the waters).

         * Example 1: An example of a future act covered by paragraph (a) is the making of legislation that permits mining on land in respect of which there is either native title or ordinary title.

         * Example 2: An example of a future act covered by paragraph (b) is the amendment of legislation that permits mining on land that is subject to ordinary title so that it will also permit mining, on the same terms, on land in relation to which native title exists.

##### 24MB  Nonlegislative acts

     * Freehold test

     * (1) This Subdivision applies to a future act if:

      * (a) it is an act other than the making, amendment or repeal of legislation; and

      * (b) either:

       * (i) the act could be done in relation to the land concerned if the native title holders concerned instead held ordinary title to it; or

       * (ii) the act could be done in relation to the waters concerned if the native title holders concerned held ordinary title to the land adjoining, or surrounding, the waters; and

      * (c) a law of the Commonwealth, a State or a Territory makes provision in relation to the preservation or protection of areas, or sites, that may be:

       * (i) in the area to which the act relates; and

       * (ii) of particular significance to Aboriginal peoples or Torres Strait Islanders in accordance with their traditions.

         * Example: An example of a future act covered by this subsection is the grant of a mining lease over land in relation to which there is native title when a mining lease would also be able to be granted over the land if the native title holders instead held ordinary title to it.

     * Opal or gem mining

     * (2) This Subdivision also applies to a future act if:

      * (a) it is an act other than the making, amendment or repeal of legislation; and

      * (b) it is not covered by subsection (1); and

      * (c) it consists of the creation or variation of a right to mine for opals or gems; and

      * (d) a law of the Commonwealth, a State or a Territory makes provision in relation to the preservation or protection of areas, or sites, that may be:

       * (i) in the area to which the act relates; and

       * (ii) of particular significance to Aboriginal peoples or Torres Strait Islanders in accordance with their traditions.

##### 24MC  Only onshore places covered

     * However, this Subdivision only applies to a future act to the extent that it relates to an onshore place. A reference to an act to which this Subdivision applies is to be read as referring to the act to that extent only.

##### 24MD  Treatment of acts that pass the freehold test

     * Validation of act

     * (1) If this Subdivision applies to a future act, then, subject to Subdivision P (which deals with the right to negotiate), the act is valid.

     * (2) If:

      * (a) the act is the compulsory acquisition of the whole or part of any native title rights and interests under a law of the Commonwealth, a State or a Territory that permits both:

       * (i) the compulsory acquisition by the Commonwealth, the State or the Territory of native title rights and interests; and

       * (ii) the compulsory acquisition by the Commonwealth, the State or the Territory of nonnative title rights and interests in relation to land or waters; and

      * (b) the whole, or the equivalent part, of all nonnative title rights and interests, in relation to the land or waters to which the native title rights and interests that are compulsorily acquired relate, is also acquired (whether compulsorily or by surrender, cancellation or resumption or otherwise) in connection with the compulsory acquisition of the native title rights and interests; and

      * (ba) the practices and procedures adopted in acquiring the native title rights and interests are not such as to cause the native title holders any greater disadvantage than is caused to the holders of nonnative title rights and interests when their rights and interests are acquired;

     * then: 

      * (c) the compulsory acquisition extinguishes the whole or the part of the native title rights and interests; and

      * (d) if compensation on just terms is provided under a law of the Commonwealth, a State or a Territory to the native title holders for the compulsory acquisition, and they request that the whole or part of any such compensation should be in a form other than money, the person providing the compensation must:

       * (ii) negotiate in good faith in relation to the request; and

      * (e) if compensation on just terms is not provided under a law of the Commonwealth, a State or Territory to the native title holders for the compulsory acquisition, they are entitled to compensation for the acquisition in accordance with Division 5.

         * Note 1: Subdivision P (which deals with the right to negotiate) applies to some acquisitions.

         * Note 2: This subsection only deals with the case where native title rights and interests are compulsorily acquired. It is also possible for native title rights and interests to be acquired voluntarily by means of an indigenous land use agreement or an agreement covered by subsection (2A). In such cases, nonnative title rights and interests could be acquired either compulsorily or by some other means (e.g. voluntarily).

     * Extinguishment of native title by surrender in course of right to negotiate process

     * (2A) If:

      * (c) the agreement includes a statement to the effect that an act consisting of the surrender of the whole or part of the native title rights and interests is intended to extinguish the whole or the part of the native title rights and interests;

     * then: 

      * (d) the surrender extinguishes the whole or the part of the native title rights and interests; and

      * (e) no native title holder who is entitled to any benefit provided under the agreement is entitled to any compensation for the act under this Act, other than compensation provided for in the agreement; and

      * (f) any other native title holder is entitled to compensation for the act in accordance with Division 5.

     * Nonextinguishment and compensation

     * (3) In the case of any future act to which this Subdivision applies that is not covered by subsection (2) or (2A):

      * (a) the nonextinguishment principle applies to the act; and

      * (b) if the following conditions are satisfied:

       * (i) the similar compensable interest test is satisfied in relation to the act; and

       * (ii) the law mentioned in section 240 (which defines**_ similar compensable interest test_**) does not provide for compensation to the native title holders for the act;

      * the native title holders are entitled to compensation for the act in accordance with Division 5.

     * Who pays compensation

     * (4) The native title holders may recover the compensation from:

      * (a) if the act is attributable to the Commonwealth:

       * (i) if a law of the Commonwealth provides that a person other than the Crown in right of the Commonwealth is liable to pay the compensation--that person; or

       * (ii) if not--the Crown in right of the Commonwealth; or

      * (b) if the act is attributable to a State or Territory:

       * (i) if a law of the State or Territory provides that a person other than the Crown in any capacity is liable to pay the compensation--that person; or

       * (ii) if not--the Crown in right of the State or Territory.

     * Exception for certain lessees

     * (5) If:

      * (a) the act is the compulsory acquisition of the whole or part of any native title rights and interests; and

      * (b) the land or waters concerned are to any extent the subject of a nonexclusive agricultural lease or a nonexclusive pastoral lease;

     * then, despite subsection (4):

      * (c) the native title holders are not entitled to recover the compensation from the lessee; and

      * (d) if the act is attributable to the Commonwealth--the native title holders may recover the compensation from the Crown in right of the Commonwealth; and

      * (e) if the act is attributable to a State or Territory--the native title holders may recover the compensation from the Crown in right of the State or Territory.

     * Consequences of certain acts

     * (6) In the case of any future act to which this Subdivision applies, other than:

      * (a) an act to which Subdivision P (which deals with the right to negotiate) applies; or

      * (b) an act determined under section 26A to be an approved exploration etc. act; or

      * (c) an act determined under section 26B to be an approved gold or tin mining act; or

     * Procedural rights 

     * (6A) The native title holders, and any registered native title claimants in relation to the land or waters concerned, have the same procedural rights as they would have in relation to the act on the assumption that they instead held ordinary title to any land concerned and to the land adjoining, or surrounding, any waters concerned.

     * Other consequences

     * (6B) If the act is:

      * (a) the compulsory acquisition of native title rights and interests for the purpose of conferring rights or interests in relation to the land or waters concerned on persons other than the Commonwealth, the State or the Territory to which the act is attributable; or

       * (iii) any representative Aboriginal/Torres Strait Islander body in relation to the land or waters; and

       * (iv) the Registrar;

      * must consult any claimants, and bodies corporate, who object, about ways of minimising the act's impact on registered native title rights and interests in relation to the land or waters, and, if relevant, any access to the land or waters or the way in which any thing authorised by the act might be done; and

      * (f) if any claimant or body corporate objects, as mentioned in paragraph (d), to the doing of the act and so requests, the Commonwealth, the State or the Territory must ensure that the objection is heard by an independent person or body; and

      * (g) if the independent person or body hearing any objection as mentioned in paragraph (f) makes a determination upholding the objection, or that contains conditions about the doing of the act that relate to registered native title rights and interests, the determination must be complied with unless:

       * (i) the Minister of the Commonwealth, the State or the Territory responsible for indigenous affairs is consulted; and

       * (ii) the consultation is taken into account; and

       * (iii) it is in the interests of the Commonwealth, the State or the Territory not to comply with the determination.

     * Meaning of **determination**

     * **	(6C)	In paragraph (6B)(g):

     * **_determination _**includes recommendation.

     * **_in the interests of_** the Commonwealth, the State or the Territory includes:

##### Subdivision O--Future acts invalid unless otherwise provided

##### 24OA  Future acts invalid unless otherwise provided

     * Unless a provision of this Act provides otherwise, a future act is invalid to the extent that it affects native title.

##### Subdivision P--Right to negotiate

##### 25  Overview of Subdivision

     * (1) In summary, this Subdivision applies to certain future acts done by the Commonwealth, a State or a Territory that are of any of the following kinds:

      * (aa) certain acts covered by section 24IC (which deals with permissible lease etc. renewals);

      * (a) certain conferrals of mining rights;

      * (b) certain compulsory acquisitions of native title rights and interests;

      * (c) other acts approved by the Commonwealth Minister.

     * (2) Before the future act is done, the parties must negotiate with a view to reaching an agreement about the act.

     * (3) If they do not reach agreement, an arbitral body, or a Minister, will make a determination about the act instead.

     * (4) If the procedures in this Subdivision are not complied with, the act will be invalid to the extent that it affects native title.

     * (5) States and Territories may make their own laws as alternatives to this Subdivision. The Commonwealth Minister must be satisfied as to certain matters before such laws can take effect.

         * Note: The fact that action is being taken to comply with this Subdivision does not imply that action under another law, such as processing requests or applications in respect of the act, cannot be taken at the same time.

       * (i) in any case--the national interest; and

      * to make the determination at the time.

     * Relevant Minister may consider other matters

     * Right of Commonwealth to overrule

     * (2) If the Commonwealth Minister considers it to be in:

      * (a) in any case--the national interest; or

      * (b) if the act concerned is an act attributable to a State or Territory--the interests of the State or Territory;

     * to overrule a determination of the NNTT (other than a determination under subsection 32(4), which deals with the expedited procedure), the Commonwealth Minister may, by writing given to the NNTT, make a declaration in accordance with subsection (3).

     * Kinds of declaration

     * (3) The Minister concerned may make either of the following declarations:

       * (iii) regulations made under subsection (5A) are complied with.

     * General rule--project acts treated as a single act

     * (2) This Subdivision applies to all of the project acts as if they were a single act.

     * Conditions

     * (3) However, this does not mean that conditions of the kind mentioned in paragraph 31(1)(b), 36C(4)(c), 38(1)(c) or 42(3)(b) must:

      * (a) apply to all of the project acts comprising the single act; or

      * (b) be the same for all of the project acts to which they apply.

##### 43  Modification of Subdivision if satisfactory alternative State or Territory provisions

     * Determination about alternative provisions

     * (1) If:

      * (a) a law of a State or Territory provides for alternative provisions to those contained in this Subdivision in relation to some or all acts to which this Subdivision applies that are attributable to the State or Territory; and

      * (b) the Commonwealth Minister determines, by legislative instrument, that the alternative provisions comply with subsection (2);

     * then, while the determination is in force, the alternative provisions have effect instead of this Subdivision.

     * Requirement to be satisfied

     * (2) The alternative provisions comply with this subsection if, in the opinion of the Commonwealth Minister, they:

      * (a) contain appropriate procedures for notifying registered native title bodies corporate, representative bodies, registered native title claimants and potential native title claimants of the act; and

      * (b) require negotiation in good faith among the persons concerned; and

      * (c) provide for mediation by a person or body to assist in settling any dispute among the persons concerned regarding the act; and

      * (d) give registered native title bodies corporate and registered native title claimants the right to object against the act; and

      * (e) make provision on similar terms to section 30 and contain time limits similar to those applicable under this Subdivision; and

      * (f) provide that the body determining the objection consists of, or includes, persons enrolled for at least 5 years as legal practitioners of:

       * (i) the High Court; or

       * (ii) another federal court; or

       * (iii) the Supreme Court of a State or Territory; and

      * (g) make provision to the same effect as section 39 in relation to matters that are required to be taken into account by the body determining the objection; and

      * (h) if the alternative provisions involve the hearing and determination of the objection by a person or body other than the NNTT or a recognised State/Territory body for the State or Territory--provide for a member of the recognised State/Territory body (if any) or of the NNTT to participate in the determination; and

      * (i) provide that any decision of the body determining the objection may only be overruled on grounds of State or Territory interest or of national interest; and

      * (j) make appropriate provision for compensation for the act, including provision for:

       * (i) bank guarantees on similar terms to those in subsections 36C(5), 41(3) and 42(5), and regulations made for the purposes of subsections 36C(5A), 41(4) and 42(5A); or

       * (ii) for trusts on similar terms to those in subsections 36C(5B), 41(5) and 42(5B); and

      * (k) if the alternative provisions allow a Minister to make a determination in relation to the act in circumstances other than those covered in paragraph (i)--provide for those circumstances to be similar to those set out in section 36A and for requirements similar to those in sections 36B and 36C to apply.

     * Effect of including conjunctive agreement/determination provisions and expedited procedure provisions

     * (2A) If the only reason for the Commonwealth Minister not being of the opinion that the alternative provisions comply with subsection (2) is that they include conjunctive agreement/determination provisions or expedited procedure provisions (see subsection (5)), the alternative provisions nevertheless comply with subsection (2).

     * Revocation of determination

     * (3) If at any time the alternative provisions are amended so that they no longer comply with subsection (2), the Commonwealth Minister must:

      * (a) advise the State Minister or the Territory Minister concerned in writing of the fact; and

      * (b) if, at the end of 180 days after doing so, the alternative provisions do not comply and subparagraphs (c)(i) and (ii) do not apply--by legislative instrument, revoke the determination made under paragraph (1)(b); and

      * (c) if:

       * (i) at the end of 180 days after advising the State Minister or Territory Minister, the alternative provisions do not comply and the Commonwealth Minister is satisfied that the State Minister or the Territory Minister is using his or her best endeavours to ensure that the alternative provisions will comply; and

       * (ii) before the end of the 180 days, the Commonwealth Minister determined, by legislative instrument, that a further period should apply for the purposes of this paragraph; and

       * (iii) at the end of the further period, the alternative provisions still do not comply;

      * by legislative instrument, revoke the determination made under paragraph (1)(b).

     * (3A) If, at any time, the alternative provisions cease to have ongoing effect, the Commonwealth Minister must, by legislative instrument, revoke the determination made under paragraph (1)(b).

     * Regulations to make transitional provisions

     * (4) The regulations may prescribe any modifications of this Act that are necessary to deal with transitional matters arising from the making, amendment or revocation of determinations under this section.

     * Meaning of certain expressions

     * (5) In this section:

     * **_conjunctive agreement/determination provisions_** means provisions that:

      * (a) are included in alternative provisions; and

      * (b) in the opinion of the Commonwealth Minister, have an effect, in combination with the other alternative provisions, that is similar to the effect that subsection 26D(2) of this Act has in combination with the other provisions of this Subdivision.

     * **_expedited procedure provisions_** means provisions that:

      * (a) are included in alternative provisions; and

      * (b) in the opinion of the Commonwealth Minister, have an effect, in combination with the other alternative provisions, that is similar to the effect that section 32 of this Act has in combination with the other provisions of this Subdivision.

##### 43A  Exception to right to negotiate: satisfactory State/Territory provisions

     * Determination about alternative provisions

     * (1) If:

      * (a) a law or laws of a State or Territory provide for alternative provisions to those contained in this Subdivision in relation to some or all acts to which this Subdivision applies that:

       * (i) are attributable to the State or Territory; and

       * (ii) relate, to any extent, to an area of land or waters that is an alternative provision area (see subsection (2)); and

      * (b) the Commonwealth Minister determines, by legislative instrument, that the provisions comply with subsections (4) and (6) and that the requirements of subsection (7) are complied with;

     * then, subject to subsection (10), while the determination is in force, the alternative provisions have effect instead of this Subdivision.

     * Meaning of **alternative provision area**

     * **	(2)	An **_alternative provision area_** is:

      * (a) an area:

       * (i) that is, or was (whether before or after this Act commenced), covered by a freehold estate in fee simple or by a lease (other than a mining lease); and

       * (ii) over which all native title rights and interests have not been extinguished; or

         * Example 1: An example of such an area is an area covered by a nonexclusive agricultural lease or a nonexclusive pastoral lease (including one subject to section 47).

         * Example 2: An example of a freehold estate in fee simple over which all native title rights and interests may not have been extinguished is one whose grant or vesting is covered by subsection 23B(9), (9A), (9B) or (9C).

      * (b) an area that is, or was (whether before or after this Act commenced):

       * (i) covered by a reservation, proclamation, dedication, condition, permission or authority, made or conferred by the Crown in right of the State or Territory or by the making, amendment or repeal of legislation of the State or Territory, under which the whole or a part of the land or waters in the area was to be used for public purposes generally or for a particular purpose; and

       * (ii) in use for public purposes, for the particular purpose or for a similar purpose; or

         * Example: An example of an area covered by paragraph (b) is an area containing a national park.

      * (c) an area that, when the act is done, is wholly within a town or city (see section 251C).

     * Notification of proposed determination

     * (3) Before making the determination, the Commonwealth Minister must:

      * (a) notify all representative Aboriginal/Torres Strait Islander bodies for the land or waters concerned of the proposed determination; and

      * (b) invite submissions from them about the proposed determination; and

      * (c) consider any submissions made in response to the invitation.

     *  Requirement to be satisfied: procedures etc.

     * (4) For the purposes of paragraph (1)(b), the alternative provisions comply with this subsection if, in the opinion of the Commonwealth Minister, they:

      * (a) contain appropriate procedures for notifying each of the following that an act to which the provisions apply is to be done:

       * (i) any registered native title claimant (a **_claimant_**) in relation to any of the land or waters to which the act relates;

       * (ii) any registered native title body corporate (a **_body corporate_**) in relation to any of that land or waters;

       * (iii) any representative Aboriginal/Torres Strait Islander body in relation to any of that land or waters; and

      * (b) give any claimant or body corporate the right to object, within a specified period after the notification, to the doing of the act so far as it affects their registered native title rights and interests; and

      * (c) if the act is of the kind mentioned in subparagraph 26(1)(c)(iii) (which deals with certain compulsory acquisitions)--provide for consultation (including provide in relation to mediation) between:

       * (i) any claimants, and bodies corporate, who object; and

       * (ii) the State or Territory;

      * about ways of minimising the act's impact on registered native title rights and interests in relation to the land or waters concerned; and

      * (d) in any other case--provide for consultation (including provide in relation to mediation) between:

       * (i) any claimants, and bodies corporate, who object; and

       * (ii) the person who requested or applied for the doing of the act;

      * about ways of minimising the act's impact on registered native title rights and interests in relation to the land or waters concerned, including about any access to the land or waters or the way in which any thing authorised by the act might be done; and

      * (e) if any person objects as mentioned in paragraph (b), provide for the objection to be heard by an independent person or body; and

           * Example: The independent person or body could be a State or Territory tribunal which deals with acts of the kind concerned, for example, a mining warden where the act is the grant of a mining lease.

      * (f) provide for judicial review of the decision to do the act; and

           * Example: The judicial review could be by the Supreme Court of the State or Territory.

      * (g) provide that, if the independent person or body hearing any objection as mentioned in paragraph (e) makes a determination upholding the objection, or that contains conditions about the doing of the act that relate to registered native title rights and interests, the determination must be complied with unless:

       * (i) the Minister of the State or the Territory responsible for indigenous affairs is consulted; and

       * (ii) the consultation is taken into account; and

       * (iii) it is in the interests of the State or the Territory not to comply with the determination; and

      * (h) if the act is of the kind mentioned in subparagraph 26(1)(c)(iii) (which deals with certain compulsory acquisitions)--confer on each claimant and body corporate procedural rights that are not less favourable than those they would have on the assumption that they instead held ordinary title to any land concerned and to the land adjoining, or surrounding, any waters concerned.

     * Meaning of **determination**

     * **	(5)	In paragraph (4)(g):

     * **_determination _**includes recommendation.

     * **_in the interests of_** the State or the Territory includes:

      * (a) for the social or economic benefit of the State or the Territory (including of Aboriginal peoples and Torres Strait Islanders); and

      * (b) in the interests of the relevant region or locality in the State or the Territory.

     *  Requirement to be satisfied: compensation

     * (6) For the purposes of paragraph (1)(b), the alternative provisions comply with this subsection if, in the opinion of the Commonwealth Minister, they provide for compensation for the effect of the act on native title to be payable and for any dispute about the compensation to be determined by an independent person or body.

     *  Requirement to be satisfied: preservation of areas of significance

     * (7) For the purposes of paragraph (1)(b), the requirements of this subsection are complied with if, in the opinion of the Commonwealth Minister, a law of the Commonwealth, the State or the Territory provides, for the whole of the land or waters to which the alternative provisions relate, in relation to the preservation or protection of areas, or sites, that may be of particular significance to Aboriginal peoples or Torres Strait Islanders in accordance with their traditions.

     * Different provisions for different kinds of land or waters

     * (8) Laws of a State or Territory may make different provision under subsection (1) in relation to different kinds of land or waters.

         * Note: In such a case, the Commonwealth Minister would need to make separate determinations under that subsection.

     * Revocation of determination

     * (9) If at any time the alternative provisions are amended so that they no longer comply as mentioned in paragraph (1)(b), the Commonwealth Minister must:

      * (a) advise the State Minister or the Territory Minister concerned in writing of the fact; and

      * (b) if, at the end of 90 days after doing so, the alternative provisions do not comply and subparagraphs (c)(i) and (ii) do not apply--by legislative instrument, revoke the determination made under paragraph (1)(b); and

      * (c) if:

       * (i) at the end of 90 days after advising the State Minister or Territory Minister, the alternative provisions do not comply and the Commonwealth Minister is satisfied that the State Minister or the Territory Minister is using his or her best endeavours to ensure that the alternative provisions will comply; and

       * (ii) before the end of the 90 days, the Commonwealth Minister determined, by legislative instrument, that a further period should apply for the purposes of this paragraph; and

       * (iii) at the end of the further period, the alternative provisions still do not comply;

      * by legislative instrument, revoke the determination made under paragraph (1)(b).

     * (9A) If, at any time, the alternative provisions cease to have ongoing effect, the Commonwealth Minister must, by legislative instrument, revoke the determination made under paragraph (1)(b).

     * Exclusion of certain compulsory acquisitions

     * (10) The alternative provisions do not apply to an act of the kind mentioned in subparagraph 26(1)(c)(iii) (which deals with certain compulsory acquisitions) if the act involves the acquisition of native title rights and interests in relation to land or waters in both an alternative provision area and an area that is not an alternative provision area.

     * Regulations to make transitional provisions

     * (11) The regulations may prescribe any modifications of this Act that are necessary to deal with transitional matters arising from the making, amendment or revocation of determinations under this section.

##### 43B  Mining rights covering both alternative provision area and other area

     * If: 

      * (a) a particular future act is the creation or variation of a right to mine in both an alternative provision area (as defined in subsection 43A(2)) and an area (the **_other area_**) that is not an alternative provision area; and

      * (b) because of section 43A, provisions of a State or Territory law would, apart from this section, have effect in relation to the act;

     * then, for the purposes of this Subdivision:

      * (c) the act is taken to consist of 2 separate acts, as follows:

       * (i) one act consisting of the creation or variation of that right to mine, but only in the alternative provision area; and

       * (ii) the other act consisting of the creation or variation of that right to mine, but only in the other area; and

      * (d) the act mentioned in subparagraph (c)(ii) is taken to be done only when the right concerned is first exercised in the other area.

         * Note: In effect, this section splits the act in 2 (for "right to negotiate" purposes only). Only the "act" mentioned in subparagraph (c)(i)--not the "act" mentioned in subparagraph (c)(ii)--attracts the alternative provisions under section 43A.

##### 44  Additional operation of Subdivision

     * Without affecting its operation apart from this section, this Subdivision also has the effect that it would have if each reference to a grantee party were, by express provision, confined to a grantee party that is a foreign corporation, or a trading or financial corporation formed within the limits of the Commonwealth.

##### Subdivision Q--Conferral of access rights on native title claimants in respect of nonexclusive agricultural and pastoral leases

##### 44A  Conditions for Subdivision to apply

     * (1) This Subdivision applies if the conditions in this section are met.

     * Person in claim group in respect of registered claim over nonexclusive agricultural or pastoral lease

     * (2) A person must be included in the native title claim group (see section 253) in relation to a claim:

      * (a) for which there is an entry on the Register of Native Title Claims; and

           * Note: Under paragraph 190(4)(d), entries on the Register must be removed when the application in question is withdrawn, dismissed or otherwise finalised.

      * (b) that relates to any extent to an area that is covered by a nonexclusive agricultural lease or a nonexclusive pastoral lease.

     * Access for traditional activities

     * (3) Either:

      * (a) as at the end of 23 December 1996, the person included in the native title claim group must have regularly had physical access to the whole or part (the **_traditional access area_**) of the area that is covered by both the claim and the lease for the purpose of carrying on one or more traditional activities (see subsection (4)) of the person; or

      * (b) the person included in the native title claim group must be a descendant of a person who, as at 23 December 1996, regularly had such physical access.

     * Traditional activity

     * (4) A **_traditional activity_** is an activity of any of the following kinds, but only if it is carried on for traditional purposes of Aboriginal people or  Islanders:

      * (a) hunting, fishing, gathering or camping;

      * (b) performing rites or other ceremonies;

      * (c) visiting sites of significance.

##### 44B  Rights of access for traditional activities

     * Conferral of rights

     * (1) At all times while this Subdivision applies, the person included in the native title claim group has a right:

      * (a) to have access, in the same way and to the same extent as the access mentioned in subsection 44A(3), to the traditional access area for the purpose of carrying on the one or more traditional activities in that area in the same way and to the same extent as they were carried on pursuant to the access mentioned in that subsection; and

      * (b) to carry on those activities in that area in that way and to that extent.

     * Lessee etc. rights prevail

     * (2) The rights of:

      * (a) the lessee under the lease; or

      * (b) any person with nonnative title rights or interests in relation to the traditional access area;

     * prevail over the rights conferred by subsection (1). To avoid doubt, the existence and exercise of the rights conferred by subsection (1) do not prevent the doing of any thing in exercise of the rights of the lessee or person with the nonnative title rights or interests.

     * Agreements about rights

     * (3) The lessee or any person with nonnative title rights or interests in relation to the traditional access area may make an agreement with the person included in the native title claim group about:

      * (a) the manner of exercise of any of the rights conferred by subsection (1); or

      * (b) the variation of any of those rights.

         * Note: For example, an agreement might be made requiring notification of intended exercise of the rights.

     * Assistance in making agreements

     * (4) Any persons wishing to make such an agreement may request assistance from the NNTT or a recognised State/Territory body in negotiating the agreement.

     * Information obtained in providing assistance not to be used or disclosed in other contexts

     * (4A) The NNTT must not use or disclose information to which it has had access only because it provided assistance in negotiating the agreement for any purpose other than providing that assistance without the prior consent of the person who provided the NNTT with the information.

     * Statutory access rights do not amount to native title

     * (5) To avoid doubt, the fact that the person satisfies the conditions in section 44A does not mean that the person has native title rights and interests in relation to the traditional access area.

##### 44C  Suspension of native title rights

     * (1) For so long as the person included in the native title claim group has rights conferred by subsection 44B(1), no person can enforce any native title rights or interests in relation to the whole or part of the land or waters covered by the lease, except in proceedings before the Federal Court or a recognised State/Territory body that are related to the making of an approved determination of native title.

     * Other provisions not affected

     * (2) Subsection (1) does not affect the operation of any other provision of this Act.

         * Note: The "right to negotiate" provisions in Subdivision P are an example of provisions that are not intended to be affected.

##### 44D  Certain other laws not affected

     * Laws etc. of benefit to Aboriginal peoples or  Islanders

     * (1) This Subdivision does not affect:

      * (a) any reservation or condition for the benefit of Aboriginal peoples or Torres Strait Islanders contained:

       * (i) in any law of the Commonwealth, a State or a Territory; or

       * (ii) elsewhere; or

      * (b) the operation of any law of the Commonwealth, a State or a Territory that allows for the granting of access rights to Aboriginal peoples or Torres Strait Islanders; or

      * (c) the operation of any law of the Commonwealth, a State or Territory that relates to the preservation or protection of any area or site of particular significance to Aboriginal peoples or Torres Strait Islanders in accordance with their traditions.

     * Laws of general application

     * (2) This Subdivision is not intended to imply that, in exercising rights conferred by subsection 44B(1), a person is not subject to laws of the Commonwealth, a State or a Territory that are of general application.

##### 44E  Federal Court jurisdiction

     * The Federal Court may, in its discretion, refuse to exercise the jurisdiction conferred on it under subsection 213(2) in relation to a matter involving a right conferred by subsection 44B(1) for the reason that an adequate alternative means of resolving the matter is available.

##### 44F  Request for mediation

     * (1) If all of the persons involved in any dispute about a right conferred by subsection 44B(1) agree, they may request the NNTT or a recognised State/Territory body to mediate in the dispute.

         * Note: Persons wishing to make an indigenous land use agreement about access in general may request assistance from the NNTT or a recognised State/Territory body in negotiating the agreement: see sections 24BF, 24CF and 24DG.

     * (2) The NNTT must not use or disclose information to which it has had access only because it mediated in the dispute for any purpose other than mediating the dispute without the prior consent of the person who provided the NNTT with the information.

##### 44G  Other mediation, arbitration and agreements not excluded by Subdivision

     * Nothing in this Subdivision prevents: 

      * (a) mediation or arbitration by any person or body of any matter arising in relation to a right conferred by subsection 44B(1); or

      * (b) the making or enforcing of agreements about access to the area covered by the nonexclusive agricultural lease or the nonexclusive pastoral lease other than under rights conferred by subsection 44B(1).

#### Division 4--Other provisions relating to native title

##### 44H  Rights conferred by valid leases etc.

     * To avoid doubt, if:

      * (a) the grant, issue or creation of a lease, licence, permit or authority is valid (including because of any provision of this Act); and

      * (b) the lease, licence, permit or authority requires or permits the doing of any activity (whether or not subject to any conditions); and

      * (ba) an activity is done in accordance with the lease, licence, permit or authority and any such conditions;

     * then: 

      * (c) the requirement or permission, and the doing of the activity, prevail over any native title rights and interests and any exercise of those rights and interests, but do not extinguish them; and

     * (7) If the person does not transfer the property or provide the goods or services in accordance with the recommendation, the person claiming to be entitled to the compensation may request the court, person or body to determine instead that the whole or the part of the compensation concerned is to consist of the payment of money.

     * Where recommendation complied with

     *  Amending Register after amendment of claims: recognised bodies

     * (2) If a recognised State/Territory body notifies the Registrar of an amendment of an application containing a claim that is on the Register, the Registrar must, as soon as practicable:

      * (a) if the claim as set out in the amended application has been found to satisfy conditions equivalent to those set out in sections 190B and 190C--amend the Register to reflect the amendment; or

      * (b) if the claim as set out in the amended application has been found not to satisfy conditions equivalent to those set out in sections 190B and 190C--amend the Register to remove any entry relating to the claim.

     *  Amending Register after amendment of claims: other cases

     * (3) If the Registrar is given a copy of an amended application under subsection 64(4) that contains a claim or amends a claim, the Registrar must, as soon as practicable:

      * (a) amend the Register to reflect the amendment if:

       * (i) the claim is accepted for registration under section 190A; or

       * (ii) the claim is accepted for registration on reconsideration under section 190E; or

       * (iii) the claim is accepted for registration under section 190A but, because subsection 190A(1A) applies, the Registrar need not consider the claim made in an amended application; or

      * (b) if the claim is not accepted for registration under section 190A or in response to notification by the NNTT under section 190E--amend the Register to remove any entry relating to the claim.

     * Amending Register where additional information provided

     * (3A) If:

      * (a) the Registrar accepts for registration a claim made in an application under section 63 or an amended application under subsection 64(4); and

      * (b) in accordance with this section, the Registrar includes in the Register details of the claim and a description of the nature and extent of the native title rights and interests concerned; and

      * (c) afterwards, but before a native title determination in relation to the application or amended application is made, the applicant provides to the Registrar further information relating to any native title rights and interests that were claimed in the application but whose details and description were not included in the Register; and

      * (d) the Registrar considers that, if the information had been provided before the claim had been accepted for registration, the details and description would have been included in the Register;

     * the Registrar must amend the Register to include the details and description.

     * Entries removed or amended after determination, decision or withdrawal

     * (4) If:

      * (a) the Registrar is notified under section 189 or 189A of a decision or determination covering a claim; or

      * (b) the Registrar is notified by a recognised State/Territory body of a decision or determination covering a claim; or

      * (c) the Registrar is notified that an application that contained a claim has been withdrawn;

     * the Registrar must, as soon as practicable:

      * (d) if the application in question has been withdrawn, dismissed or otherwise finalised--remove the entry on the Register that relates to the claim; or

      * (da) if an approved determination of native title is made to the effect that native title exists in relation to an area:

       * (i) but no determination has yet been made under section 56; or

       * (ii) a determination has been made under section 56 that the native title rights and interests are to be held by the common law holders, but no determination has yet been made under subsection 57(2) of which prescribed body corporate is to perform the functions mentioned in subsection 57(3);

      * amend the entry on the Register that relates to the claim so that it reflects that fact; or

      * (e) in any other case--amend the entry on the Register that relates to the claim so that it only relates to the matters in relation to which the application has not been finalised.

           * Note: If an application has been finalised in relation to part of the area claimed, the Register would be amended to remove references to that area. If the application has been finalised by an approved determination of native title, that determination would be entered on the National Native Title Register.

##### 190A  Registrar to consider claims

     * Claims made to Federal Court

     * (1) If the Registrar is given a copy of a claimant application under section 63 or subsection 64(4), the Registrar must, in accordance with this section, consider the claim made in the application.

         * Note: Unless subsection (1A) applies, in the case of an amended application (under subsection 64(4)), the Registrar would be required to consider the claim in the amended application even if the Registrar had already accepted for registration the claim in the original application. In such a case, if the claim in the amended application were then accepted for registration, the Registrar would be required under subsection 190(3) to amend the Native Title Register to reflect the amendment.

     * Exception for certain amended claims

     * (1A) Despite subsection (1), if:

      * (a) the Registrar is given a copy of an amended application under subsection 64(4) that amends a claim; and

      * (b) the application was amended because an order was made under section 87A by the Federal Court; and

      * (c) the Registrar has already considered the claim, as it stood before the application was amended;

     * the Registrar need not consider the claim made in the amended application.

     * Effect of certain notices

     * (2) If, either before the Registrar begins to do so or while he or she is doing so, a notice is given in accordance with:

      * (b) section 29; or

      * (c) a provision of a law of a State or Territory that corresponds to section 29 and is covered by a determination in force under section 43; or

      * (d) a provision of a law of a State or Territory that corresponds to section 29 and is covered by a determination in force under section 43A;

     * in relation to an act affecting any of the land or waters in the area covered by the application, the Registrar must use his or her best endeavours to finish considering the claim by the end of:

      * (e) in a paragraph (a) case--2 months after the notice is given; or

      * (f) in a paragraph (b) case--4 months after the notification day specified in the notice; or

      * (g) in a paragraph (c) case--the period, in the law of the State or Territory, that corresponds to the period of 4 months mentioned in paragraph 30(1)(a); or

      * (h) in a paragraph (d) case--the period at the end of which any person who is a registered native title claimant or registered native title body corporate has a right to be consulted about the act, to object to the act or to participate in negotiations about the act.

      * (b) any information obtained by the Registrar as a result of any searches conducted by the Registrar of registers of interests in relation to land or waters maintained by the Commonwealth, a State or a Territory; and

      * (c) to the extent that it is reasonably practicable to do so in the circumstances--any information supplied by the Commonwealth, a State or a Territory, that, in the Registrar's opinion, is relevant to whether any one or more of the conditions set out in section 190B or 190C are satisfied in relation to the claim; 

     * and may have regard to such other information as he or she considers appropriate.

     * Information about other rights and interests

     * (4) Without limiting subsection (3), information mentioned in that subsection may include information about current or previous nonnative title rights and interests in, or in relation to, the land or waters in the area covered by the application.

     * Effect of paragraph (3)(b)

     * (5) The fact that no information of the kind referred to in paragraph (3)(b) has been supplied at a particular time does not prevent the Registrar accepting a claim for registration under this section.

     * Notification about amending application

     * (5A) Before the Registrar has decided whether or not to accept the claim for registration, he or she may notify the applicant that the application may be amended under the Federal Court Rules.

     * Test for registration

     * (6) The Registrar must accept the claim for registration if:

      * (a) either:

       * (i) the claim was made in an application given to the Registrar under section 63; or

      * (b) the Registrar accepted the earlier claim for registration under subsection (6) of this section; and

      * (c) the later claim was made in an application given to the Registrar under subsection 64(4) that amends the earlier application; and

      * (d) the Registrar is satisfied that the only effect of the amendment is to do one or more of the following:

       * (i) reduce the area of land or waters covered by the application, in circumstances where the information and map contained in the application, as amended, are sufficient for it to be said with reasonable certainty whether native title rights and interests are claimed in relation to particular land or waters;

       * (ii) remove a right or interest from those claimed in the application;

       * (iii) change the name in the application of the representative body, or one of the representative bodies, recognised for the area covered by the application, in circumstances where the body's name has been changed or the body has been replaced with another representative body or a body to whom funding is made available under section 203FE;

       * (iv) change the name in the application of the body to whom funding was made available under section 203FE in relation to all or part of the area covered by the application, in circumstances where the body's name has been changed or the body has been replaced by another such body or a representative body;

       * (v) alter the address for service of the person who is, or persons who are, the applicant.

     * (6B) If neither subsection (6) nor (6A) applies, the Registrar must not accept the claim for registration.

      * (a) before the Registrar has decided whether or not to accept the claim for registration; or

      * (b) after the Registrar has decided to accept the claim for registration but before the Registrar has included details of the claim in the Register of Native Title Claims; 

     * the Registrar is notified under section 189 or 189A of a decision or determination to the effect that the application has been dismissed or otherwise finalised, or is notified that the application has been withdrawn, the Registrar must not:

      * (c) decide whether or not to accept the claim for registration; or

      * (d) enter the details in the Register;

     * as the case requires.

##### 190B  Registration: conditions about merits of the claim

     * (1) This section contains the conditions mentioned in subparagraph 190A(6)(b)(i).

     * Identification of area subject to native title

     * (2) The Registrar must be satisfied that the information and map contained in the application as required by paragraphs 62(2)(a) and (b) are sufficient for it to be said with reasonable certainty whether native title rights and interests are claimed in relation to particular land or waters.

     * Identification of native title claim groups

     * (3) The Registrar must be satisfied that:

      * (a) the persons in the native title claim group are named in the application; or

      * (b) the persons in that group are described sufficiently clearly so that it can be ascertained whether any particular person is in that group.

     * Identification of claimed native title

     * (4) The Registrar must be satisfied that the description contained in the application as required by paragraph 62(2)(d) is sufficient to allow the native title rights and interests claimed to be readily identified.

     * Factual basis for claimed native title

     * (5) The Registrar must be satisfied that the factual basis on which it is asserted that the native title rights and interests claimed exist is sufficient to support the assertion. In particular, the factual basis must support the following assertions:

      * (a) that the native title claim group have, and the predecessors of those persons had, an association with the area; and

      * (b) that there exist traditional laws acknowledged by, and traditional customs observed by, the native title claim group that give rise to the claim to native title rights and interests; and

      * (c) that the native title claim group have continued to hold the native title in accordance with those traditional laws and customs.

     * Prima facie case

     * (6) The Registrar must consider that, prima facie, at least some of the native title rights and interests claimed in the application can be established.

         * Note: If the claim is accepted for registration, the Registrar must, under paragraph 186(1)(g), enter on the Register of Native Title Claims details of only those claimed native title rights and interests that can, prima facie, be established. Only those rights and interests are taken into account for the purposes of subsection 31(2) (which deals with negotiation in good faith in a "right to negotiate" process) and subsection 39(1) (which deals with criteria for making arbitral body determinations in a "right to negotiate" process).

     * Physical connection

     * (7) The Registrar must be satisfied that at least one member of the native title claim group:

      * (a) currently has or previously had a traditional physical connection with any part of the land or waters covered by the application; or

      * (b) previously had and would reasonably have been expected currently to have a traditional physical connection with any part of the land or waters but for things done (other than the creation of an interest in relation to land or waters) by:

       * (i) the Crown in any capacity; or

       * (ii) a statutory authority of the Crown in any capacity; or

       * (iii) any holder of a lease over any of the land or waters, or any person acting on behalf of such a holder of a lease.

     * No failure to comply with section 61A

     * (8) The application and accompanying documents must not disclose, and the Registrar must not otherwise be aware, that, because of section 61A (which forbids the making of applications where there have been previous native title determinations or exclusive or nonexclusive possession acts), the application should not have been made.

     * No extinguishment etc. of claimed native title

     * (9) The application and accompanying documents must not disclose, and the Registrar must not otherwise be aware, that:

      * (a) to the extent that the native title rights and interests claimed consist of or include ownership of minerals, petroleum or gas--the Crown in right of the Commonwealth, a State or a Territory wholly owns the minerals, petroleum or gas; or

      * (b) to the extent that the native title rights and interests claimed relate to waters in an offshore place--those rights and interests purport to exclude all other rights and interests in relation to the whole or part of the offshore place; or

      * (c) in any case--the native title rights and interests claimed have otherwise been extinguished (except to the extent that the extinguishment is required to be disregarded under subsection 47(2), 47A(2) or 47B(2)).

     * (1) This section contains the conditions mentioned in subparagraph 190A(6)(b)(ii).

     * Information etc. required by sections 61 and 62

     * (2) The Registrar must be satisfied that the application contains all details and other information, and is accompanied by any affidavit or other document, required by sections 61 and 62.

     * No previous overlapping claim groups

     * (3) The Registrar must be satisfied that no person included in the native title claim group for the application (the **_current application_**) was a member of the native title claim group for any previous application, if:

      * (a) the previous application covered the whole or part of the area covered by the current application; and

      * (b) an entry relating to the claim in the previous application was on the Register of Native Title Claims when the current application was made; and

      * (c) the entry was made, or not removed, as a result of consideration of the previous application under section 190A.

     * Identity of claimed native title holders

     * (4) The Registrar must be satisfied that either of the following is the case:

      * (a) the application has been certified under Part 11 by each representative Aboriginal/Torres Strait Islander body that could certify the application in performing its functions under that Part; or

           * Note: An application can be certified under section 203BE, or may have been certified under the former paragraph 202(4)(d). A representative Aboriginal/Torres Strait Islander body may certify the application, even if it is only the representative body for part of the area claimed.

      * (b) the applicant is a member of the native title claim group and is authorised to make the application, and deal with matters arising in relation to it, by all the other persons in the native title claim group.

         * Note: The word **_authorise_** is defined in section 251B.

     * Certification not affected if Aboriginal/Torres Strait Islander body subsequently ceases to be recognised

     * (4A) To avoid doubt, the certification of an application under Part 11 by a representative Aboriginal/Torres Strait Islander body is not affected merely because, after certification, the recognition of the body as the representative Aboriginal/Torres Strait Islander body for the area concerned is withdrawn or otherwise ceases to have effect.

     * Requirements for uncertified applications

     * (5) If the application has not been certified as mentioned in paragraph (4)(a), the Registrar cannot be satisfied that the condition in subsection (4) has been satisfied unless the application:

      * (a) includes a statement to the effect that the requirement set out in paragraph (4)(b) has been met; and

      * (b) briefly sets out the grounds on which the Registrar should consider that it has been met.

##### 190D  If the claim cannot be registered--notice of decision

     * (1) If the Registrar does not accept the claim for registration, the Registrar must, as soon as practicable, give the applicant and the Federal Court written notice of his or her decision not to accept the claim, including:

      * (a) if the Registrar does not accept the claim because the Registrar is notified by the NNTT under section 190E that he or she should not do so--a copy of the NNTT's statement of reasons for its decision; or

      * (b) otherwise--a statement of the Registrar's reasons for his or her decision.

     * Content of notice where failure to satisfy physical connection test

     * (2) If the only reason why the claim is not accepted for registration is that the condition in subsection 190B(7) (which is about a physical connection with the claim area) is not satisfied, the notice must advise the applicant of the applicant's right to make an application to the Federal Court under section 190F and of the power of the Court to make an order in accordance with that section in respect of the application.

     * Statements of reasons must specify whether section 190B satisfied

     * (3) If the Registrar's decision not to accept the claim is not in response to notification by the NNTT under section 190E, the Registrar's statement of reasons for the decision must include a statement on:

      * (a) whether, in the opinion of the Registrar, the claim for registration satisfies all of the conditions in section 190B; and

      * (b) whether, in the opinion of the Registrar, it is not possible to determine whether the claim for registration satisfies all of the conditions in section 190B because of a failure to satisfy section 190C.

##### 190E  If the claim cannot be registered--reconsideration by the NNTT

     * Application to reconsider a claim

     * (1) If the Registrar gives the applicant a notice under subsection 190D(1), then, subject to subsections (3) and (4), the applicant may apply to the NNTT to reconsider the claim made in the application.

     * A future act is an **_act attracting the expedited procedure_** if:

      * (a) the act is not likely to interfere directly with the carrying on of the community or social activities of the persons who are the holders (disregarding any trust created under Division 6 of Part 2) of native title in relation to the land or waters concerned; and

      * (b) the act is not likely to interfere with areas or sites of particular significance, in accordance with their traditions, to the persons who are the holders (disregarding any trust created under Division 6 of Part 2) of the native title in relation to the land or waters concerned; and

      * (c) the act is not likely to involve major disturbance to any land or waters concerned or create rights whose exercise is likely to involve major disturbance to any land or waters concerned.

##### 237A  Extinguish

     * The word **_extinguish_**, in relation to native title, means permanently extinguish the native title. To avoid any doubt, this means that after the extinguishment the native title rights and interests cannot revive, even if the act that caused the extinguishment ceases to have effect.

##### 238  Nonextinguishment principle

     * Effect of references

     * (1) This section sets out the effect of a reference to the nonextinguishment principle applying to an act.

     * (2) If the act affects any native title in relation to the land or waters concerned, the native title is nevertheless not extinguished, either wholly or partly.

     * Rights and interests wholly ineffective

     * (3) In such a case, if the act is wholly inconsistent with the continued existence, enjoyment or exercise of the native title rights and interests, the native title continues to exist in its entirety but the rights and interests have no effect in relation to the act.

     * Rights and interests partly ineffective

     * (4) If the act is partly inconsistent with the continued existence, enjoyment or exercise of the native title rights and interests, the native title continues to exist in its entirety, but the rights and interests have no effect in relation to the act to the extent of the inconsistency.

     * Who the native title holders are

     * (5) Despite the fact that the native title rights and interests have no effect (as mentioned in subsection (3)) or have only limited effect (as mentioned in subsection (4)) in relation to the act, the persons who are entitled in accordance with the traditional laws and customs, as applying from time to time, to possess those rights and interests continue to be the native title holders, subject to Division 6 of Part 2 (which deals with the holding of native title on trust).

     * Complete removal of act or its effects

     * (6) If the act or its effects are later wholly removed or otherwise wholly cease to operate, the native title rights and interests again have full effect.

     * Partial removal of act or its effects

     * (7) If the act or its effects are later removed only to an extent, or otherwise cease to operate only to an extent, the native title rights and interests again have effect to that extent.

     * Example of operation of section

     * (8) An example of the operation of this section is its application to a category C past act consisting of the grant of a mining lease that confers exclusive possession over an area of land or waters in relation to which native title exists. In such a case the native title rights and interests will continue to exist but will have no effect in relation to the lease while it is in force. However, after the lease concerned expires (or after any extension, renewal or regrant of it to which subsection 228(3), (4) or (9) applies expires), the rights and interests again have full effect.

##### 239  Act attributable to the Commonwealth, a State or a Territory

      * (a) the Crown in right of the Commonwealth, the State or the Territory; or

##### 240  Similar compensable interest test

      * (a) the native title concerned relates to an onshore place; and

      * (b) the compensation would, apart from this Act, be payable under any law for the act on the assumption that the native title holders instead held ordinary title to any land or waters concerned and to the land adjoining, or surrounding, any waters concerned.
