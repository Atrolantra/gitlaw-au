### Part 3--Regulation of securitysensitive biological agents

#### Division 1--Preliminary

##### 30  Object of Part

    * (1) The object of this Part is to give effect to Australia's obligations to establish controls for the security of certain biological agents that could be used as weapons.

    * (2) To achieve this object, this Part provides for:

     * (a) the collection of certain information about securitysensitive biological agents and about biological agents suspected on the basis of testing in a laboratory of being securitysensitive biological agents; and

     * (aa) the recording on a national register of information about the nature and location of securitysensitive biological agents legitimately handled by entities in Australia; and

     * (b) requirements to be complied with for the secure handling of securitysensitive biological agents and biological agents suspected on the basis of testing in a laboratory of being securitysensitive biological agents; and

     * (c) monitoring of compliance with reporting and handling requirements through an inspection program; and

     * (d) restrictions in relation to the handling of securitysensitive biological agents.

#### Division 2--The List of Securitysensitive Biological Agents

##### 31  Establishment of the List of Securitysensitive Biological Agents

    * (1) The Minister must establish a list of biological agents that the Minister considers to be of security concern to Australia. The list is to be called the List of Securitysensitive Biological Agents.

    * (2) Without limiting subsection (1), the Minister may consider a biological agent to be of security concern to Australia if the biological agent could be developed, produced, stockpiled, acquired or retained in types and quantities that could allow the biological agent to be used as a weapon.

    * (3) If the Minister includes a toxin in the list, the Minister may also specify in the list a quantity (the **_reportable quantity_**) of that toxin.

    * (4) The list is not a legislative instrument.

##### 32  Variation of the List of Securitysensitive Biological Agents

    * (1) The Minister may, in writing, vary the List of Securitysensitive Biological Agents by:

     * (a) including a biological agent and, if applicable, a reportable quantity of that agent in the list if the Minister considers the biological agent to be of security concern to Australia; or

     * (b) removing a biological agent and, if applicable, a reportable quantity of that agent from the list if the Minister no longer considers the biological agent to be of security concern to Australia; or

     * (c) changing the reportable quantity of a biological agent in the list; or

     * (d) correcting an inaccuracy.

    * (2) An instrument varying the List of Securitysensitive Biological Agents is not a legislative instrument.

##### 33  Minister must obtain and have regard to expert advice

    * (1) The Minister must not include a biological agent, or a reportable quantity of a biological agent, in the List of Securitysensitive Biological Agents, or otherwise vary the list, unless:

     * (a) the Minister has obtained advice from:

      * (i) an agency or instrumentality of the Commonwealth that has responsibility for obtaining and assessing information about the risks and threats posed by biological agents that may be of security concern to Australia; and

      * (ii) persons with scientific or technical knowledge of biological agents that may be of security concern to Australia; and

     * (b) the Minister has sought advice from the States, the Australian Capital Territory and the Northern Territory.

    * (2) To avoid doubt, the persons referred to in subparagraph (1)(a)(ii) may be officers or employees of an agency or instrumentality of the Commonwealth referred to in subparagraph (1)(a)(i).

    * (3) The Minister must have regard to advice received under subsection (1).

##### 34  List to be available on the Department's website

    * The Secretary is to ensure that an uptodate copy of the List of Securitysensitive Biological Agents is available on the Department's website.

#### Division 3--Standards relating to securitysensitive biological agents

    * (1) The Minister may, by legislative instrument, determine standards (**_SSBA Standards_**) relating to securitysensitive biological agents and biological agents that are or have been suspected, on the basis of testing in a laboratory, of being securitysensitive biological agents.

        * Note 1: SSBA Standards must be complied with by certain entities that handle or dispose of biological agents suspected of being securitysensitive biological agents: see sections 38B and 38D.

        * Note 2: SSBA Standards must be complied with by entities that handle securitysensitive biological agents: see section 56.

    * (2) Without limiting subsection (1), a standard may set out requirements relating to any of the following:

     * (a) the storage of securitysensitive biological agents;

     * (b) the security status of individuals who are entitled to handle or dispose of securitysensitive biological agents;

     * (c) the transport of securitysensitive biological agents;

     * (d) the handling (including transport) of biological agents suspected, on the basis of testing in a laboratory, of being securitysensitive biological agents;

     * (e) the disposal of biological agents that are or have been suspected, on the basis of testing in a laboratory, of being securitysensitive biological agents.

    * (2A) An example of requirements relating to a matter described in paragraph (2)(b) is requirements for background checks of individuals to be conducted under the AusCheck scheme (within the meaning of the _AusCheck Act 2007_) for the purposes of determining whether they should be authorised to handle or dispose of securitysensitive biological agents.

    * (3) A standard may set out different requirements to be complied with in respect of different securitysensitive biological agents.

    * (3A) A standard may set out different requirements relating to a biological agent depending on whether the agent:

     * (a) is merely suspected by a specified entity, on the basis of testing in a laboratory, of being a securitysensitive biological agent; or

     * (b) is a securitysensitive biological agent (regardless of any entity's knowledge or ignorance of that fact); or

     * (c) is known by a specified entity to be a securitysensitive biological agent; or

     * (d) is known by a specified entity to be a securitysensitive biological agent and was previously suspected by a specified entity, on the basis of testing in a laboratory, of being a securitysensitive biological agent.

    * (4) The Minister must not determine a standard unless the standard has been developed in consultation with:

     * (a) persons with scientific or technical knowledge in relation to the security of biological agents; and

     * (b) the States, the Australian Capital Territory and the Northern Territory.

    * (5) Subsection (4) does not prevent the Minister from consulting any other person who the Minister considers may assist the Minister in developing a standard.
