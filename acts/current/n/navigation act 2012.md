##### 304  Civil penalty provisions contravened by employees, agents or officers

    * If an element of a civil penalty provision is done or omitted to be done by an employee, agent or officer of a body corporate acting within the actual or apparent scope of his or her employment, or within his or her actual or apparent authority, the element must also be attributed to the body corporate.
