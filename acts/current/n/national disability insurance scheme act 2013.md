### Part 2--Objects and principles

##### 3  Objects of Act

    * (1) The objects of this Act are to:

     * (a) in conjunction with other laws, give effect to Australia's obligations under the Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities done at New York on 13 December 2006 ([2008] ATS 12); and

     * (b) provide for the National Disability Insurance Scheme in Australia; and

     * (c) support the independence and social and economic participation of people with disability; and

     * (d) provide reasonable and necessary supports, including early intervention supports, for participants in the National Disability Insurance Scheme launch; and

     * (e) enable people with disability to exercise choice and control in the pursuit of their goals and the planning and delivery of their supports; and

     * (f) facilitate the development of a nationally consistent approach to the access to, and the planning and funding of, supports for people with disability; and

     * (g) promote the provision of high quality and innovative supports that enable people with disability to maximise independent lifestyles and full inclusion in the community; and

     * (h) raise community awareness of the issues that affect the social and economic participation of people with disability, and facilitate greater community inclusion of people with disability; and

     * (i) in conjunction with other laws, give effect to certain obligations that Australia has as a party to:

      * (i) the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights done at New York on 16 December 1966 ([1980] ATS 23); and

      * (ii) the International Covenant on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights done at New York on 16 December 1966 ([1976] ATS 5); and

      * (iii) the Convention on the Rights of the Child done at New York on 20 November 1989 ([1991] ATS 4); and

      * (v) the International Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Racial Discrimination done at New York on 21 December 1965 ([1975] ATS 40).

        * Note: In 2013, the text of a Convention or Covenant in the Australian Treaty Series was accessible through the Australian Treaties Library on the AustLII website (www.austlii.edu.au).

    * (2) These objects are to be achieved by:

     * (a) providing the foundation for governments to work together to develop and implement the National Disability Insurance Scheme launch; and

     * (b) adopting an insurancebased approach, informed by actuarial analysis, to the provision and funding of supports for people with disability.

    * (3) In giving effect to the objects of the Act, regard is to be had to:

     * (a) the progressive implementation of the National Disability Insurance Scheme; and

     * (b) the need to ensure the financial sustainability of the National Disability Insurance Scheme; and

     * (c) the broad context of disability reform provided for in:

      * (i) the National Disability Strategy 20102020 as endorsed by COAG on 13 February 2011; and

      * (ii) the _Carer Recognition Act 2010_; and

     * (d) the provision of services by other agencies, Departments or organisations and the need for interaction between the provision of mainstream services and the provision of supports under the National Disability Insurance Scheme.

##### 4  General principles guiding actions under this Act

    * (1) People with disability have the same right as other members of Australian society to realise their potential for physical, social, emotional and intellectual development.

    * (2) People with disability should be supported to participate in and contribute to social and economic life to the extent of their ability.

    * (3) People with disability and their families and carers should have certainty that people with disability will receive the care and support they need over their lifetime.

    * (4) People with disability should be supported to exercise choice, including in relation to taking reasonable risks, in the pursuit of their goals and the planning and delivery of their supports.

    * (5) People with disability should be supported to receive reasonable and necessary supports, including early intervention supports.

    * (6) People with disability have the same right as other members of Australian society to respect for their worth and dignity and to live free from abuse, neglect and exploitation.

    * (7) People with disability have the same right as other members of Australian society to pursue any grievance.

    * (8) People with disability have the same right as other members of Australian society to be able to determine their own best interests, including the right to exercise choice and control, and to engage as equal partners in decisions that will affect their lives, to the full extent of their capacity.

    * (9) People with disability should be supported in all their dealings and communications with the Agency so that their capacity to exercise choice and control is maximised in a way that is appropriate to their circumstances and cultural needs.

    * (10) People with disability should have their privacy and dignity respected.

    * (11) Reasonable and necessary supports for people with disability should:

     * (a) support people with disability to pursue their goals and maximise their independence; and

     * (b) support people with disability to live independently and to be included in the community as fully participating citizens; and

     * (c) develop and support the capacity of people with disability to undertake activities that enable them to participate in the community and in employment.

      * (i) has taken no action to claim or obtain the compensation; or

      * (ii) has taken no reasonable action to claim or obtain the compensation.

    * (2) The CEO may, by written notice, require the participant or prospective participant to take the action specified in the notice within the period specified in the notice. The action must be action that is reasonable to enable the person to claim or obtain the compensation.

    * (3) In considering whether it is reasonable to require a participant or prospective participant to take an action, the CEO must have regard to the following:

     * (a) the disability of the participant or prospective participant;

     * (b) the circumstances which give rise to the entitlement or possible entitlement to compensation;

    * (5) The period specified by the CEO must be a period of at least 28 days after the day on which the notice is given.

    * (5A) The CEO may, on application by the participant or prospective participant, extend the specified period.

    * (1) A participant or prospective participant who is given a notice under subsection 104(2) requiring him or her to take action (the **_required action_**) to claim or obtain compensation within a specified period must take the required action within the period.

     * (e) the impact (including any financial impact), of the CEO taking the action or taking over the conduct of the claim, on the participant or prospective participant and his or her family;

     * (f) any other matter the CEO considers relevant, having regard to the objects and principles set out in Part 2 of Chapter 1 of this Act.
