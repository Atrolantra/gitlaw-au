         * Note 1: The displacement provision is not covered by this subsection if subsection (4) applies to the displacement provision: if that subsection applies there would be no potential inconsistency to be dealt with by this subsection.

      * (c) on which the client in fact relied in good faith.

##### 75  Responsibility if representative of only one licensee

     * If the representative is the representative of only one licensee, the licensee is responsible, as between the licensee and the client, for the conduct of the representative, whether or not the representative's conduct is within the authority of the licensee.

##### 76  Representatives of multiple licensees

     * When this section applies

     * (1) This section applies if the representative is the representative of more than one licensee.

     * Conduct covered by only one authority

     * (2) If:

      * (a) the representative is the representative of one of the licensees only in relation to a particular class of credit activity; and

      * (b) the conduct relates to that class of credit activity;

     * that licensee is responsible for the conduct, as between that licensee and the client, whether or not the conduct is within the authority of the licensee.

     * Conduct covered by multiple authorities

     * (4) In any other case, all of the licensees are jointly and severally responsible for the conduct, as between themselves and the client, whether or not the representative's conduct is within the authority of any of them.

##### 77  Responsibility extends to loss or damage suffered by client

     * The responsibility of a licensee under this Division extends so as to make the licensee liable to the client in relation to any loss or damage suffered by the client as a result of the representative's conduct.

      * (b) provides for a licensee, for whom a representative acts, to indemnify another licensee for a liability in relation to the representative.

      * (e) any other matter prescribed by the regulations.

     * (3) ASIC must (subject to Part VIIC of the _Crimes Act 1914_), in considering whether it has reason it has reason to believe that a person referred to in subparagraph (2)(b)(ii) is not a fit and proper person to engage in credit activities, have regard to the matters set out in paragraphs (2)(a), (c), (d) and (e) in relation to the person.

     * (4) Despite subsection (1), ASIC may only make a banning order against a person after giving the person an opportunity:

      * (a) permanently; or

      * (b) for a specified period.

##### 83  Variation or cancellation of banning orders

     * (1) ASIC may vary or cancel a banning order if ASIC is satisfied that it is appropriate to do so because of a change in any of the circumstances based on which ASIC made the order.

     * (2) ASIC may do so:

      * (a) on its own initiative; or

      * (b) if the person against whom the order was made lodges with ASIC an application for the variation or cancellation.

     * (3) The application must be in the approved form.

     * (4) If ASIC proposes not to vary or cancel a banning order in accordance with an application given by a person under paragraph (2)(b), ASIC must give the person an opportunity:

      * (b) in the case of the variation of a banning order--set out a copy of the banning order as varied.

     * (4) However, if the banning order contains a provision of the kind referred to in subsection 81(3) and ASIC considers that the notice on its website would be unreasonably long if that provision were included, the notice may instead set out a summary of the provision's effect.

##### 85  Statement of reasons

     * (1) A copy of a banning order given to a person must be accompanied by a statement of reasons for the order.

### Part 64--Proceedings after an investigation

#### Division 1--Introduction

##### 273  Guide to this Part

     * This Part is about criminal and civil proceedings that ASIC may bring after it has conducted an investigation under this Chapter.

     * Division 2 deals with criminal proceedings. After an investigation of a person under this Chapter, ASIC may prosecute the person for an offence against the Commonwealth credit legislation (i.e. this Act or the National Credit Transitional Act). It may also require others to provide it with reasonable assistance in connection with the prosecution.

     * Division 2 also deals with civil proceedings. After an investigation of a person under this Chapter, ASIC may bring civil proceedings against a person in particular circumstances. However, under this Division, ASIC cannot bring civil proceedings under the Commonwealth credit legislation. This is because Part 42 (which deals with remedies) and the National Credit Code deal with when ASIC can bring those proceedings.

      * (a) as a result of an investigation; or

     * (2) ASIC may cause a prosecution of the person for the offence to be brought and carried on.

     * (3) ASIC may make a requirement under subsection (4) if:

      * (a) ASIC, on reasonable grounds, suspects or believes that a person can give information relevant to a prosecution for the offence; or

      * (b) the offence relates to matters being, or connected with, affairs of a licensee, credit representative or other person who engages, or has engaged, in a credit activity, or to matters including such matters.

     * (4) ASIC may, whether before or after a prosecution for the offence is begun, by writing given to any of the following persons:

      * (a) the person referred to in paragraph (3)(a);

      * (b) a representative, banker, lawyer or auditor of a person referred to in paragraph (3)(b);

     * require the person to give all reasonable assistance in connection with such a prosecution.

         * Note: Failure to comply with a requirement made under this subsection is an offence (see section 290).

     * (5) An offence under subsection 290(2) relating to subsection (4) of this section is an offence of strict liability.

     * (6) Subsection (4) does not apply in relation to:

      * (a) the person referred to in subsection (1); or

      * (b) a person who is or has been that person's lawyer.

         * Note: A defendant bears an evidential burden in relation to the matter in subsection (6), see subsection 13.3(3) of the _Criminal Code_.

     * (7) A requirement made by ASIC under subsection (4) is not a legislative instrument.

     * (8) Nothing in this section affects the operation of the _Director of Public Prosecutions Act 1983_.

##### 275  ASIC may bring civil proceedings

     * If, as a result of an investigation or from a record of an examination (being an investigation or examination conducted under this Chapter), it appears to ASIC to be in the public interest for a person to bring and carry on proceedings (other than proceedings under the Commonwealth credit legislation) for:

      * (a) the recovery of damages for fraud, negligence, default, breach of duty, or other misconduct, committed in connection with a matter to which the investigation or examination related; or

      * (b) recovery of property of the person;

     * ASIC: 

      * (c) if the person is a company (within the meaning of the _Corporations Act 2001_)--may cause; or

      * (d) otherwise--may, with the person's written consent, cause;

     * such proceedings to be begun and carried on in the person's name.

     * Credit without express prior agreement

     * (4) This Code does not apply to the provision of credit if, before the credit was provided, there was no express agreement between the credit provider and the debtor for the provision of credit.

     * (9) This Code does not apply to the provision of credit on the security of pawned or pledged goods by a pawnbroker in the ordinary course of a pawnbroker's business (being a business which is being lawfully conducted by the pawnbroker) as long as it is the case that, if the debtor is in default, the pawnbroker's only recourse is against the goods provided as security for the provision of the credit. However, sections 76 to 81 (Court may reopen unjust transactions) apply to any such provision of credit.

     * Trustees of estates

     * (10) This Code does not apply to the provision of credit by the trustee of the estate of a deceased person by way of an advance to a beneficiary or prospective beneficiary of the estate. However, sections 76 to 81 (Court may reopen unjust transactions) apply to any such provision of credit.

However, for a credit provider that provides credit to which this Code applies in the course of a business of providing credit to which this Code applies to employees or former employees and to others, this subsection applies only to the provision of credit on terms that are more favourable to the debtor than the terms on which the credit provider provides credit to persons who are not employees or former employees of the credit provider or a related body corporate.

     * Margin loans

     * (12) This Code does not apply to the provision of credit by way of a margin loan (within the meaning of subsection 761EA(1) of the _Corporations Act 2001_).

##### 9  Goods leases with option to purchase to be regarded as sale by instalments

     * (1) For the purposes of this Code, a contract for the hire of goods under which the hirer has a right or obligation to purchase the goods, is to be regarded as a sale of the goods by instalments if the charge that is or may be made for hiring the goods, together with any other amount payable under the contract (including an amount to purchase the goods or to exercise an option to do so) exceeds the cash price of the goods.

         * Note: A contract includes a series of contracts, or contracts and arrangements (see Part 13).

     * (2) A debt is to be regarded as having been incurred, and credit provided, in such circumstances.

     * (3) Accordingly, if because of subsection 5(1) the contract is a credit contract, this Code (including Part 6) applies as if the contract had always been a sale of goods by instalments, and for that purpose:

      * (c) the debtor is the person who is to make those payments; and

      * (d) the property of the supplier in the goods passes under the contract to the person to whom the goods are hired on delivery of the goods or the making of the contract, whichever occurs last; and

      * (e) the charge for providing the credit is the amount by which the charge that is or may be made for hiring the goods, together with any other amount payable under the contract (including an amount to purchase the goods or to exercise an option to do so), exceeds the cash price of the goods; and

      * (f) a mortgage containing the terms and conditions set out in the regulations is taken to have been entered into in writing between the person to whom the goods are hired under the contract and the supplier as security for payment to the supplier of the amount payable to the supplier by the person to whom the goods are hired under the contract; and

      * (g) any provision in the contract for hiring by virtue of which the supplier is empowered to take possession, or dispose, of the goods to which the contract relates is void.

     * (4) For the purposes of this section, the amount payable under the contract includes any agreed or residual value of the goods at the end of the hire period or on termination of the contract, but does not include the following amounts:

      * (a) any amount payable in respect of services that are incidental to the hire of goods under the contract;

      * (b) any amount that ceases to be payable on the termination of the contract following the exercise of a right of cancellation by the hirer at the earliest opportunity.

     * (3) However, the declaration is ineffective if, when the declaration was made, the credit provider or a person (the **_prescribed person_**) of a kind prescribed by the regulations:

      * (a) knew, or had reason to believe; or

      * (b) would have known, or had reason to believe, if the credit provider or prescribed person had made reasonable inquiries about the purpose for which the credit was provided, or intended to be provided, under the contract;

       * Criminal penalty: 50 penalty units.

##### 32B  Calculation of annual cost rate

     * (1) The annual cost rate of a credit contract must be calculated as a nominal rate per annum, together with the compounding frequency, using the formula:

     * where: 

     * **_n _**is the number of repayments per annum to be made under the credit contract (annualised if the term of the contract is less than 12 months), except that:

      * (a) if repayments are to be made weekly--**_n_** is 52.18; and

      * (b) if repayments are to be made fortnightly--**_n_** is 26.09; and

      * (c) if the contract does not provide for a constant interval between repayments--**_n_** is to be derived from the interval selected for the purposes of the definition of **_j_** in subsection (2).

     * **_r_** is the solution of the equation specified in subsection (2).

     * (2) The equation for the purposes of the definition of **_r_** in subsection (1) is:

     * where: 

     * **_Aj_** is the amount of credit to be provided under the credit contract at time **_j_** (the value of **_j_** for the provision of the first amount of credit is taken to be zero).

     * **_Cj_** is the credit cost amount (if any) for the credit contract that is payable by the debtor at time **_j_** in addition to the repayments **_Rj_**.

     * **_F_** is:

      * (a) if the credit contract is a medium amount credit contract--$400 (or such other amount as is prescribed by the regulations); or

      * (b) if the credit contract is not a medium amount credit contract and an amount is prescribed by the regulations in relation to the contract--that amount; or

      * (c) otherwise--$0.

     * **_j_** is the time, measured as a multiple (not necessarily integral) of:

      * (a) if the credit contract does not provide for a constant interval between contractual repayments--an interval of any kind selected by the credit provider as the unit of time; or

      * (b) otherwise--the interval between contractual repayments that will have elapsed since the first amount of credit is provided under the credit contract.

     * **_Rj_** is the repayment to be made at time**_ j_**.

     * **_t_** is the time, measured as a multiple of the interval between contractual repayments (or other interval so selected), that will elapse between:

      * (a) the time when the first amount of credit is provided under the credit contract; and

      * (b) the time when the last repayment is to be made under the contract.

     * Credit cost amount

     * (3) The **_credit cost amount_** for the credit contract is the sum of the following amounts if they are ascertainable:

      * (a) the amount of credit fees and charges payable in relation to the contract;

      * (b) the amount of a fee or charge payable by the debtor (whether or not payable under the contract) to:

       * (i) any person (whether or not associated with the credit provider) for an introduction to the credit provider; or

       * (ii) any person (whether or not associated with the credit provider) for any service if the person has been introduced to the debtor by the credit provider; or

       * (iii) the credit provider for any service relating to the provision of credit, other than a service referred to in subparagraph (ii);

      * (c) any other amount prescribed by the regulations.

     * (4) For the purposes of subsection (3), the amounts referred to in that subsection:

      * (a) include an amount that is payable even if the credit is not provided; but

      * (b) do not include an amount of a government fee, charge or duty payable in relation to the credit contract.

     * (4A) Despite subsection (3), the regulations may provide that a specified amount, or an amount included in a specified class, is not an amount referred to in paragraph (3)(a) or (b).

     * Tolerances and assumptions etc.

     * (5) The annual cost rate must be correct to at least the nearest one hundredth of 1% per annum.

     * (6) In calculating the annual cost rate, reasonable approximations may be made if it would be impractical or unreasonably onerous to make a precise calculation.

         * Example: If repayments are to be made on a fixed day each month, it may be assumed that repayments will be made on that day each month even though the credit contract provides for payment on the preceding or succeeding business day when the due date is not a business day.

     * (7) The tolerances and assumptions under sections 180 to 182 apply to the calculation of the annual cost rate.

     * Continuing credit contracts

     * (8) If the credit contract is a continuing credit contract, the following assumptions also apply to the calculation of the annual cost rate of the contract:

      * (a) that the debtor has drawn down the maximum amount of credit that the credit provider has agreed to provide under the contract;

      * (b) that the debtor will pay the minimum repayments specified in the contract;

      * (c) if credit is provided in respect of payment by the credit provider to a third person in relation to goods or services or cash supplied by that third person to the debtor from time to time--that the debtor will not be supplied with any further goods or services or cash;

      * (d) if credit is provided in respect of cash supplied by the credit provider to the debtor from time to time--that the debtor will not be supplied with any further cash.

     * the debtor or mortgagor may give written notice of an intention to return the goods to the credit provider or, if the goods are in the credit provider's possession, require the credit provider in writing to sell the goods.

     * Delivery of goods

     * (2) A debtor or mortgagor may return the goods to the credit provider at the credit provider's place of business during ordinary business hours within 7 days of the date of the notice or within such other period or at such other time or place as may be agreed with the credit provider.

     * (3) The credit provider must, within 14 days after a debtor or mortgagor returns the goods or requires the credit provider to sell the goods, give the debtor or mortgagor a written notice containing the estimated value of the goods and any other information required by the regulations.

     * Return or sale of goods

     * (4) If the debtor or mortgagor, within 21 days after the notice under subsection (3) is given, requests by written notice return of the goods to the debtor or mortgagor or withdraws the requirement to sell the goods (and the debtor is not in default under the terms of the credit contract), the credit provider must return to the debtor or mortgagor any goods returned by the debtor or mortgagor and must not comply with the requirement.

     * Nominated purchaser

     * (5) The debtor or mortgagor may, within 21 days after the notice under subsection (3) is given, nominate in writing a person who is prepared to purchase the goods from the credit provider at the estimated value or at any greater amount for which the credit provider has obtained a written offer to buy the goods. The credit provider must offer to sell the goods to that person for the estimated value or, if there is a written offer to buy the goods for a greater amount, that amount.

     * Sale of goods by credit provider

     * (6) The credit provider must, if the goods are not required to be returned under subsection (4), as soon as reasonably practicable (or at such other time as the credit provider and the debtor or mortgagor agree) sell the goods in accordance with subsection (5) or, if no buyer is nominated or the nominated buyer under that subsection does not buy the goods, for the best price reasonably obtainable.

     * Amount to be credited to debtor or mortgagor

     * (7) The credit provider must credit the debtor or mortgagor with a payment equivalent to the proceeds of the sale less any amounts which the credit provider is entitled to deduct from those proceeds. On the sale of the goods, the amount required to pay out the contract becomes due.

     * Deductions from proceeds

     * (8) A credit provider that sells mortgaged goods under this section is entitled to deduct from the proceeds of that sale only the following amounts:

      * (a) the amount currently secured by the mortgage in relation to the credit contract or guarantee, not being more than the amount required to discharge the contract or guarantee;

      * (b) the amount payable to discharge any prior mortgage to which the goods were subject;

      * (c) the amounts payable in successive discharge of any subsequent mortgages to which the goods were subject and of which the credit provider had notice;

      * (d) the credit provider's reasonable enforcement expenses;

      * (e) the expenses reasonably incurred by the credit provider in connection with the possession and sale of the mortgaged goods.

     * Notice of amount credited and other matters

         * Note: For strict liability, see section 6.1 of the _Criminal Code_.

##### 86  Compensation to debtor or mortgagor

     * (1) The court, on application by the debtor or mortgagor, may order a credit provider to credit the debtor or mortgagor with a payment, fixed by the court, exceeding the net proceeds of sale if it is not satisfied that the credit provider sold the goods as soon as reasonably practicable (or at such other time as the credit provider and debtor or mortgagor agreed) for the best price reasonably obtainable.

     * (2) On application by the debtor or mortgagor, the mortgagee under any prior mortgage to which the goods are subject or the mortgagee under any subsequent mortgage of which the credit provider has notice, the court, if not satisfied that the credit provider complied with section 85, may make an order requiring the credit provider to compensate the debtor or mortgagor or the relevant mortgagee for any loss suffered as a result.

     * (3) The onus of proving that section 85 was complied with is on the credit provider.

##### Subdivision B--Ending of reverse mortgage by credit provider receiving value of reverse mortgaged property

##### 86A  Application of this Subdivision

     * (1) This Subdivision applies in relation to a credit contract for a reverse mortgage and a mortgage securing the debtor's obligations under the contract if:

      * (a) the debtor's accrued liability (whether or not due and payable) under the contract is more than the amount (the **_adjusted market value_**) worked out under subsection (2) for the reverse mortgaged property; and

      * (b) the credit provider receives an amount at least equal to the adjusted market value for the reverse mortgaged property either:

       * (i) as a payment accepted from the debtor under the credit contract; or

       * (ii) as proceeds of the sale by the credit provider of the reverse mortgaged property.

     * (2) The adjusted market value for the reverse mortgaged property is the amount worked out by:

      * (a) working out the market value of the property in accordance with the regulations (if any); and

      * (b) adjusting that value in accordance with the regulations (if any).

     * Regulations for the purposes of paragraph (b) may prescribe different adjustments to be made in different circumstances.

##### 86B  Discharge of debtor's obligations under credit contract and discharge of mortgage

     * (1) The debtor's obligations under the credit contract are discharged by force of this subsection.

     * (2) The mortgage securing those obligations is discharged by force of this subsection.

         * Note 2: This section does not apply in some cases: see section 86E.

     * (2) To avoid doubt, subsection (1) does not apply to the payment (if any) that is described in subparagraph 86A(1)(b)(i) and caused this Subdivision to apply.

##### 86E  Cases in which sections 86B, 86C and 86D do not apply

     * Sections 86B, 86C and 86D do not apply if:

      * (b) the debtor engaged in fraud, or made a misrepresentation, relating to the reverse mortgage before, at or after the time the credit contract was made; or

#### Division 2--Enforcement of credit contracts, mortgages and guarantees

##### 88  Requirements to be met before credit provider can enforce credit contract or mortgage against defaulting debtor or mortgagor

     * Enforcement of credit contract

     * (1) A credit provider must not begin enforcement proceedings against a debtor in relation to a credit contract unless:

      * (a) the debtor is in default under the credit contract; and

      * (b) the credit provider has given the debtor, and any guarantor, a default notice, complying with this section, allowing the debtor a period of at least 30 days from the date of the notice to remedy the default; and

      * (c) the default has not been remedied within that period; and

      * (d) if the credit contract is for a reverse mortgage, the credit provider has spoken to one of the following persons by telephone or in person in that period and has thus both confirmed that the debtor received the default notice and informed the person of the consequences of failure to remedy the default, or has made reasonable efforts to do so:

       * (i) the debtor;

       * (ii) a practising lawyer representing the debtor;

       * (iii) a person with a power of attorney relating to the debtor's financial affairs.

       * Criminal penalty: 50 penalty units.

         * Note: If a debtor or guarantor has given a credit provider a hardship notice or a postponement request there may be extra requirements that the credit provider must comply with before beginning enforcement proceedings: see sections 89A and 94.

     * Enforcement of mortgage

     * (2) A credit provider must not begin enforcement proceedings against a mortgagor to recover payment of money due or take possession of, sell, appoint a receiver for or foreclose in relation to property subject to a mortgage, unless:

      * (a) the mortgagor is in default under the mortgage; and

      * (b) the credit provider has given the mortgagor a default notice, complying with this section, allowing the mortgagor a period of at least 30 days from the date of the notice to remedy the default; and

      * (c) the default has not been remedied within that period.

      * (d) if the mortgage secures an obligation under a credit contract for a reverse mortgage, the credit provider has spoken to one of the following persons by telephone or in person in that period and has thus both confirmed that the mortgagor received the default notice and informed the person of the consequences of failure to remedy the default, or has made reasonable efforts to do so:

       * (i) the mortgagor;

       * (ii) a practising lawyer representing the mortgagor;

       * (iii) a person with a power of attorney relating to the mortgagor's financial affairs.

       * Criminal penalty: 50 penalty units.

         * Note: If a mortgagor has given a credit provider a postponement request there may be extra requirements that the credit provider must comply with before beginning enforcement proceedings: see section 94.

     * Default notice requirements

     * (3) A default notice must contain a prominent heading at its top stating that it is a default notice and specify:

      * (a) the default; and

      * (b) the action necessary to remedy the default; and

      * (c) a period for remedying the default; and

      * (d) the date after which enforcement proceedings in relation to the default, and, if relevant, repossession of mortgaged property may begin if the default has not been remedied; and

      * (e) that repossession and sale of mortgaged property may not extinguish the debtor's liability; and

      * (f) the information prescribed by the regulations about the debtor's right to:

       * (i) give a hardship notice under section 72; or

       * (ii) give a postponement request under section 94; or

       * (iii) make an application to the court under sections 74 and 96; and

      * (g) the information prescribed by the regulations about:

       * (i) the approved external dispute resolution scheme of which the credit provider is a member; and

       * (ii) the debtor's rights under that scheme; and

      * (h) that a subsequent default of the same kind that occurs during the period specified for remedying the original default may be the subject of enforcement proceedings without further notice if it is not remedied within the period; and

      * (i) that, under the _Privacy Act 1988_, a credit reporting body (within the meaning of that Act) may collect and hold default information (within the meaning of that Act) in relation to the default; and

      * (j) any other information prescribed by the regulations.

     * Combined notices

     * (4) Default notices that may be given under subsections (1) and (2) may be combined in one document if given to a person who is both a debtor and a mortgagor.

     * When default notice not required

     * (5) A credit provider is not required to give a default notice or to wait until the period specified in the default notice has elapsed, before beginning enforcement proceedings, if:

      * (a) the credit provider reasonably believes that it was induced by fraud on the part of the debtor or mortgagor to enter into the credit contract or mortgage; or

      * (b) the credit provider has made reasonable attempts to locate the debtor or mortgagor but without success; or

      * (c) the court authorises the credit provider to begin the enforcement proceedings; or

      * (d) the credit provider reasonably believes that the debtor or mortgagor has removed or disposed of mortgaged goods under a mortgage related to the credit contract or under the mortgage concerned, or intends to remove or dispose of mortgaged goods, without the credit provider's permission or that urgent action is necessary to protect the mortgaged property.

     * Nonremedial default

     * (6) If the credit provider reasonably believes that a default is not capable of being remedied:

      * (a) the default notice need only specify the default; and

      * (b) the credit provider may begin the enforcement proceedings after the period of 30 days from the date of the notice.

     * (7) Subsections (1) and (2) are offences of strict liability.

         * Note: For strict liability, see section 6.1 of the _Criminal Code_.

     * Some defaults are not a basis for a default notice

     * (7A) So far as a notice purporting to be a default notice relates to an alleged default under a credit contract for a reverse mortgage that is an event described in subsection 18A(3), the notice is not a default notice for the purposes of any of the following provisions:

      * (a) subsections (1) and (2) of this section;

      * (b) section 93.

         * Note: This has the effect that:

          * (a) if the credit provider begins enforcement proceedings relating to the alleged default the credit provider will contravene subsection (1) or (2) of this section (unless subsection (5) of this section applies); and

          * (b) section 93 will affect the operation of an acceleration clause on the basis of the alleged default.

     * (7B) To avoid doubt, subsection (7A) does not affect the status of the notice as a default notice for the purposes of section 89, 94 or 95.

     * Other law about mortgages not affected

     * (8) This section is in addition to any provision of any other law relating to the enforcement of real property or other mortgages and does not prevent the issue of notices to defaulting mortgagors under other legislation. Nothing in this section prevents a notice to a defaulting mortgagor under other legislation being issued at the same time, or in the same document, as the default notice under this section.

         * Note: By virtue of subsection 183(2), a notice may contain information required to be given under other legislation or be included in a notice given under other legislation.

##### 89  Defaults may be remedied

     * (1) If a default notice under section 88 states that the credit provider intends to take action because the debtor or mortgagor is in default under the credit contract or mortgage, the debtor, mortgagor or guarantor may remedy the default within the period specified in the notice, and the contract or mortgage is then reinstated and any acceleration clause cannot operate.

     * (2) A debtor, mortgagor or guarantor does not remedy the default if, at the end of the period, the debtor or mortgagor is in default under the credit contract or mortgage because of the breach specified in the notice or because of a subsequent breach of the same type.

##### 89A  Effect of hardship notices on enforcement

     * (1) This section applies if:

      * (a) a credit provider is required to give a default notice under section 88 before beginning enforcement proceedings; and

      * (b) before or after the credit provider gives the default notice, the debtor gives the credit provider a hardship notice (the **_current hardship notice_**) under section 72; and

      * (c) either:

       * (i) in the 4 months before the day the current hardship notice is given, the debtor had not given the credit provider another hardship notice; or

       * (ii) in that 4month period, the debtor had given the credit provider one or more other hardship notices, but the credit provider reasonably believes that the basis on which the current hardship notice was given is materially different from the bases on which the other hardship notices were given.

     * (2) The credit provider must not begin enforcement proceedings against the debtor unless:

      * (a) the credit provider has given the debtor a notice under paragraph 72(4)(b), in response to the current hardship notice, stating that the credit provider and debtor have not agreed to change the credit contract; and

      * (b) the period of 14 days, starting on the day the credit provider gives the notice under paragraph 72(4)(b), has expired.

       * Criminal penalty: 50 penalty units.

         * Note: The credit provider must allow the debtor at least 30 days from the date of the default notice to remedy the default--see section 88. The 14day period in subsection (2) may end before, at the same time as, or after the end of the period for remedying the default specified in the default notice.

     * (3) However, the credit provider may take possession of mortgaged goods if the credit provider reasonably believes that:

      * (a) the debtor or mortgagor has removed or disposed of the mortgaged goods, or intends to remove or dispose of them, without the credit provider's permission; or

      * (b) urgent action is necessary to protect the goods.

     * (4) Subsection (2) is an offence of strict liability.

         * Note: For strict liability, see section 6.1 of the _Criminal Code_.

##### 90  Requirements to be met before credit provider can enforce guarantee against guarantor

     * (1) A credit provider must not, under a guarantee, enforce a judgment against a guarantor unless:

      * (a) the credit provider has obtained a judgment against the debtor for payment of the guaranteed liability and the judgment remains unsatisfied for 30 days after the credit provider has made a written demand for payment of the judgment debt; or

      * (b) the court has relieved the credit provider from the obligation to obtain a judgment against the debtor on the ground that recovery from the debtor is unlikely; or

      * (c) the credit provider has made reasonable attempts to locate the debtor but without success; or

      * (d) the debtor is insolvent.

       * Criminal penalty: 50 penalty units.

     * (2) Subsection (1) is an offence of strict liability.

         * Note: For strict liability, see section 6.1 of the _Criminal Code_.

##### 91  Requirements to be met before credit provider can repossess mortgaged goods

     * (1) A credit provider must not, without the consent of the court, take possession of mortgaged goods if the amount currently owing under the credit contract related to the relevant mortgage is less than 25% of the amount of credit provided under the contract or $10,000, whichever is the lesser.

       * Criminal penalty: 100 penalty units.

     * (2) However, the restriction does not apply:

      * (a) to a continuing credit contract; or

      * (b) if the credit provider believes on reasonable grounds that the debtor has removed or disposed of the mortgaged goods, or intends to remove or dispose of them, without the credit provider's permission or that urgent action is necessary to protect the goods.

     * (3) Subsection (1) is an offence of strict liability.

         * Note: For strict liability, see section 6.1 of the _Criminal Code_.

     * (4) In any proceedings in which it is established that a credit provider has taken possession of mortgaged goods contrary to subsection (1), the burden of establishing that the possession of the goods was lawfully taken by virtue of subsection (2) lies on the credit provider.

     * (5) Nothing in this section prevents a credit provider from accepting the return of goods under section 85.

##### 93  Requirements to be met before credit provider can enforce an acceleration clause

     * (1) An acceleration clause is to operate only if the debtor or mortgagor is in default under the credit contract or mortgage and:

      * (a) the credit provider has given to the debtor and any guarantor, or to the mortgagor, a default notice under section 88; and

      * (b) the default notice contains an additional statement of the manner in which the liabilities of the debtor or mortgagor under the contract or mortgage would be affected by the operation of the acceleration clause and also of the amount required to pay out the contract (as accelerated); and

      * (c) the default has not been remedied within the period specified in the default notice (unless the credit provider reasonably believes that the default is not capable of being remedied).

     * (2) However, a credit provider is not required to give a default notice under section 88 or to wait until the period specified in the default notice has elapsed before bringing an acceleration clause into operation, if:

      * (a) the credit provider reasonably believes that it was induced by fraud on the part of the debtor or mortgagor to enter into the contract or mortgage; or

      * (b) the credit provider has made reasonable attempts to locate the debtor or mortgagor but without success; or

      * (c) the court authorises the credit provider not to do so; or

      * (d) the credit provider reasonably believes that the debtor or mortgagor has removed or disposed of mortgaged goods under a mortgage related to the credit contract or the mortgage concerned, or intends to remove or dispose of mortgaged goods, without the credit provider's permission or that urgent action is necessary to protect the goods.

     * (3) This section is in addition to any provision of any other law relating to the enforcement of real property mortgages and does not prevent the issue of notices to defaulting mortgagors under other legislation.

##### 93A  Extra requirements for enforcing reverse mortgage if debtor's liability exceeded value of reverse mortgaged property

     * (1) This section applies in relation to a credit contract for a reverse mortgage and a mortgage securing the debtor's obligations under the contract if:

      * (a) Subdivision B of Division 1 applies in relation to the contract and the mortgage (see section 86A); and

      * (b) just before the amount was received by the credit provider as described in paragraph 86A(1)(b), the debtor's accrued liability described in paragraph 86A(1)(a) exceeded that amount; and

      * (c) one or more of the conditions in section 86E are met (so that sections 86B, 86C and 86D do not apply).

     * (2) If section 88 requires the credit provider to give the debtor or mortgagor a default notice before beginning enforcement proceedings to recover any of the excess, the credit provider must not begin them unless:

      * (a) the default notice given to the debtor or mortgagor specifies:

       * (i) the amount received by the credit provider; and

       * (ii) the debtor's accrued liability just before that amount was received; and

       * (iii) the conditions in section 86E that are met; and

      * (b) if the credit provider knows of a practising lawyer acting for the debtor or mortgagor and the credit provider gave the debtor or mortgagor the default notice by means other than giving it to the lawyer--the credit provider has given the lawyer a copy of the default notice at the same time as, or as soon as practicable after, giving the debtor or mortgagor the notice.

       * Criminal penalty: 50 penalty units.

#### Division 3--Postponement of enforcement proceedings

##### 94  Postponement of exercise of rights

     * Postponement request

     * (1) A debtor, mortgagor or guarantor who has been given a default notice under section 88 or a demand for payment under section 90 may, at any time before the end of the period specified in the notice or demand, request (a **_postponement request_**), orally or in writing, that the credit provider negotiate a postponement of:

      * (a) the enforcement proceedings; or

      * (b) any action taken under such proceedings; or

      * (c) the operation of any applicable acceleration clause.

     * Credit provider's notice about postponement

     * (2) If the debtor, mortgagor or guarantor gives the postponement request, the credit provider must, within 21 days after the day of receiving the request, give the person a written notice:

      * (a) that states whether or not the credit provider agrees to negotiate a postponement; and

      * (b) if the credit provider does not agree to negotiate--that states:

       * (i) the name of the approved external dispute resolution scheme of which the credit provider is a member; and

       * (ii) the person's rights under that scheme; and

       * (iii) the reasons for not agreeing to negotiate.

       * Criminal penalty: 30 penalty units.

     * Enforcement proceedings

     * (3) If the debtor, mortgagor or guarantor gives the postponement request, the credit provider must not begin enforcement proceedings unless:

      * (a) the credit provider has given the debtor, mortgagor or guarantor a notice under subsection (2) in response to the postponement request; and

      * (b) the period of 14 days, starting on the day the credit provider gives the notice under subsection (2), has expired.

       * Criminal penalty: 50 penalty units.

         * Note: The credit provider must allow the debtor or mortgagor at least 30 days from the date of the default notice to remedy the default--see section 88. The 14day period in subsection (3) may end before, at the same time as, or after the end of the period for remedying the default specified in the default notice.

     * (4) However, the credit provider may take possession of mortgaged goods if the credit provider reasonably believes that:

      * (a) the debtor or mortgagor has removed or disposed of the mortgaged goods, or intends to remove or dispose of them, without the credit provider's permission; or

      * (b) urgent action is necessary to protect the goods.

     * (5) Subsections (2) and (3) are offences of strict liability.

         * Note: For strict liability, see section 6.1 of the _Criminal Code_.

##### 95  Effect of negotiated postponement

     * (1) A default notice under section 88 or a demand for payment under section 90 is taken, for the purposes of this Code, not to have been given or made if a postponement is negotiated with the credit provider and the debtor, mortgagor or guarantor complies with the conditions of postponement.

     * (2) It is a condition of any postponement negotiated with a credit provider after the credit provider has taken possession of property subject to a mortgage that the mortgagor pay the reasonable costs of the credit provider in taking possession of the property.

     * (3) A credit provider must give written notice of the conditions of a postponement referred to in subsection (1) not later than 30 days after agreement is reached on the postponement. The notice must set out the consequences under subsection (6) if the conditions of the postponement are not complied with.

       * Criminal penalty: 100 penalty units.

     * (4) Subsection (3) is an offence of strict liability.

         * Note: For strict liability, see section 6.1 of the _Criminal Code_.

However, the court is to have regard to that prudential standing only if the credit provider requests the court to do so.

      * (d) when the credit provider first became aware, or ought reasonably to have become aware, of the contravention;

     * (5) The court must, for the purposes of determining an application for an order under this Division or the amount of a penalty, treat a contravention of a key requirement that occurs merely because of another contravention of a key requirement as being a contravention of the same kind. If a provision referred to in section 111 contains several requirements, the court must treat contraventions of more than one of those requirements as a single contravention of the one key requirement for the purposes of determining the amount of a penalty.

     * Suppression of publication of application

     * (6) The court may, if it thinks it appropriate in the circumstances, order that particulars of or any matters relating to an application for an order under this Division not be published.

     * (3) For the purposes of paragraph (1)(a), the amount of future interest charges payable under a credit contract is to be calculated on the assumptions in sections 180 and 182.

##### 115  Payment of penalty to debtor or guarantor

     * (1) An amount of penalty ordered by the court to be paid on an application for an order made by a debtor or a guarantor may be set off by the debtor or guarantor against any amount that is due or becomes due to the credit provider under the credit contract.

##### 117  Payment of penalty

     * An amount of penalty ordered by the court to be paid on an application for an order made by a credit provider or ASIC must be paid by the credit provider to ASIC on behalf of the Commonwealth.
