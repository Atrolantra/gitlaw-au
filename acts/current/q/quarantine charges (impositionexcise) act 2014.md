    * (1) This Act does not impose a tax on property of any kind belonging to a State.

    * (2) In this section:

    * **_property of any kind belonging to a State_** has the same meaning as in section 114 of the Constitution.

### Part 2--Charges

##### 6  Imposition of charges

    * (1) A regulation may prescribe a charge in relation to a prescribed matter connected with the administration of the _Quarantine Act 1908_.

    * (2) The charges prescribed under subsection (1) are imposed, and are so imposed as taxes.

    * (3) Two or more charges may be prescribed in relation to the same matter, and a single charge may be prescribed in relation to 2 or more matters.

    * (4) This section imposes a charge only so far as that charge is a duty of excise within the meaning of section 55 of the Constitution.

##### 7  Matters relating to amount of charges

    * (1) A regulation may prescribe a charge under subsection 6(1):

     * (a) by specifying an amount as the charge; or

     * (b) by specifying a method for calculating the amount of the charge.

    * (2) Before the GovernorGeneral makes a regulation under subsection 6(1) prescribing a charge in relation to a matter, the Minister must be satisfied that the amount of the charge is set at a level that is designed to recover no more than the Commonwealth's likely costs in connection with the matter.

##### 8  Who is liable to pay charges

##### 9  Exemptions from charges

### Part 3--Validation

##### 10  Validation of fees charged under the Quarantine Act 1908

    * (1) This section applies to each amount of a fee (including a booking fee or a late payment fee) that a section 86E determination purported to require a person to pay in relation to a matter, to the extent that the determination could not validly require the fee to be paid in relation to the matter.

    * (2) By force of this section, a charge of an equal amount is taken to have been imposed on the person in relation to the matter, and to have been so imposed as a tax.

    * (3) The amount of the charge for which the person is liable is:

     * (a) reduced by:

      * (i) the sum of any amounts paid by the person on account of the purported fee and not subsequently refunded under the _Quarantine Act 1908_; and

      * (ii) the sum of any amounts subsequently refunded to the person under that Act in respect of the purported fee; and

      * (iii) the sum of any amounts remitted under that Act in respect of the purported fee; and

     * (b) increased by so much of the sum of the amounts paid by the person on account of the purported fee as the person recovers from the Commonwealth.

       * Note: For matters related to the collection of charges that are taken to have been imposed by this section, see section 42 of the _Quarantine Charges (Collection) Act 2014_.

    * (4) A charge is taken to have been imposed by this section only so far as the charge would be a duty of excise within the meaning of section 55 of the Constitution.

    * (5) In this section:

    * **_section 86E determination_** means a determination made under section 86E of the _Quarantine Act 1908_ (as that section was in force at any time before the commencement of this section).

### Part 4--Miscellaneous

##### 11  Regulations

    * The GovernorGeneral may make regulations prescribing matters: 

     * (a) required or permitted by this Act to be prescribed; or

     * (b) necessary or convenient to be prescribed for carrying out or giving effect to this Act.
