##### 16  Creation of charge on goods

    * (1) This section applies in relation to goods if:

     * (a) the owner of the goods is liable to pay a quarantine charge or a late payment fee (whether or not the charge or fee relates to the goods); and

    * (2) Subsection 73(2) of the _Personal Property Securities Act 2009_ applies to the charge.

       * Note: The effect of this subsection is that the priority between the Commonwealth's charge and a security interest in the goods to which the _Personal Property Securities Act 2009_ applies is to be determined in accordance with this Act rather than the _Personal Property Securities Act 2009_.

       * Note: The effect of this subsection is that the priority between the Commonwealth's charge and a security interest in the vessel to which the _Personal Property Securities Act 2009_ applies is to be determined in accordance with this Act rather than the _Personal Property Securities Act 2009_.
