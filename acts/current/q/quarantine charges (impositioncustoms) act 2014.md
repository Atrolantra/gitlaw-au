      * (iii) the sum of any amounts remitted under that Act in respect of the purported fee; and

       * Note: For matters related to the collection of charges that are taken to have been imposed by this section, see section 42 of the _Quarantine Charges (Collection) Act 2014_.

    * (4) A charge is taken to have been imposed by this section only so far as the charge would be a duty of customs within the meaning of section 55 of the Constitution.
