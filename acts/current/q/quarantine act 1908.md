### An Act relating to Quarantine

### Part I--Introductory

##### 1  Short title

    * This Act may be cited as the _Quarantine Act 1908_.

##### 2  Commencement

    * This Act shall commence on a day to be fixed by proclamation.

##### 2A  Power to supersede Quarantine measures under State Acts

    * (1) Whenever the GovernorGeneral is satisfied that an emergency exists which makes it necessary to do so, he or she may, by proclamation, declare that any or all measures of quarantine prescribed by or under any State Act shall, for such period as is specified in the proclamation, cease to have effect, and such measure shall thereupon cease to have effect accordingly.

    * (2) The GovernorGeneral may at any time revoke or vary any such proclamation.

##### 2B  Proclamation in event of epidemic

    * (1) Where the GovernorGeneral is satisfied that an epidemic caused by a quarantinable disease or quarantinable pest or danger of such an epidemic exists in a part of the Commonwealth, the GovernorGeneral may, by proclamation, declare the existence in that part of the Commonwealth of that epidemic or of the danger of that epidemic.

    * (2) Upon the issue of a proclamation under subsection (1) the Minister may, during the period the proclamation remains in force, give such directions and take such action as he or she thinks necessary to control and eradicate the epidemic, or to remove the danger of the epidemic, by quarantine measures or measures incidental to quarantine.

       * Note: Under section 149.1 of the _Criminal Code_, it is an offence to obstruct a person who is taking any action that the person is authorised to take under this subsection.

    * (2A) If the GovernorGeneral is satisfied that the epidemic or danger of an epidemic to which a proclamation issued under subsection (1) relates has the potential so to affect an industry of national significance that it calls for the exercise of coordinated response powers in accordance with section 3, the GovernorGeneral may, in the proclamation issued under subsection (1), declare it to be a proclamation to which section 3 applies.

    * (2B) A direction may be given, or an action taken, by the Minister under subsection (2) despite the provisions of any other Commonwealth law, or of any law of a State or Territory.

    * (3) A person is guilty of an offence if:

     * (a) a direction is given to the person under subsection (2); and

     * (b) the person fails to comply with the direction.

      * Maximum penalty: Imprisonment for 10 years.

    * (4) In paragraph (3)(a), strict liability applies to the physical element of circumstance, that the direction given to the person was under subsection (2).

       * Note: For strict liability, see section 6.1 of the _Criminal Code_.

##### 3  Coordinated response powers

    * (1) If a proclamation under subsection 2B(1) is declared to be a proclamation to which this section applies, the Minister may, during the period the proclamation remains in force, by instrument in writing:

     * (a) authorise persons who are the executive heads of national response agencies:

      * (i) to give such directions; and

      * (ii) to take such action;

     * as the persons think necessary, subject to any conditions or limitations specified under subsection (4):

      * (iii) to control and eradicate the epidemic; or

      * (iv) to remove the danger of the epidemic;

     * by quarantine measures or measures incidental to quarantine; or

     * (b) revoke any authorisation so given.

    * (2) If the Minister, under subsection (1), authorises the executive head of a national response agency to give directions, and to take action, in accordance with that subsection, the executive head of that agency may, while that authorisation remains in force, by instrument in writing:

     * (a) authorise a person performing duties in that agency:

      * (i) to give such directions of a kind that the executive head of the agency could give and that are specified in the instrument; or

      * (ii) to take such action of a kind that the executive head of the agency could take and that is specified in the instrument;

     * as the person considers necessary, subject to any conditions or limitations specified under subsection (4):

      * (iii) to control and eradicate the epidemic; or

      * (iv) to remove the danger of the epidemic;

     * by quarantine measures or measures incidental to quarantine; or

     * (b) revoke any authorisation so given.

    * (3) If an authorisation is given under subsection (1) or (2) to the holder of a specified office or position, the authorisation is to be taken to be an authorisation of any person from time to time holding, occupying, or performing the duties of, that office or position.

    * (4) An authorisation given to a person under subsection (1) or (2) may be expressed to be subject to such conditions or other limitations (if any) as are specified in the authorisation.

    * (5) If a person ceases to be the executive head of a national response agency, any authorisation of other persons in force under subsection (2) immediately before the cessation:

     * (a) is taken, on and after that cessation, to have been given by the person's successor and, subject to paragraph (b), continues to have effect according to its tenor; and

     * (b) may, by writing, be varied or revoked by that successor.

    * (6) An authorisation given to a person under subsection (1) or (2) does not affect any power that the person may be authorised to exercise apart from this section.

    * (7) An authorisation given under subsection (1) or (2) in respect of a particular epidemic or danger of an epidemic is taken to be revoked when the proclamation issued under subsection 2B(1) in respect of that epidemic or danger of an epidemic is revoked.

    * (8) A direction may be given, or an action taken, by a person under this section despite the provisions of any other Commonwealth law, or of any law of a State or Territory.

    * (9) A person is guilty of an offence if:

     * (a) a direction is given to the person under this section; and

     * (b) the person fails to comply with the direction.

      * Maximum penalty: Imprisonment for 10 years.

    * (10) In paragraph (9)(a), strict liability applies to the physical element of circumstance, that the giving of the direction was under this section.

       * Note: For strict liability, see section 6.1 of the _Criminal Code_.

    * (11) For the avoidance of doubt, a person (including the Director of Animal and Plant Quarantine, a Chief Quarantine Officer (Animals), a Chief Quarantine Officer (Plants) or a quarantine officer) is not to be taken, when acting under this Act by virtue of:

     * (a) an authorisation given by the Minister under subsection 3(1); or

     * (b) an authorisation given by the executive head of a national response agency under subsection 3(2);

    * to be acting as, exercising the powers of, or performing the functions of, a quarantine officer.

    * (12) In this section, a reference to a person performing duties in an agency includes, but is not limited to:
