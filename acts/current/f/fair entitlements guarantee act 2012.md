### An Act to provide for financial assistance for workers who have not been fully paid for work done for insolvents or bankrupts, and for related purposes

### Part 1--Preliminary

##### 1  Short title

    * This Act may be cited as the _Fair Entitlements Guarantee Act 2012_.

##### 2  Commencement

    * (1) Each provision of this Act specified in column 1 of the table commences, or is taken to have commenced, in accordance with column 2 of the table. Any other statement in column 2 has effect according to its terms.

        * Note: This table relates only to the provisions of this Act as originally enacted. It will not be amended to deal with any later amendments of this Act.

    * (2) Any information in column 3 of the table is not part of this Act. Information may be inserted in this column, or information in it may be edited, in any published version of this Act.

##### 3  Objects of this Act

    * The main objects of this Act are: 

     * (a) to provide for the Commonwealth to pay advances on account of unpaid employment entitlements of former employees of employers in cases where:

      * (i) the employers are insolvent or bankrupt; and

      * (ii) the end of the employment of the former employees was connected with that insolvency or bankruptcy; and

      * (iii) the former employees cannot get payment of the entitlements from other sources; and

     * (b) to allow the Commonwealth to recover the advances through the winding up or bankruptcy of the employers and from other payments the former employees receive for the entitlements.

##### 4  Simplified outline of this Act

    * (1) This section is a simplified outline of this Act.

    * (2) Under Part 2, a person is eligible for financial assistance under this Act (called an advance) if:

     * (a) the person's employment by an employer has ended; and

     * (b) the employer is being wound up or bankrupt; and

     * (c) the end of the employment is connected with the insolvency or bankruptcy of the employer; and

     * (d) the person has not been fully paid his or her entitlements relating to that employment; and

     * (e) the person has made a claim for the advance.

    * (3) A person's claim for an advance is decided by the Secretary, who also decides the amount of the advance if the person is eligible for it (see section 15).

    * (4) Part 3 explains how to work out the amount of an advance for a person, taking account of the person's unpaid entitlements relating to unused annual leave, unused long service leave, payment in lieu of notice, redundancy pay and wages for a 13week period. The amount may be reduced because:

     * (a) the person owes debts to his or her employer; or

     * (b) the liquidator or bankruptcy trustee expects to be able to pay those entitlements in full soon.

    * (5) Part 4 deals with payment of an advance by the Commonwealth, either:

     * (a) directly to the person eligible for the advance; or

     * (b) to the liquidator, the bankruptcy trustee or another intermediary who will pass it on to the person.

    * (6) Part 5 lets the Commonwealth recover some or all of the advance, by:

     * (a) substituting the Commonwealth for the person eligible for the advance as a creditor in the winding up or bankruptcy of the employer; and

     * (b) requiring the person to pay the Commonwealth if he or she is later paid amounts for the entitlements the advance related to.

    * (7) Part 6 deals with administrative matters, including:

     * (a) review of decisions made by the Secretary on eligibility for advances and amounts of advances (see Division 2 of Part 6); and

     * (b) use and disclosure of personal information in connection with the administration of the Act (see Division 3 of Part 6).

    * (8) Part 7 deals with various matters, including:

     * (a) letting the Secretary extend the scheme for advances to persons whose employment has ended and whose employer is in administration under the _Corporations Act 2001_; and

     * (b) allowing regulations to provide for other schemes of financial assistance for persons who worked as contractors (rather than employees) but have not been paid because of the insolvency or bankruptcy of the persons they worked for.

      * (i) to do work that is the same, or substantially the same, as the work the person did for the employer; and

      * (ii) on terms and conditions substantially similar to, and, considered on an overall basis, no less favourable than, the person's terms and conditions of employment with the employer immediately before the end of that employment.

    * (3) Subsection (2) is taken never to have applied if the transferee employs the person (whether as a result of the offer described in paragraph (2)(b) or not) and either:

     * (a) the transferee terminates that employment because the transferee no longer requires the job done by the person to be done by anyone, except where this is due to the ordinary and customary turnover of labour; or

     * (b) an insolvency event happens to the transferee, the person's employment by the transferee ends and one or more of the following applies:

      * (i) the end was due to the insolvency of the transferee;

      * (ii) the end occurred less than 6 months before the appointment of an insolvency practitioner for the transferee;

      * (iii) the end occurred on or after the appointment of an insolvency practitioner for the transferee.

        * Note: If the amount of an advance is decided, relying on subsection (2), and the events described in subsection (3) happen later (so that subsection (2) is taken never to have applied), the decision can be reviewed under Division 2 of Part 6.

    * (4) Subsection (2) does not apply for the purposes of working out the amount of an advance the person is eligible for because of an insolvency event that happened to the employer on or after 1 July 2014.

##### 17  Reduction for the person's debts to the employer

    * The Secretary may reduce the amount of an advance worked out under section 16 for a person's employment by an employer by an amount not exceeding the sum of the person's debts to the employer.

##### 18  Nil amount if liquidator or bankruptcy trustee can fully pay entitlements soon

    * The Secretary may reduce to nil the amount of an advance worked out under this Division for a person's employment by an employer if the Secretary is satisfied that the liquidator or bankruptcy trustee of the employer expects to have in the next 112 days enough money (apart from this Act) to pay the person what the amount of the advance would be apart from this section.

#### Division 2--Amounts for employment entitlements

##### Subdivision A--Working out amounts for employment entitlements

##### 19  Working out amounts for employment entitlements

    * (1) Work out the amount for each of a person's employment entitlements to be taken into account under section 16 by:

     * (b) reducing the basic amount (but not below nil) by the sum of the amounts described in subsections (2) and (3) for the entitlement.

    * (2) One amount of the reduction of the basic amount for a particular employment entitlement of a person for his or her employment by an employer is the total of amounts that:

     * (a) are attributable to the entitlement; and

     * (b) have been paid by anyone:

      * (i) to the person; or

      * (ii) to someone else for the person's benefit or in accordance with the person's direction; and

     * (c) are not costs of the winding up or bankruptcy of the employer.

      * (ii) under the _Bankruptcy Act 1966 _from the proceeds of the property of the bankrupt employer of the person; or

      * (iii) under this Act.

##### Subdivision B--General rules for basic amounts for employment entitlements

##### 20  Basic amount for annual leave entitlement

    * The basic amount for a person's annual leave entitlement for his or her employment by an employer is so much of the entitlement as is not a cost of the winding up or bankruptcy of the employer.

        * Note: Sections 25 and 26 may affect the basic amount.

##### 21  Basic amount for long service leave entitlement

    * The basic amount for a person's long service leave entitlement for his or her employment by an employer is so much of the entitlement as is not a cost of the winding up or bankruptcy of the employer.

        * Note: Sections 25 and 26 may affect the basic amount.

##### 22  Basic amount for payment in lieu of notice entitlement

    * The basic amount for a person's payment in lieu of notice entitlement for his or her employment by an employer is so much of the entitlement as:

     * (a) is not a cost of the winding up or bankruptcy of the employer; and

     * (b) does not exceed 5 weeks' pay at the rate relevant to working out that entitlement.

        * Note: Sections 25 and 26 may affect the basic amount.

##### 23  Basic amount for redundancy pay entitlement

    * The basic amount for a person's redundancy pay entitlement for his or her employment by an employer is so much of the entitlement as:

     * (a) is not a cost of the winding up or bankruptcy of the employer; and

     * (b) does not exceed the total of:

      * (i) 4 weeks' pay (at the rate relevant to working out that entitlement) for each full year of the person's service with the employer for which the employer was required to pay redundancy pay by the governing instrument for that employment; and

      * (ii) if that instrument requires payment of redundancy pay for a proportion of a year (less than a full year) of the person's service with the employer--that proportion of 4 weeks' pay (at the rate relevant to working out that entitlement).

        * Note: Sections 25 and 26 may affect the basic amount.

##### 24  Basic amount for wages entitlement

    * The basic amount for a person's wages entitlement is the wages entitlement less any amount required to be withheld under Part 25 (Pay as you go (PAYG) withholding) in Schedule 1 to the _Taxation Administration Act 1953_ from the wages covered by the entitlement.

        * Note: Sections 25 and 27 may affect the basic amount.

##### Subdivision C--Special rules for basic amounts for employment entitlements

##### 25  Disregarding recently agreed changes in terms and conditions

    * (1) This section affects a basic amount for a person's employment entitlement for his or her employment by an employer if:

     * (a) less than 6 months before the end of the employment or the appointment of an insolvency practitioner for the employer, the employer agreed to a change in the terms and conditions of the person's employment in favour of the person (whether or not the change also affected anyone else's terms and conditions of employment); and

     * (b) the Secretary is satisfied that, at the time of the change, it was not reasonable to expect that the employer would be able to meet the employer's obligations under those more favourable terms and conditions for the actual duration and end of the person's employment; and

     * (c) the Secretary is satisfied that it is appropriate that this section apply.

    * (2) Work out the basic amount as if the governing instrument for the employment had not been changed.

        * Note: This affects the basic amount by affecting the amount of the employment entitlement. It may also affect the basic amount by affecting limits on the basic amount such as those in paragraphs 22(b) and 23(b).

    * (3) If the person was employed for a partnership by 2 or more of the partners, subsection (1) applies as if:

     * (a) the first reference in paragraph (1)(a) to the employer were a reference to any of the partners who employed the person; and

     * (b) the second reference in paragraph (1)(a), and the reference in paragraph (1)(b), to the employer were a reference to all the partners who employed the person.

##### 26  Applying maximum weekly wage rate--entitlements except wages entitlement

    * (1) This section affects a basic amount for a person's employment entitlement for his or her employment if the governing instrument for the employment provided for a rate of pay relevant to working out the basic amount that, when expressed as a weekly rate, exceeded the maximum weekly wage rate at the end of the employment.

    * (2) Work out the basic amount as if the governing instrument had provided for the relevant wage rate to be the maximum weekly wage rate at the end of the employment.

        * Note: This affects the basic amount by affecting the amount of the employment entitlement. It may also affect the basic amount by affecting limits on the basic amount such as those in paragraphs 22(b) and 23(b).

    * (3) This section does not affect the basic amount for the person's wages entitlement.

##### 27  Applying maximum weekly wage rate--wages entitlement

    * (1) This section affects the basic amount for a person's wages entitlement for his or her employment by an employer if subsection (2), (3) or (4) applies.

    * When this section affects the basic amount

    * (2) This subsection applies if:

     * (a) the governing instrument for the employment provided for a rate of pay at the end of the wages entitlement period for work that the instrument envisaged that the person would do regularly; and

     * (b) that rate, when expressed as a weekly rate, exceeded the maximum weekly wage rate at the end of that period.

    * (3) This subsection applies if:

     * (a) the governing instrument for the employment did not provide for a rate of pay at the end of the wages entitlement period for work that the instrument envisaged that the person would do regularly; and

     * (b) the person's average weekly wage for that period (see subsection (5)) is greater than the maximum weekly wage at the end of that period.

        * Note: The condition in paragraph (3)(a) may be met because the governing instrument:

         * (a) did not provide for a rate described in that paragraph; or

         * (b) did not envisage that the person would do any particular work regularly.

    * (4) This subsection applies if:

     * (a) the Secretary is satisfied that, over the weeks for which the person was employed in the wages entitlement period, there is not a regular pattern of one or both of the following:

      * (i) hours worked by the person;

      * (ii) wages to which the person was entitled for work done or leave taken within those weeks; and

     * (b) the person's average weekly wage for that period (see subsection (5)) is greater than the maximum weekly wage at the end of that period.

    * (5) For the purposes of paragraphs (3)(b) and (4)(b), the person's average weekly wage for the wages entitlement period is the result of dividing the person's wages entitlement by the number of weeks for which he or she was employed by the employer in that period. That number need not be a whole number.

    * Effect on basic amount

    * (6) Work out the basic amount as if the governing instrument for the employment had entitled the person, for each of the weeks for which the employer employed the person in the wages entitlement period, to wages at the maximum weekly wage rate at the end of that period.

### Part 4--Payment of advance

##### 28  Payment to eligible person or intermediary

    * (1) On behalf of the Commonwealth, the Secretary must pay an advance a person is eligible for in relation to his or her employment by an employer:

     * (a) to the person; or

     * (b) to the liquidator or bankruptcy trustee of the employer, for the liquidator or trustee to pass on to the person, subject to the liquidator or trustee withholding or deducting an amount as required by law; or

     * (c) to another person (the **_payee_**) for the payee to pass on to the person in accordance with a contract between the payee and the Commonwealth, subject to the payee withholding or deducting an amount as required by law.

    * Payment in instalments

    * (2) The Secretary may pay the advance in instalments if the Secretary is satisfied that doing so will result in the person receiving an instalment of the advance sooner than the person would have received the advance in full if the advance were not paid in instalments.

    * (3) The Minister may direct the Secretary:

     * (a) to pay the advance that a specified person is eligible for in instalments of amounts, and at times, determined by the Secretary; or

     * (b) to pay the advances that persons who were employed by a specified employer are eligible for in instalments of amounts, and at times, determined by the Secretary.

    * (4) The Secretary must comply with the direction.

    * (5) If the direction is made in writing, the direction is not a legislative instrument.

### Part 5--Recovery of advance

#### Division 1--Recovery through winding up or bankruptcy

##### 29  Recovery of advance paid to liquidator

    * For the purposes of section 560 of the _Corporations Act 2001_, a payment of an advance for a person's employment by an employer that is made to the liquidator of the employer under section 28 of this Act is to be treated as follows:

     * (a) so much of the advance as is for the person's wages entitlement is taken to be an advance (within the meaning of section 560 of the _Corporations Act 2001_) of money by the Commonwealth for the purpose of making a payment on account of wages;

     * (b) so much of the advance as is for the person's annual leave entitlement or long service leave entitlement is taken to be an advance (within the meaning of that section) of money by the Commonwealth for the purpose of making a payment in respect of leave of absence;

     * (c) so much of the advance as is for the person's payment in lieu of notice entitlement or redundancy pay entitlement is taken to be an advance (within the meaning of that section) of money by the Commonwealth for the purpose of making a payment in respect of termination of employment.

        * Note 1: If, because of the advance, the person receives an amount on account of wages, in respect of leave of absence or in respect of termination, section 560 of the _Corporations Act 2001_ effectively gives the Commonwealth the same rights in the winding up as the person would have had for that amount if he or she had not received it.

        * Note 2: Section 32 explains how to work out what amounts of the advance are for particular entitlements if the amount of the advance has been reduced under section 17 because of the person's debts to the employer.

##### 30  Recovery of some amounts of advance paid to bankruptcy trustee

    * For the purposes of subsections 109(2) and (3) of the _Bankruptcy Act 1966_, a payment of an advance for a person's employment by an employer that is made to the bankruptcy trustee of the employer under section 28 of this Act is to be treated as follows:

     * (a) so much of the advance as is for the person's wages entitlement is taken to be moneys advanced by the Commonwealth for the purpose of enabling a payment described in paragraph 109(1)(e) of the _Bankruptcy Act 1966_;

     * (b) so much of the advance as is for the person's annual leave entitlement or long service leave entitlement is taken to be moneys advanced by the Commonwealth for the purpose of enabling a payment described in paragraph 109(1)(g) of the _Bankruptcy Act 1966_.

        * Note 1: If, because of the advance, the person receives an amount on account of services rendered to the employer before the date of the bankruptcy or in respect of leave, subsections 109(2) and (3) of the _Bankruptcy Act 1966_ effectively give the Commonwealth the same rights in the bankruptcy as the person would have had for that amount if he or she had not received it.

        * Note 2: Section 32 explains how to work out what amounts of the advance are for particular entitlements if the amount of the advance has been reduced under section 17 because of the person's debts to the employer.

        * Note 3: Section 31 applies to so much of the advance as is for the person's payment in lieu of notice entitlement or redundancy pay entitlement.

##### 31  Recovery in other circumstances

    * (1) When an advance is paid under section 28 for a person's employment by an employer, then, to the extent of the amount of the advance paid:

     * (a) the employer's liability to the person is discharged; and

     * (b) the rights the person had immediately before that discharge in relation to that liability in the winding up or bankruptcy of the employer become rights of the Commonwealth.

    * (2) So far as the advance is for a particular employment entitlement, the Commonwealth has the same priority as the person had for that entitlement.

    * (3) Subsections (1) and (2) do not apply to an amount of the advance that:

     * (a) was paid to the liquidator or bankruptcy trustee of the employer; and

     * (b) is, because of section 29 or 30 of this Act, taken for the purposes of section 560 of the _Corporations Act 2001_ or subsections 109(2) and (3) of the _Bankruptcy Act 1966_ to have been advanced.

##### 32  Amounts of advance attributable to particular employment entitlements if advance reduced for debts to employer

    * (1) This section applies for the purposes of working out for the purposes of this Part how much of an advance for a person's employment by an employer is for a particular employment entitlement if the amount of the advance is reduced under section 17 for the person's debts to the employer.

    * (2) So far as the amount of the debt applied in the reduction relates to a thing described in column 1 of an item of the following table, the reduction is taken to be of the amount of the advance for the person's employment entitlement described in column 2 of the item.

    * (3) So far as the amount of the debt applied in the reduction does not relate to a thing described in column 1 of the table in subsection (2), the reduction is taken to have applied proportionally to what would (apart from the reduction for that amount) have been the amounts of the advance that would have been for particular employment entitlements.

##### 33  Recovery of advance for employment for partnership

    * If an advance is for a person's employment for a partnership by 2 or more of the partners:

     * (a) sections 29, 30 and 31 apply in relation to each of the partners who employed the person; and

     * (b) the Commonwealth cannot recover through the winding up or bankruptcy of all of those partners one or more amounts totalling more than the amount of the advance.

#### Division 2--Recovery from person eligible for advance

##### 34  Recovery from person eligible for advance

    * (1) This section applies if:

     * (a) the Commonwealth pays someone (the **_payee_**) an advance for a person's employment by an employer; and

     * (b) an amount (the **_later amount_**) for an employment entitlement of the person for which an amount was included in the advance is later paid by someone (the **_later payer_**) to the person or for the benefit of the person or in accordance with the person's directions; and

     * (c) the later payer is not:

      * (i) the Commonwealth; or

      * (ii) the liquidator or bankruptcy trustee of the employer; or

      * (iii) the payee.

    * (2) There is a debt due by the person to the Commonwealth of the lesser of the following (or either of them if they are equal):

     * (a) the later amount;

     * (b) the difference between the advance and the sum of:

      * (i) the amounts paid to the Commonwealth in the winding up or bankruptcy of the employer because of Division 1; and

      * (ii) the debts (if any) created by previous operations of this section in relation to the person.

    * (3) A debt under this section may be recovered by the Secretary, on behalf of the Commonwealth, in a court of competent jurisdiction.
