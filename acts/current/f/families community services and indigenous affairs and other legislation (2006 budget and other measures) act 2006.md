##### 7  At the end of clause 20 of Schedule 1

##### 8  At the end of Division 5 of Part 2 of Schedule 1

   * Add: 

##### Subdivision B--Maintenance income credit balances

##### 24A  Maintenance income credit balances

    * (1) A **_maintenance income credit balance_**, for a registered entitlement of an individual, is, at any particular time, the balance at that time of the accruals under clause 24B and the depletions under clause 24E in relation to that entitlement.

    * (2) Despite subclause (1), a maintenance income credit balance for a registered entitlement at any particular time cannot exceed the total arrears owing from that registered entitlement for all income years for which the entitlement has existed.

    * (3) If:

     * (a) but for the condition in subclause 24B(3) not being met in relation to an income year, there would be an accrual to a maintenance income credit balance of an individual for a day in that income year; and

     * (b) after there has been an accrual under clause 24C for a day in a later income year or a depletion under clause 24E for a later income year, that condition is met in relation to the earlier income year;

    * the maintenance income credit balance is recalculated, taking into account the accrual for the day in the earlier income year before taking into account the accrual or depletion mentioned in paragraph (b).

    * (4) This Subdivision continues to apply in relation to a maintenance income credit balance of an individual whether or not the individual or the individual's partner continues to be eligible for family tax benefit.

##### 24B  Accruals to a maintenance income credit balance

    * _Accrual if conditions are satisfied_

    * _	(1)	There is an accrual to a maintenance income credit balance for a registered entitlement of an individual, for a day in an income year, of the amount worked out under clause 24C for that day, if all the conditions in this clause are satisfied.

    * _Conditions that must be satisfied_

    * _	(2)	Either or both of the following must apply:

     * (a) the individual is eligible for family tax benefit for the day;

     * (b) if the individual is a member of a couple on the day--the individual's partner is eligible for family tax benefit for the day.

    * (3) The eligible person must have satisfied the FTB reconciliation conditions in section 32B of the Family Assistance Administration Act for all of the same-rate benefit periods (within the meaning of that section) that are included in the income year.

    * (4) The annualised amount of the maintenance income of the eligible person for the day must be less than the maintenance income free area that applied to the eligible person for that day.

    * (5) The maintenance income that the individual received in the income year from the registered entitlement must be less than the amount due in the income year from the registered entitlement.

##### 24C  Amount of accrual to a maintenance income credit balance

    * (1) This is how to work out the amount of the accrual under clause 24B, for a day in an income year, to a maintenance income credit balance for a registered entitlement of an individual who is, or is the partner of, an eligible person under subclause 24B(2):

    * _Method statement_

       * Step 1.	_Work out the global maintenance entitlement of the eligible person for the day using clause 24D.

       * _Step 2.	_Identify the lower of:

        * (a) that global maintenance entitlement; and

        * (b) the maintenance income free area that applied to the eligible person for the day.

       * _Step 3.	_Subtract from the lower amount identified in step 2 the annualised amount of the maintenance income of the eligible person for the day.

       * _Step 4.	_Divide the result of step 3 by 365.

       * _Step 5.	_Unless subclause (2) applies to the individual, the amount that accrues to the maintenance income credit balance of the individual for the day is the amount worked out under step 4.

       * If subclause (2) applies to the individual, take the amount worked out under step 4 and apply the method statement in subclause (2).

    * (2) If either or both of the following apply:

     * (a) the individual has more than one registered entitlement for the day in respect of which the condition in subclause 24B(5) is met;

     * (b) if the individual is a member of a couple on the day--the individual's partner has one or more registered entitlements for the day in respect of which the condition in subclause 24B(5) is met;

    * this is how to work out the amount of the accrual under clause 24B, for a day in an income year, to each of the maintenance income credit balances (the **_relevant balances_**) for those entitlements:

    * _Method statement_

       * Step 1._	Work out the daily cap for each relevant balance. The **_daily cap_** for a relevant balance is the excess of the amount due in the income year from the registered entitlement to which the balance relates over the maintenance income received in the income year from the registered entitlement, divided by 365.

       * _Step 2.	_Distribute the amount worked out under step 4 of the method statement in subclause (1) equally among each relevant balance, up to the amount of the daily cap for the relevant balance.

       * _Step 3.	_Distribute any remaining amount equally among each relevant balance for which the daily cap has not been reached, up to the amount of the daily cap for the relevant balance.

       * _Step 4.	_Reapply step 3 to any remaining amount until:

        * (a) there is no remaining amount to distribute; or

        * (b) the daily cap for each relevant balance is reached.
