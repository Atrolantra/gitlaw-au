### Part VII--Collection and recovery of tax

#### Division 1--General

##### 90  When tax payable

    * Subject to this Part, tax assessed in respect of a year of tax becomes due and payable, or shall be deemed to have become due and payable, as the case requires, on 21 May in the next year of tax.

        * Note: For provisions about collection and recovery of tax, see Part 415 in Schedule 1 to the _Taxation Administration Act 1953_.

##### 93  Unpaid tax

    * (1) If any of the tax (including additional tax) which a person is liable to pay remains unpaid after the time by which the tax is due to be paid, the person is liable to pay the general interest charge on the unpaid amount for each day in the period that:

     * (a) started at the beginning of the day by which the tax was due to be paid; and

     * (b) finishes at the end of the last day on which, at the end of the day, any of the following remains unpaid:

      * (i) the tax;

      * (ii) general interest charge on any of the tax.

    * (2) The amount of the general interest charge is taken to be additional tax payable under this section.

        * Note: The general interest charge is worked out under Part IIA of the _Taxation Administration Act 1953_.

##### 100  Person in receipt or control of money of nonresident

    * (1) A person who has authority to receive, control or dispose of money belonging to a nonresident who is liable to an amount of tax shall, when required by the Commissioner by notice in writing served on the person, pay the amount of tax and, by force of this section, is, when so required:

     * (a) authorised and required to retain from time to time any money that comes to the person on behalf of the nonresident or so much of it as is sufficient to pay the amount of tax payable by the nonresident;

     * (b) made personally liable for the amount of tax after it becomes payable to the extent of any amount so retained, or which should have been so retained, under paragraph (a); and

     * (c) indemnified for all payments that the person makes pursuant to this section.

    * (2) For the purposes of subsection (1), a person who is liable to pay money to a nonresident shall be deemed to be a person who has the control of money belonging to the nonresident, and all money due by the person to the nonresident shall be deemed to be money that comes to the person on behalf of the nonresident.

    * (3) Where the Commonwealth, a State or Territory, or an authority of the Commonwealth, a State or Territory has the receipt, control or disposal of money belonging to a nonresident, this section (other than paragraph (1)(b)) applies to and in relation to the Commonwealth, the State or the Territory, or the authority of the Commonwealth, of the State or of the Territory, as the case may be, in the same manner as it applies to and in relation to any other person.

    * (4) In this section, **_tax_** includes additional tax under section 93.

#### Division 2--Collection by instalments

##### Subdivision A--General

##### 101  Interpretation

    * (1) In sections 93, 100 and 129, but not in any other section of this Act,**_ tax_** includes an instalment of tax payable under this Division.

    * (2) In sections 100 and 129, but not in any other section of this Act, **_tax_** includes additional tax payable under subsection 112(4).

    * (3) The ascertainment of the notional tax amount, or the amount of any instalment of tax, in accordance with this Division shall not be deemed to be an assessment within the meaning of any of the provisions of this Act.

##### 102  Liability to pay instalments of tax

    * For the purpose of securing generally the more expeditious collection of tax, an employer is liable to pay, in accordance with this Division, 4 instalments of tax in respect of each year of tax.

##### 103  When instalment of tax payable

    * (1) Subject to this Division, the 4 instalments of tax payable in respect of a year of tax are due and payable as follows:

    * (2) Despite subsection (1), and subject to this Division, if an employer is a deferred BAS payer on the day specified as the day on which an instalment is due and payable under subsection (1), that instalment is instead due and payable as specified in the following table:

        * Note: For provisions about collection and recovery of instalments of fringe benefits tax, see Part 415 in Schedule 1 to the _Taxation Administration Act 1953_.

##### 104  Notice of the amount of an instalment

    * An employer must notify the Commissioner, in the approved form, of the amount of an instalment on or before the day on which the instalment is due and payable.

##### 105  Credit for instalments payable

    * (1) An employer is entitled to a credit when the Commissioner:

     * (a) makes an assessment of the tax payable by the employer for a year of tax; or 

     * (b) determines that no tax is payable.

        * Note: The employer's first return for the year of tax is treated as an assessment: see section 72.

    * (2) The credit is equal to:

     *  	the total of each instalment (if any) payable by the employer for the year of tax;

    * reduced by: 

     *  	the total of any credits the employer has claimed under section 112A because of one or more instalments of tax for the year of tax.

        * Note: An employer can claim a credit under section 112A in some cases where the amount by reference to which an instalment is worked out reduces during the year of tax.

    * (3) The making of the assessment or determination, and the resulting credit entitlement, do not affect the liability to pay an instalment.

        * Note: How the credit is applied is set out in Division 3 of Part IIB of the _Taxation Administration Act 1953_.

##### Subdivision C--Working out the amount of instalments

##### 109  Interpretation

    * In this Subdivision: 

    * **_employer's estimate_**, in relation to an employer, in relation to an instalment of tax in relation to a year of tax, means the amount shown in a statement by the employer under subsection 112(1) in relation to the instalment as the employer's estimate of the tax that will be payable by the employer in respect of the year of tax.

    * **_estimated tax_**, in relation to an employer in relation to a year of tax, means the amount determined, or last determined, as the case requires, under subsection 112(2) or (3) as the estimated tax of the employer in respect of the year of tax.

    * **_GIC period_**, in relation to an instalment in relation to a year of tax, has the meaning given by the following table:

    * **_relevant fraction_**, in relation to an instalment, means:

     * (a) 0.25 for a first instalment; or

     * (b) 0.50 for a second instalment; or

     * (c) 0.75 for a third instalment; or

     * (d) 1.00 for a fourth instalment.

##### 110  Notional tax amount

    * (1) An employer's **_notional tax amount_** for a year of tax (the **_current year_**) as at a particular time (the **_test time_**) is worked out using the table, except as provided in subsections (3), (4) and (5).

        * Note: The employer's first return for the year of tax is treated as an assessment: see section 72.

    * (3) The Commissioner may determine that the employer's **_notional tax amount_** for the current year is such amount as the Commissioner estimates will be the tax payable by the employer for that year, if the Commissioner has reason to believe that that tax will exceed:

     * (a) if the notional tax amount would otherwise be worked out under item 1 or 4 of the table in subsection (1)--the amount of the employer's tax for the base year; or

     * (b) if the notional tax amount would otherwise be worked out under item 2 or 3 of the table in subsection (1)--nil.

    * (4) Where the Commissioner makes a determination under subsection (3):

     * (a) the Commissioner shall cause a notice in writing to be served on the employer specifying:

      * (i) the notional tax amount determined by the Commissioner; and

      * (ii) the date on which the determination takes effect, being a date not less than 30 days after the date of service of the notice; and

     * (b) subject to subsection (5), the notional tax amount of the employer in respect of the year of tax is, on and after the date specified in the notice, the amount determined by the Commissioner.

    * (5) Where, in relation to an instalment of tax in respect of a year of tax, being an instalment that becomes due and payable after the end of a quarter, an employer has estimated pursuant to subsection 112(1) the amount of tax that will be payable in respect of that year of tax and has furnished to the Commissioner a statement in accordance with that subsection, then, on and after the last day of the quarter and until such time as there is a further application of this subsection in relation to a subsequent instalment of tax payable by the employer, the notional tax amount of the employer in respect of the year of tax is, or shall be deemed to have been, as the case requires, an amount equal to the estimated tax.

##### 111  Amount of instalment of tax

    * (1) The amount of an instalment of tax of an employer for a year of tax that becomes due and payable after the end of a quarter is the amount worked out using this formula, if the amount is positive:

    * Otherwise, the amount of the instalment is nil.

        * Note: If the notional tax amount is too small, the instalment may not be payable: see subsection (2).

    * (1A) For the purposes of the formula in subsection (1):

    * **_notional tax amount_** means the employer's notional tax amount for the year of tax, as at the end of the last day of that quarter.

    * **_previous credits_** means the total of any credits the employer has claimed under section 112A because of one or more instalments of tax for the same year of tax that became due and payable before that day.

    * **_previous instalments_** means the total of any instalments of tax for the same year of tax that became due and payable by the employer before that day.

    * (2) An instalment of tax in respect of a year of tax that would otherwise become due and payable by an employer after the end of a quarter is not payable if:

     * (a) the instalment is calculated by reference to a notional tax amount ascertained under subsection 110(1); and

     * (b) the notional tax amount by reference to which the instalment was calculated is less than:

      * (i) if a determination of an amount is in force under subsection (3) in respect of the year of tax--that amount; or

      * (ii) in any other case--$1,000; and

     * (c) unless that quarter is the first quarter in the year of tax--because of one or more previous applications of this subsection, the instalment that would otherwise have become due and payable by the employer after the end of the previous quarter is not payable.

    * (3) The Commissioner may, by notice in writing in the _Gazette_, determine an amount other than $1,000 as the amount applicable for the purposes of subsection (2) in respect of a year or years of tax specified in the determination.

##### 112  Estimated tax 

    * (1) An employer may, not later than the date on which an instalment of tax in respect of a year of tax is due and payable or within such further period as the Commissioner allows:

     * (a) make an estimate of the amount of the tax (if any) that will be payable by the employer in respect of that year of tax; and

     * (b) furnish to the Commissioner a written statement, in the approved form, showing:

      * (i) the amount so estimated; and

      * (ii) the basis on which the estimate has been made;

    * unless the employer has previously furnished a statement under this subsection in relation to the instalment of tax.

    * (2) Where an employer furnishes to the Commissioner, in relation to an instalment of tax, a statement under subsection (1), the estimated tax is, subject to subsection (3), an amount equal to the employer's estimate.

    * (3) Where, having regard to information in returns furnished by the employer and any other information in the Commissioner's possession, the Commissioner has reason to believe that the amount of tax that will be payable by the employer in respect of the year of tax is greater than the employer's estimate:

     * (a) the Commissioner may estimate the amount that, in the Commissioner's opinion, should have been the amount estimated by the employer pursuant to subsection (1) in respect of that year of tax; and

     * (b) the estimated tax is:

      * (i) an amount equal to the amount of tax so estimated by the Commissioner; or 

      * (ii) the amount that would be the notional tax amount of the employer in respect of the year of tax if the employer had not furnished a statement under subsection (1);

     * whichever is the less. 

##### 112A  Credit in certain cases where amount of instalment is nil

    * (1) If an amount worked out using the formula in subsection 111(1) is negative, the employer is entitled to claim a credit equal to that amount, expressed as a positive amount.

        * Note: This will happen if the notional tax amount has reduced since the end of an earlier quarter because, for example:

           * the employer has made an estimate under section 112 of its tax for the current year; or

           * an assessment has been made for a more recent year of tax before the current year.

    * (2) A claim for a credit must be made in the approved form after the end of the quarter.

        * Note: How the credit is applied is set out in Division 3 of Part IIB of the _Taxation Administration Act 1953_.

##### 112B  Liability to GIC on shortfall in quarterly instalment worked out on the basis of estimated tax

    * (1) An employer is liable to pay the general interest charge under this section if:

     * (a) in order to determine the amount of an instalment of tax (the **_underpaid instalment_**) of the employer for a year of tax, an amount (whether positive, negative or nil) (the **_actual amount_**) was worked out using the formula in subsection 111(1); and

     * (b) because of subsection 110(5), the notional tax amount used in working out the actual amount was an estimate by the employer under subsection 112(1); and

     * (c) that notional tax amount is less than 90% of the employer's tax assessed for the year of tax; and

     * (d) that assessed tax has become due and payable.

        * Note: Paragraph (1)(b) is not satisfied if the notional tax amount used in working out the actual amount was estimated tax worked out under subsection 112(3) because the Commissioner disagrees with the employer's estimate.

    * (2) The employer is liable to pay the charge, for each day in the GIC period, on the amount (if any) by which the actual amount is _less than_ the amount (whether positive, negative or nil) worked out using the formula:

    * (3) For the purposes of the formula in subsection (2):

    * **_minimum tax amount_** means the lesser of:

     * (a) the amount that, apart from subsection 110(5), would have been the notional tax amount used in working out the actual amount; and

     * (b) the employer's tax assessed for the year of tax.

    * **_previous credits_** means the total of any credits the employer has claimed under section 112A because of one or more instalments of tax for the same year of tax that became due and payable before that day.

    * **_previous instalments_** means the total of any instalments of tax for the same year of tax that became due and payable by the employer before the day on which the underpaid instalment became due and payable (or would have become due and payable if the actual amount had been positive).

    * (4) The amount of the general interest charge is taken to be **_additional tax_** payable under this section.

##### 113  Notice of alteration of amount of instalment

    * Where, by reason of the operation of subsection 112(3), the amount payable by an employer as an instalment of tax is greater than the instalment that would have been payable if it had been ascertained by reference to the employer's estimate, the Commissioner shall cause to be served on the employer a notice in writing specifying:

     * (a) the amount of the increase in the instalment of tax that became payable by reason of subsection 112(3); and

     * (b) a date as the due date for payment of that amount, being a date not less than 14 days after the date of service of the notice;

    * and the amount of the increase in the instalment of tax so specified is, notwithstanding section 103, due and payable on the date so specified.

### Part X--Statutory evidentiary documents

##### 124  Assessments

    * (1) Where the Commissioner does not have sufficient information to make an assessment of the fringe benefits taxable amount of an employer of a year of tax, that fringe benefits taxable amount shall be deemed, for the purposes of making an assessment under this Act, to be such amount as, in the opinion of the Commissioner, might reasonably be expected to be that fringe benefits taxable amount.

    * (2) In determining whether an assessment is correct, any determination, opinion or judgment of the Commissioner made, held or formed in connection with the consideration of an objection against the assessment shall be deemed to have been made, held or formed when the assessment was made.

##### 124A  Assessment on assumption

    * (1) Subject to subsection (4), where:

     * (a) an employee of an employer has derived eligible foreign remuneration or foreign earnings during a year of tax; and

     * (b) at the time of making an assessment of the fringe benefits taxable amount of the employer of the year of tax, it is reasonable to assume that, at a later time, circumstances will exist because of which that eligible foreign remuneration or foreign earnings, as the case may be, will be exempt income by virtue of section 23AF or 23AG of the_ Income Tax Assessment Act 1936_;

    * this Act applies as if those circumstances existed at the time of making that assessment.

    * (2) Subject to subsection (4), where, at the time of making an assessment of the fringe benefits taxable amount of an employer of a year of tax, it is reasonable to assume that, at a later time, circumstances will exist because of which a benefit provided in respect of the employment of an employee of the employer in, or in respect of, the year of tax will be an exempt benefit by virtue of section 58B, 58C or 58D, this Act applies as if those circumstances existed at the time of making that assessment.

    * (3) Subject to subsection (4), where:

     * (a) a fringe benefit (in this subsection called the **_temporary accommodation fringe benefit_**) of a kind referred to in paragraph 61C(1)(a) is provided in, or in respect of, a year of tax in respect of the employment of an employee of an employer; and

     * (b) at the time of making an assessment of the fringe benefits taxable amount of the employer of the year of tax, it is reasonable to assume that, at a later time, circumstances will exist because of which section 61C will apply to reduce the taxable value of the temporary accommodation fringe benefit in relation to the year of tax by a particular amount;

    * this Act applies as if those circumstances existed at the time of making that assessment.

    * (4) Where this Act has, by virtue of subsection (1), (2) or (3), applied on the basis that a circumstance that did not exist at the time of making an assessment would exist at a later time and the Commissioner, after making the assessment, becomes satisfied that that circumstance will not exist, then, notwithstanding section 74, the Commissioner may amend the assessment at any time for the purposes of ensuring that this Act shall be taken always to have applied on the basis that that circumstance did not exist.

### Part XIA--Record keeping exemption

#### Division 1--Overview of Part

##### 135A  Overview of Part

    * (1) Basically, this Part provides that, if certain conditions are satisfied, an employer need not keep or retain most of the records otherwise required to be kept and retained under subsection 132(1).

    * (2) If the conditions are satisfied, the employer's FBT liability is generally worked out using the aggregate fringe benefits amount from a previous FBT year (the **_base year_**) instead of the current FBT year.

#### Division 2--Conditions

##### 135B  Conditions that must be satisfied

    * (1) This section has 2 conditions that must be satisfied for Division 3 to apply to an employer for an FBT year (the **_current year_**).

    *  First condition: base year established

    * (2) Either of the following must be true:

     * (a) the FBT year immediately before the current year was a base year (see section 135C) of the employer; or

     * (b) some other FBT year before the current year was a base year of the employer and section 135G applied to the employer for every FBT year after that base year but before the current year.

    *  Second condition: no Commissioner's notice in previous year

    * (3) The employer must not have been given a paragraph 135E(2)(c) notice by the Commissioner during the FBT year immediately before the current year.

##### 135C  What is a base year?

    * (1) An FBT year is a **_base year_** of an employer if:

     * (a) the employer carries on business operations throughout the FBT year; and

     * (b) the employer lodges an FBT return for the FBT year within the time allowed for doing so under section 68; and

     * (c) as at the declaration date for the FBT year, the employer has kept and retained all the records that are (ignoring section 135E) required to be kept and retained under subsection 132(1) in relation to the employer's liability under this Act for the FBT year; and

     * (d) the employer's aggregate fringe benefits amount for the FBT year does not exceed the exemption threshold (see subsections (2) and (3)) for the year; and

     * (e) section 135G does not apply to the employer for the FBT year (that section allows employers to work out their liability to pay tax using their aggregate fringe benefits amount from a previous base year, instead of the current FBT year).

    * Exemption threshold for 199697 FBT year

    * (2) The **_exemption threshold_** for the FBT year beginning on 1 April 1996 is $5,000.

    * Exemption threshold for later FBT years

    * (3) The **_exemption threshold_** for a later FBT year is the amount worked out using the formula:

    * where: 

    * **_exemption threshold_** is the exemption threshold for the previous FBT year.

    * **_indexation factor_** is the number worked out, to 3 decimal places (rounding up if the fourth decimal place is 5 or more), under subsection (4) for the later FBT year.

    * Indexation factor

    * (4) The indexation factor for an FBT year is the greater of:

     * (a) 1; and

     * (b) the number worked out using the formula:

    * (5) In subsection (4):

    * **_earlier December year _**means the period of 12 months immediately before the most recent December year.

    * **_index number_**, for a quarter, means the All Groups Consumer Price Index number for the quarter (being the weighted average of the 8 capital cities) first published by the Australian Statistician for the quarter.

    * **_most recent December year _**means the period of 12 months ending on 31 December immediately before the FBT year for which the threshold is being worked out.

    * Disregard new publications

    * (6) If the Australian Statistician publishes an index number for a quarter in substitution for an index number previously published for that quarter, disregard the later publication.

    * Changed reference base

    * (7) However, if the Australian Statistician changes the reference base for the Consumer Price Index, take into account only the index numbers published in terms of the new reference base.

    * Rounding down to whole dollar amount

    * (8) Round the subsection (3) result down to the nearest whole dollar (if the result is not already a number of whole dollars).

#### Division 3--Consequences if conditions in Division 2 are satisfied

##### 135D  Consequences

    * This Division has the consequences that apply if both conditions in section 135B are satisfied in relation to an employer for an FBT year (the **_current year_**).

##### 135E  Exemption from keeping records

    * (1) Subsection 132(1) (which requires certain records to be kept and retained) does not apply to the employer in relation to the employer's liability under this Act for the current year.

    * Records the employer must still keep

    * (2) However, subsection 132(1) still applies in relation to the employer's liability under this Act for the current year so far as it relates to the following:

     * (a) copies of records that an associate of the employer gives the employer under paragraph 132(2)(b);

     * (b) benefits provided at a time when the employer was:

      * (i) a government body (see subsection 136(1)); or

      * (ii) a person all of whose income is exempt from income tax;

     * (c) benefits provided after the Commissioner has given the employer a written notice under this paragraph, during the current year, requiring the employer to resume keeping records.

##### 135F  Keeping records for 5 years after they are last relied on

    * The period in paragraph 132(1)(b) for retaining records relating to the employer's liability under this Act in respect of the employer's most recent base year is extended (or further extended) to 5 years after the end of the current year (if the period is not already that long).

##### to work out liability

    * The employer's liability to pay tax under section 66 is worked out using the employer's aggregate fringe benefits amount for the employer's most recent base year, instead of for the current year.

##### 135H  Exception if employer chooses to use current year aggregate fringe benefits amount

    * Section 135G does not apply if the employer chooses to work out his or her liability using the employer's aggregate fringe benefits amount for the current year.

##### 135J  Exception if employer is government body or taxexempt

    * Section 135G does not apply if the employer is: 

     * (a) a government body (see subsection 136(1)); or

     * (b) a person all of whose income is exempt from income tax;

    * at any time during the current year.

##### 135K  Exception if aggregate fringe benefits amount increases too much

    * (1) Section 135G does not apply if the employer's aggregate fringe benefits amount for the current year is more than 20% greater than it was for the employer's most recent base year (unless the difference is $100 or less).

        * Example: The aggregate fringe benefits amount was $100 for the most recent base year and $180 for the current year. This is 80% greater--well over the 20% limit. But section 135G can still apply because the difference is only $80.

    * Special rules for applying this test

    * (2) In working out, for the purposes of subsection (1), the employer's aggregate fringe benefits amount for the current year, apply the following rules.

    * Section 123 disregarded

    * (3) Disregard the effect of section 123 (which deals with failing to retain statutory evidentiary documents).

    * Special rule for car fringe benefits--statutory formula method used in earlier year

    * (4) If:

     * (a) for the employer's first car benefit year (if any--see subsection (6)), the employer used the method in section 9 (statutory formula) to determine the taxable value of one or more car fringe benefits relating to a particular car; and

     * (b) the employer uses the same method for that car, or for a car provided as a replacement of that car, for the current year; and

     * (c) the annualised number of kilometres the car (or its replacement) travelled in the current year is at least 80% of the annualised number of kilometres the car travelled in the first car benefit year;

    * the employer may, in using that same method, use the statutory fraction for the car from the first car benefit year, instead of from the current year.

    * Special rule for car fringe benefits--cost basis method used in earlier year

    * (5) If:

     * (a) for the employer's first car benefit year (if any--see subsection (6)), the employer used the method in section 10 (cost basis) to determine the taxable value of one or more car fringe benefits relating to a particular car; and

     * (b) the employer uses the same method for that car, or for a car provided as a replacement of that car, for the current year; and

     * (c) the business use percentage (see subsection 136(1)) for the current year is not lower than the business use percentage for the first car benefit year by more than 20 percentage points;

    * the employer may, in using that same method, use the business use percentage for the car from the first car benefit year, instead of from the current year.

    * Meaning of **first car benefit year**

    * **	(6)	In subsections (4) and (5), the employer's **_first car benefit year_** is the first FBT year (if any) in the period:

     * (a) beginning with the employer's most recent base year; and

     * (b) ending with the FBT year immediately before the current year;

    * during which one or more car fringe benefits were provided in relation to the employer.

##### 135L  Employer not in business throughout current year

    * (1) This section applies if the employer does not carry on business operations throughout the current year.

    * Prorata reduction of base year aggregate fringe benefits amount

    * (2) For the purposes of sections 135G and 135K, the employer's aggregate fringe benefits amount for the employer's most recent base year is replaced by the amount worked out using the following formula:

### Part XIB--Reportable fringe benefits totals

##### 135M  Simplified outline of this Part

    * The following is a simplified outline of this Part: 

    * An employee's reportable fringe benefits total for a year of income is the sum of each of the employee's reportable fringe benefits amounts for the year of income (see section 135N). (The total is taken into account under other Acts; for example in working out some income tax rebates, Medicare levy surcharge and superannuation surcharge and whether the employee must make a repayment of a debt under the _Higher Education Support Act 2003_.)

    * An employee's reportable fringe benefits amount from an employer is generally the grossedup value of the employee's individual fringe benefits amount from that employer (see section 135P).

    * Special rules apply for working out the employee's reportable fringe benefits amount in respect of the employee's employment if the benefits provided in respect of the employment include exempt benefits under section 57A or 58 (about employment with public benevolent institutions, certain hospitals, public ambulance services, health promotion charities and bodies providing care for sick, elderly or disadvantaged persons) (see section 135Q).

##### 135N  Employee's reportable fringe benefits total

    * An employee's **_reportable fringe benefits total_** for a year of income is the sum of each of the employee's reportable fringe benefits amounts for the year of income in respect of the employee's employment by an employer.

        * Example: Sylvia employs Angela, who has a reportable fringe benefits amount of $3,000 for the 19992000 year of income from her employment by Sylvia.

        * Angela is also an employee of Geoff, and has a reportable fringe benefits amount of $4,000 for that year of income from her employment by Geoff.

        * Angela's reportable fringe benefits total for the 19992000 year of income is $7,000.

##### 135P  Employee's reportable fringe benefits amount--general rule

    * Does an employee have a reportable fringe benefits amount?

    * (1) An employee has a **_reportable fringe benefits amount_** for a year of income in respect of the employee's employment by an employer if the employee's individual fringe benefits amount for the year of tax ending on 31 March in the year of income in respect of the employee's employment by the employer is more than $2,000.

        * Example 1: On 31 May 2007, Sylvia waives a debt of $2,545 that her employee Angela owes her, thus providing Angela with a debt waiver fringe benefit with a taxable value of $2,545 for the year of tax ending on 31 March 2008. Angela has a reportable fringe benefits amount for the year of income ending on 30 June 2008 in respect of her employment by Sylvia.

        * Example 2: On 1 March 2008, Angela's employer Neil waives a debt of $1,900 Angela owes him, providing Angela with a debt waiver fringe benefit with a taxable value of $1,900 for the year of tax ending on 31 March 2008. However, he does not provide any other fringe benefits for that year of tax in respect of her employment, so Angela does not have a reportable fringe benefits amount for the year of income ending on 30 June 2008 in respect of her employment by Neil.

    * Size of the reportable fringe benefits amount

    * (2) The **_reportable fringe benefits amount_** is the amount worked out using the formula:

    * where: 

    * **_individual fringe benefits amount_** is the employee's individual fringe benefits amount for the year of tax in respect of the employee's employment by the employer.

##### 135Q  Reportable fringe benefits amount for some employees of certain institutions

    * Overview

    * (1) This section explains how to work out whether an employee has a reportable fringe benefits amount for a year of income in respect of the employee's employment by an employer described in section 57A or 58, and the size of that amount, if:

     * (a) a benefit is provided in respect of the employee's employment by the employer; and

     * (b) the benefit is an exempt benefit because of one of those sections; and

     * (c) apart from those sections, the benefit would be a fringe benefit relating to the employee, the employer and the year of tax ending on 31 March in the employee's year of income.

        * Note: Section 57A deals with public benevolent institutions, certain registered charities, employers of employees connected with certain hospitals and employers of employees connected with public ambulance services. Section 58 deals with persons employed by government bodies, religious institutions and nonprofit companies to care for the elderly or disadvantaged.

    * Does an employee have a reportable fringe benefits amount?

    * (2) The employee has a **_reportable fringe benefits amount_** (worked out under subsection (4)) for the year of income in respect of the employee's employment by the employer if the sum of the following is more than $2,000:

     * (a) the employee's individual fringe benefits amount (if any) for the year of tax ending on 31 March in the year of income in respect of the employee's employment by the employer;

     * (b) the employee's individual quasifringe benefits amount for the year of tax ending on 31 March in the year of income in respect of the employee's employment by the employer.

        * Note: An employee of an employer described in section 57A will not have an individual fringe benefits amount from that employer, because all benefits provided in respect of employment by that employer are exempt benefits.

    * What is the employee's **individual quasifringe benefits amount**?

    * (3) The employee's **_individual quasifringe benefits amount_** is the amount that would be the employee's individual fringe benefits amount for the year of tax in respect of the employee's employment by the employer if:

     * (a) each benefit described in subsection (1) in relation to the employee, employer and year of tax were a fringe benefit; and

     * (b) there were no other fringe benefits relating to the employee, the employer and the year of tax.

        * Note: Section 5E explains how to work out the employee's individual fringe benefits amount for the year of tax.

    * Size of the reportable fringe benefits amount

    * (4) The **_reportable fringe benefits amount_** is the amount worked out using the formula:

    * where: 

    * **_individual fringe benefits amount_** is the employee's individual fringe benefits amount (if any) for the year of tax in respect of the employee's employment by the employer.

    * **_individual quasifringe benefits amount_** is the employee's individual quasifringe benefits amount for the year of tax in respect of the employee's employment by the employer.

    * **_rate of tax_** is the rate of tax for the year of tax.

    * Relationship with section 135P

    * (5) This section has effect despite section 135P.

    * Agreement about consequences of transitional events

    * (3) The Commissioner may enter into a written agreement with a State or Territory about what is to happen in respect of the following when a transitional event occurs:

     * (a) whether a register kept by the State or Territory, or a nominated State or Territory body, is to be treated as a valid register for the purposes of Subdivision D of Division 10A of Part III of the Act (which deals with the 12 week record keeping method for car parking fringe benefits) and the employees and FBT years in relation to which the register is to be treated as valid;

     * (c) whether a benefit that would otherwise lose its character as an amortised fringe benefit under section 65CA is to be treated as an amortised fringe benefit;

     * (d) whether a benefit that would not otherwise be covered by a recurring fringe benefit declaration under section 152A is to be treated as being covered by the declaration;

     * (e) whether a year of tax is to be treated as a log book year of tax of the State or Territory, or a nominated State or Territory body, for the purposes of the application of section 10 in relation to a car fringe benefit in relation to that State or Territory, or that nominated State or Territory body, in relation to a particular car or class of cars (however described);

     * (f) whether a year of tax that is a base year of tax for the purposes of section 26 is to continue to be treated as a base year of tax.
