### Part 2--Liability

##### 6  Taxable amount

   * (1) A taxable amount is any amount that meets all the following conditions:

    * (a) a State is liable to repay the amount to a person (the **_taxpayer_**) because a State franchise law is wholly or partly invalid because of section 90 of the Constitution;

    * (b) the amount is by way of repayment of an amount paid under the State franchise law before 5 August 1997 in respect of a licensing period commencing before 5 August 1997;

    * (c) the amount is claimed by the taxpayer from the State, or a court orders the State to pay the amount to the taxpayer.

   * (2) A taxable amount is reduced by deducting any part of it that a State would have been liable to repay even if the State franchise law were wholly valid.

     * Example: An amount that is repayable solely because of an overpayment by the taxpayer would be deducted.

##### 7  Reduction of taxable amount--liquor franchise fees

   * (1) If a taxable amount calculated under section 6 relates to a liquor franchise fee for which the licensing period ends after 6 August 1997, then the taxable amount is reduced by an amount calculated as follows:

   * (2) If:

    * (a) a State franchise law required or permitted the payment by instalments of a liquor franchise fee for a licensing period (the **_actual licensing period_**); and

    * (b) at least one of those instalments was payable after 6 August 1997;

   * then this section applies as if each of the following periods were a separate licensing period (in place of the actual licensing period):

    * (c) the period starting on the day on which an instalment was payable and ending immediately before the day on which the next instalment was payable;

    * (d) the period starting on the day on which last instalment was payable and ending at the end of the actual licensing period.

   * (3) In this section:

   * **_liquor franchise fee_** means a fee payable under a law specified in paragraph 4(2)(a), (e), (g), (h), (k), (o), (t) or (v).

##### 8  Liability to windfall tax

   * (1) The taxpayer in respect of a taxable amount is the person to whom the State was liable to repay the taxable amount.

     * Note: Section 9 extinguishes the liability of the State to repay the taxable amount.

   * (2) The person who is the taxpayer in respect of a taxable amount is liable to pay windfall tax on the taxable amount.

### Part 3--Collection

##### 9  State must withhold windfall tax from taxable amounts

   * _State must withhold and remit windfall tax_

   * _	(1)	A State that is liable to repay a taxable amount must not repay or otherwise apply the taxable amount without first having deducted the tax on the taxable amount.

   * (2) As soon as practicable after making a deduction under subsection (1), the State must notify the taxpayer in writing that the deduction was made.

   * (3) A State that makes a deduction under subsection (1) must remit it to the Commissioner within 21 days after the end of the month in which the deduction is made. The remitted tax must be accompanied by a statement that:

    * (a) sets out the amount deducted; and

    * (b) identifies the taxpayer.

   * _State discharged from liability to account_

   * _	(4)	When a State makes a deduction from a taxable amount under subsection (1) (or purportedly under subsection (1)), the State is discharged from any liability to pay or account for the amount deducted to any person other than the Commissioner.

##### 10  Taxpayer entitled to credit for amount deducted by State

   * (1) When a State makes a deduction from a taxable amount under section 9 (or purportedly under section 9), the taxpayer is entitled to a credit equal to the amount deducted.

   * (2) However, the taxpayer is not entitled to a credit for any amount purportedly deducted under section 9 in relation to an amount paid under a valid State franchise law.

   * (3) The credit is a debt due to the taxpayer by the Commissioner on behalf of the Commonwealth.

   * (4) The Commissioner may apply some or all of the credit against the taxpayer's liability to windfall tax (whether or not that liability is in respect of the taxable amount that gives rise to the credit). The Commissioner must refund any amount not applied.

##### 11  Regulations for collection etc. of unpaid windfall tax

   * The regulations may provide for the collection and recovery of any unpaid windfall tax. In particular, the regulations may:

    * (a) prescribe the time when windfall tax is due for payment; and

    * (b) prescribe penalties for late payment of windfall tax (not exceeding an amount calculated at the rate of 20% per annum).

     * Note: Windfall tax would normally be collected under section 9.

### Part 4--Miscellaneous

##### 12  Annual report

   * After the end of each financial year, the Commissioner must give a report to the Minister, for presentation to the Parliament, on the operation of this Act during the year.

##### 13  Arrangements with States

   * (1) The Commissioner may make an arrangement with an appropriate officer or authority of a State about any matter in connection with the administration of this Act.

   * (2) In particular, an arrangement may relate to the Commissioner's delegation of powers or functions under this Act or the regulations.

     * Note: Section 8 of the _Taxation Administration Act 1953_ contains the Commissioner's delegation power.

##### 14  Regulations

   * (1) The Governor-General may make regulations prescribing matters:

    * (a) required or permitted by this Act to be prescribed; or

    * (b) necessary or convenient to be prescribed for carrying out or giving effect to this Act.

   * (2) In particular, the regulations may prescribe penalties for offences against the regulations by way of fines of up to 10 penalty units.
