   * **_APRA's financial claims scheme costs_** for a general insurer in relation to which Division 3 of Part VC of the _Insurance Act 1973_ applies or applied means the sum of:

    * (a) entitlements under that Division relating to the insurer; and

    * (b) the costs of the following:

     * (i) the administration of that Part in relation to the insurer;

     * (ii) the exercise of APRA's powers under that Part in relation to the insurer;

     * (iii) the performance of APRA's functions under that Part in relation to the insurer; and

    * (c) the costs of any borrowing under section 54E of the _Australian Prudential Regulation Authority Act 1998_ connected with the application of that Division in relation to the insurer.

   * **_general insurer_** has the same meaning as in the _Insurance Act 1973_.

   * **_levy_** means levy imposed under this Act.

##### 4  Regulations may impose levies

   * (1) In connection with the application of Division 3 of Part VC of the _Insurance Act 1973_ in relation to a general insurer, the regulations may impose levy on the gross premiums received by general insurers in a class prescribed by the regulations, in a financial year or other 12-month accounting period used instead of a financial year.

   * (2) The regulations must prescribe the class so as to exclude all general insurers in relation to which that Division applies.

##### 5  Amount of levy

   * (1) The amount of levy is the amount worked out in accordance with the regulations.

   * (2) However, the amount of levy on the gross premiums received by a general insurer cannot be more than 5% of the amount, worked out in accordance with the regulations, of those gross premiums.

   * (3) The regulations may prescribe:

    * (a) different ways of working out for the purposes of subsection (1) the amount of levy on gross premiums received by general insurers in different classes prescribed by the regulations; and

    * (b) different ways of working out for the purposes of subsection (2) the amounts of gross premiums received by general insurers in different classes prescribed by the regulations.

##### 6  Regulations

   * (1) The Governor-General may make regulations prescribing matters required or permitted by this Act to be prescribed.

   * (2) Before the Governor-General makes a regulation affecting the imposition or amount of a levy connected with the application of Division 3 of Part VC of the _Insurance Act 1973_ in relation to a general insurer, the Minister must be satisfied the regulation will help achieve the objective in subsection (3) of this section.

   * (3) The objective is that the total amount of levy connected with the application of that Division in relation to the insurer equal the excess of APRA's financial claims scheme costs for the insurer over the sum of amounts paid to APRA by the insurer in connection with that Part or in the winding up of the insurer.
