    * The following is a simplified outline of this Subdivision: 

     *  	There are rules about the number of jurors on a jury.

     *  	Not everyone on a jury roll is qualified to serve as a juror.

     *  	For each trial, the Sheriff convenes a jury panel by:

        * (a) selecting the jury district and preparing a jury list from the corresponding jury roll; and

        * (b) randomly selecting some of the persons on the jury list and summonsing them to attend court for jury service.

     * (b) on application by the respondent, the Court concludes that it is likely that, if judgment were to be given in favour of the representative party, the cost to the respondent of identifying the group members and distributing to them the amounts ordered to be paid to them would be excessive having regard to the likely total of those amounts;

     *  	The Court must also reconsider bail if the accused fails to comply with the accused's bail undertaking.
