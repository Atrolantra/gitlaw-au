      * (c) the association has at least 20 members who are employees; and

      * (d) the FWC is satisfied that the association would conduct its affairs in a way that meets the obligations of an organisation under this Act and the Fair Work Act; and

      * (f) the association does not have the same name as that of an organisation or a name that is so similar to the name of an organisation as to be likely to cause confusion; and

      * (g) the FWC is satisfied that a majority of the persons eligible to be members of the association support its registration as an organisation; and

     * (1A) For the purposes of paragraph (1)(b), if a person or body has an interest in the enterprise in question, the FWC may decide that, despite the interest, the association is free from control by, or improper influence from, the person or body.

         * Note: The FWC could conclude that the association was free from control etc. by the person if, for example, the nature of the person's interest was not such as to give the person a major say in the conduct of the enterprise or if the person did not have a significant management role in the association.

     * (2) In applying paragraph (1)(d), the FWC must have regard to whether any recent conduct by the association or its members would have provided grounds for an application under section 28 had the association been registered when the conduct occurred.

       * (vi) an order made under subsection 131(2) (which deals with contraventions of the withdrawal from amalgamation provisions).

     * (1A) The General Manager may apply to the Federal Court for an order cancelling the registration of an organisation on the ground that the organisation has failed to comply with an order of the Federal Court made under subsection 336(5) in relation to the organisation.

         * Note: Section 336 deals with the situation where the General Manager is satisfied, after an investigation, that a reporting unit of an organisation has contravened Part 3 of Chapter 8, or guidelines or rules relating to financial matters.

     * (2) An organisation in relation to which an application is made under subsection (1) or (1A) must be given an opportunity of being heard by the Court.

     * (3) If the Court:

      * (a) finds that a ground for cancellation set out in the application has been established; and

      * (b) does not consider that it would be unjust to do so having regard to the degree of gravity of the matters constituting the ground and the action (if any) that has been taken by or against the organisation in relation to the matters;

     * the Court must, subject to subsection (4) and section 29, cancel the registration of the organisation.

     * (4) If:

      * (a) the Court finds that a ground for cancellation set out in the application has been established; and

      * (b) that finding is made, wholly or mainly, because of the conduct of a particular section or class of members of the organisation;

      * (d) where persons belonging to the section or class are eligible for membership under an agreement of the kind referred to in section 151--declare that the persons are excluded from eligibility for membership in spite of anything in the agreement.

     * (5) If the Court cancels the registration of an organisation, the Court may direct that an application by the former organisation to be registered as an organisation is not to be dealt with under this Act before the end of a specified period.

      * (a) under section 23 or subsection 131(2) of this Act; or

      * (b) under Division 4 of Part 33 or Part 41 of the Fair Work Act; or

      * (c) under the Fair Work Act in relation to a contravention of Part 31 of that Act;

     * is admissible as prima facie evidence of that fact in an application made on a ground specified in paragraph (1)(d).

##### 29  Orders where cancellation of registration deferred

     * (1) If the Federal Court finds that a ground of an application under subsection 28(1) or (1A) has been established, the Court may, if it considers it just to do so, instead of cancelling the registration of the organisation concerned under subsection 28(3) or making an order under subsection 28(4), exercise one or more of the powers set out in subsection (2) of this section.

     * (2) The powers that may be exercised by the Court, by order, under subsection (1) are as follows:

      * (a) the power to suspend, to the extent specified in the order, any of the rights, privileges or capacities of the organisation or of all or any of its members, as such members, under this Act, the Fair Work Act or any other Act, under modern awards or orders made under this Act, the Fair Work Act or any other Act or under enterprise agreements;

      * (b) the power to give directions as to the exercise of any rights, privileges or capacities that have been suspended;

      * (c) the power to make provision restricting the use of the funds or property of the organisation or a branch of the organisation, and for the control of the funds or property for the purpose of ensuring observance of the restrictions.

     * (3) If the Court exercises a power set out in subsection (2), it must defer the determination of the question whether to cancel the registration of the organisation concerned until:

      * (a) the orders made in the exercise of the power cease to be in force; or

      * (b) on application by a party to the proceeding, the Court considers that it is just to determine the question, having regard to any evidence given relating to the observance or nonobservance of any order and to any other relevant circumstance;

     * whichever is earlier.

     * (4) An order made in the exercise of a power set out in subsection (2) has effect in spite of anything in the rules of the organisation concerned or a branch of the organisation.

     * (5) An order made in the exercise of a power set out in subsection (2):

      * (a) may be revoked by the Court, by order, on application by a party to the proceeding concerned; and

      * (b) unless sooner revoked, ceases to be in force:

       * (i) 6 months after it came into force; or

       * (ii) such longer period after it came into force as is ordered by the Court on application by a party to the proceeding made while the order remains in force.

##### 311  Civil proceedings after criminal proceedings

       * (i) the person or organisation has acted honestly; and

       * (ii) having regard to all the circumstances of the case, the person or organisation ought fairly to be excused for the contravention;

     * (3) If a person or organisation thinks that eligible proceedings will or may be begun against them, they may apply to the Federal Court for relief.

       * (i) the officer is or may be liable in respect of the negligence, default or breach; and

       * (ii) the officer has acted honestly; and

       * (iii) having regard to all the circumstances of the case (including those connected with the officer's appointment), the officer ought fairly to be excused for the negligence, default or breach;

     * the court may relieve the officer either wholly or partly from liability on the terms that the court thinks appropriate.

     * (2) An officer of an organisation who has reason to apprehend that a claim will or might be made against him or her for negligence, default, breach of trust or breach of duty in a capacity as such an officer may apply to the Federal Court for relief.
