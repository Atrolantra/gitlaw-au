      * (i) the GST that was collected;

      * (ii) the payments made to the Commissioner of Taxation representing amounts of GST that would have been payable if the Constitution did not prevent tax from being imposed on property of any kind belonging to a State and section 5 of the GST Imposition Acts had not been enacted;

      * (iii) the additional GST that would have been collected if the Commonwealth and Commonwealth entities could be made subject to taxation by a Commonwealth law and section 1771 of the GST Act made those entities actually liable rather than notionally liable; and
