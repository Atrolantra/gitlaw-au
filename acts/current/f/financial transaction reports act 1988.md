The amount of a penalty unit is stated in section 4AA of that Act.

    * (4) For the purposes of this Act, a failure by a person to produce a primary identification document shall not be taken to be sufficiently explained merely by the assertion that a primary identification document is not presently available to the person if the person could obtain a primary identification document within a reasonable time if the person took reasonable steps to obtain it.

    * (5) Nothing in subsection (4) shall be taken to require a person to apply for the issue of a citizenship certificate or a passport.
