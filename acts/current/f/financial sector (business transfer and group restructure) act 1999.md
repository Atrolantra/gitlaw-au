    * Either kind of transfer may be a partial transfer or a total transfer.

    * (2) A transfer of business of a regulated body, or of a body corporate related to a regulated body, is a **_partial transfer_** if it relates to some, but not all, of the transferring body's business (including any business that is not regulated business).

    * (3) A transfer of business of a regulated body, or of a body corporate related to a regulated body, is a **_total transfer_** if it relates to all of the transferring body's business (including any business that is not regulated business).

    * (4) For a voluntary transfer of business to take effect, APRA must:

     * (a) receive an application for the transfer from the regulated bodies concerned (the **_transferring body _**and the **_receiving body_**); and

     * (b) approve the application in writing (the**_ voluntary transfer approval_**); and

     * (c) issue a certificate (the **_certificate of transfer_**) stating that the transfer is to take effect.

    * The transfer of business takes effect when the certificate of transfer comes into force. 

    * (5) For a compulsory transfer of business to take effect, APRA must:

     * (a) make a determination (the **_compulsory transfer determination_**) that there is to be a transfer of business between the bodies concerned (the **_transferring body _**and the **_receiving body_**); and

     * (b) issue a certificate (the **_certificate of transfer_**) stating that the transfer is to take effect.

    * The transfer of business takes effect when the certificate of transfer comes into force. 

    * (6) Business of regulated bodies may also be transferred otherwise than under this Act, for example in accordance with section 63 of the _Banking Act 1959_ or Part 9 of the _Life Insurance Act 1995_.

    * (7) Part 4A deals with proposals by ADI, general insurer or life insurance company groups to restructure the group (under Part 5.1 of the _Corporations Act 2001_).

    * (5) The transfer of business takes effect when the certificate of transfer comes into force (see section 22).

##### Division 2--Approval of voluntary transfers

##### 10  Application for approval of voluntary transfer

    * (1) 2 regulated bodies of the same kind may apply in writing to APRA for approval of a transfer of business from one of the bodies to the other body. The transfer cannot relate only to business of the transferring body that is not regulated business.

    * (2) The application must be in the form prescribed by the transfer rules and must contain or be accompanied by the information required by the transfer rules.

      * Note: APRA may impose a charge in respect of the application--see section 51 of the _Australian Prudential Regulation Authority Act 1998_.

      * (ii) the Minister's consent to the transfer is not required (see section 15).

    * (2) APRA must not approve the transfer of business if it considers that the transfer should not be approved, having regard to provisions of another Act:

     * (a) that are prescribed for the purposes of subsection 43(4); or

     * (b) referred to in subsection 43(5), (6), (7) or (8).

    * (3) The voluntary transfer approval must be signed by an authorised APRA officer.

     * (b) the Australian Securities and Investments Commission; and

     * (c) the Commissioner of Taxation.

    * (3) APRA does not have to consult with the Australian Competition and Consumer Commission in relation to the transfer of business if the Commission has notified APRA, in writing, that it does not wish to be consulted about:

     * (a) the transfer; or

     * (b) a class of transfers that includes the transfer.

    * (4) APRA does not have to consult with the Australian Securities and Investments Commission in relation to the transfer of business if the Commission has notified APRA, in writing, that it does not wish to be consulted about:

    * (5) APRA does not have to consult with the Commissioner of Taxation in relation to the transfer of business if the Commissioner has notified APRA, in writing, that he or she does not wish to be consulted about:

     * (a) the transfer; or

     * (b) a class of transfers that includes the transfer.

##### 13  Adequate adoption

    * For the purposes of paragraph 11(1)(b), the transfer of business has been **_adequately adopted_** by a body if:

     * (a) the transfer has been adopted by or on behalf of the body, or by or on behalf of the members or a class of the members of the body, in a way prescribed by the transfer rules; and

     * (b) APRA considers that adoption of the transfer in that way adequately takes into account the interests of members of the body.

##### 14  Complementary State or Territory legislation

    * State or Territory legislation referred to in paragraph 11(1)(d) must include provision to ensure that, when a certificate of transfer comes into force under Division 3, the receiving body is taken to be the successor in law to the transferring body, to the extent of the transfer. In particular, the legislation must provide that:

     * (a) assets of the transferring body vest in the receiving body, to the extent of the transfer; and

     * (b) liabilities of the transferring body become liabilities of the receiving body, to the extent of the transfer; and

     * (c) the duties, obligations, immunities, rights and privileges applying to the transferring body apply to the receiving body, to the extent of the transfer; and

     * (d) if there is an approved section 20 statement in relation to the transfer that specifies:

      * (ii) a mechanism for determining things that are to happen or are taken to be the case--things determined in accordance with that mechanism are taken to happen, or to be the case, as determined in accordance with that mechanism.

##### 15  Minister's power to decide that his or her consent is not required

    * The Minister's consent to the transfer of business (see paragraph 11(1)(e)) is not required if the Minister has, in writing, determined that his or her consent is not required in relation to:

     * (a) the transfer; or

     * (b) a class of transfers that includes the transfer.

##### 16  Approval may impose conditions

    * (1) The voluntary transfer approval may impose conditions of either or both of the following kinds:

     * (a) conditions to be complied with by the transferring body or the receiving body before a certificate of transfer is issued in relation to the transfer of business;

     * (b) conditions to be complied with by the transferring body or the receiving body after a certificate of transfer has been issued or has come into force in relation to the transfer of business.

      * Note 1: Failure to comply with a condition referred to in paragraph (a) will mean that a certificate of transfer cannot be issued (see subsection 18(1)).

      * Note 2: Failure to comply with a condition referred to in paragraph (b) will not prevent the issue of a certificate of transfer, but will be an offence under subsection (4).

    * (2) The transferring body or the receiving body may apply in writing to APRA to have a condition that applies to it varied or revoked.

    * (3) APRA may, by notice in writing given to the body that made the application, approve the variation or revocation if it is satisfied that the variation or revocation is appropriate. A variation or revocation that is approved by APRA has effect accordingly.

    * (4) The transferring body or the receiving body is guilty of an offence if:

     * (a) a condition of a kind referred to in paragraph (1)(b) applies to that body; and

     * (b) that body fails to comply with the condition.

      *  Maximum penalty for contravention of this subsection: 200 penalty units.

      * Note 1: Chapter 2 of the _Criminal Code_ sets out the general principles of criminal responsibility.

      * Note 2: If a body corporate is convicted of an offence against this subsection, subsection 4B(3) of the _Crimes Act 1914_ allows a court to impose a fine of up to 5 times the penalty stated above.

##### 17  Notice of decision

    * (1) If APRA approves the transfer of business, APRA must give a copy of the voluntary transfer approval to the transferring body and the receiving body.

    * (2) If APRA refuses to approve the transfer of business, APRA must give written notice of the refusal to the transferring body and the receiving body. The notice must include a statement of the reasons why the approval was refused.

##### Division 3--Process by which voluntary transfers take effect

##### 18  Certificate of transfer

    * (1) If APRA:

     * (a) has made a voluntary transfer approval; and

     * (b) considers that all conditions of a kind referred to in paragraph 16(1)(a) that are imposed by the approval have been complied with; and

     * (c) if the transfer is a partial transfer--has been given a statement of detail in relation to the partial transfer (see section 19); and

##### 19  Partial transfer--statement of detail to be provided

    * If the transfer is a partial transfer, before APRA issues a certificate of transfer in relation to the transfer, APRA must be provided with a written statement:

     * (a) that lists, in detail, the assets and liabilities of the transferring body that are to be transferred to the receiving body; and

     * (b) that APRA is satisfied has been agreed to by the transferring body and the receiving body.

    * (9) For the purposes of section 50 and related provisions of the _Competition and Consumer Act 2010_ a transfer of business (whether voluntary or compulsory), or a transfer pursuant to an internal transfer certificate, that takes effect under this Act is taken to be:

     * (a) to the extent that the transfer is of shares in the capital of a body corporate--an acquisition of the shares by the receiving body; and

**Table A**


Application, saving or transitional provisions**

   * **_Tax Laws Amendment (Repeal of Inoperative Provisions) Act 2006 
   * _(No. 101, 2006)


##### Schedule 6

##### 1  Application of Schedule 1 and 2 amendments

   * Except as mentioned in items 2 and 3, the repeals and amendments made by Schedules 1 and 2 apply:

     * (a) so far as they affect assessments--to assessments for the 2006-07 income year and all later income years; and

     * (b) otherwise--to acts done or omitted to be done, or states of affairs existing, after the commencement of the repeals and amendments.

##### 6  Object

   * The object of this Part is to ensure that, despite the repeals and amendments made by this Act, the full legal and administrative consequences of:

     * (a) any act done or omitted to be done; or

     * (b) any state of affairs existing; or

     * (c) any period ending;

   * before such a repeal or amendment applies, can continue to arise and be carried out, directly or indirectly through an indefinite number of steps, even if some or all of those steps are taken after the repeal or amendment applies.

##### 7  Making and amending assessments, and doing other things, in relation to past matters

   * Even though an Act is repealed or amended by this Act, the repeal or amendment is disregarded for the purpose of doing any of the following under any Act or legislative instrument (within the meaning of the _Legislative Instruments Act 2003_):

     * (a) making or amending an assessment (including under a provision that is itself repealed or amended);

     * (b) exercising any right or power, performing any obligation or duty or doing any other thing (including under a provision that is itself repealed or amended);

   * in relation to any act done or omitted to be done, any state of affairs existing, or any period ending, before the repeal or amendment applies.

      * Example 1: On 31 July 1999, Greg Ltd lodged its annual return under former section 160ARE of the _Income Tax Assessment Act 1936_. The return stated that the company had a credit on its franking account and that no franking deficit tax was payable for the 1998-99 franking year. Under former section 160ARH of that Act, the Commissioner was taken to have made an assessment consistent with the return.

      * Following an audit undertaken after the repeal of Part IIIAA of that Act, the Commissioner concludes that Greg Ltd fraudulently overfranked dividends it paid during the 1998-99 franking year, and had a franking account deficit for that franking year. As a result, the Commissioner considers that franking deficit tax and a penalty by way of additional tax are payable.

      * The Commissioner can amend the assessment under former section 160ARN of that Act, because item 7 of this Schedule disregards the repeal of that section for the purposes of making an assessment in relation to the 1998-99 franking year. Item 7 will also disregard the repeal of Division 11 of former Part IIIAA to the extent necessary for the Commissioner to assess Greg Ltd's liability to a penalty by way of additional tax.

      * Despite the repeal of sections 160ARU and 160ARV, item 9 will ensure that the general interest charge will accrue on the unpaid franking deficit tax and penalty until they are paid.

      * Item 7 will also preserve Greg Ltd's right, under former section 160ART of that Act, to object against the Commissioner's amended assessment (including the penalty), since the objection is the exercise of a right in relation to a franking year that ended before the repeal of Part IIIAA.

      * Example 2: During the 1997-98 income year, Duffy Property Ltd withheld amounts from its employees' wages as required by former Divisions 1AAA and 2 of Part VI of the _Income Tax Assessment Act 1936_. The company failed to notify the Commissioner of those amounts, and failed to remit them to the Commissioner.

      * Following an audit undertaken after the repeal of those Divisions, the Commissioner discovers that the withheld amounts have not been remitted. The company's records are incomplete and the Commissioner is unable to completely ascertain the extent of its liability for the withheld amounts. Under section 222AGA of that Act, the Commissioner makes an estimate of the liability.

      * Item 7 will disregard the repeal of section 220AAZA of that Act (which empowered the Commissioner to recover the amount of the estimate). Even though the estimate is made after the repeal, it relates to amounts withheld before the repeal.

##### 8  Saving of provisions about effect of assessments

   * If a provision or part of a provision that is repealed or amended by this Act deals with the effect of an assessment, the repeal or amendment is disregarded in relation to assessments made, before or after the repeal or amendment applies, in relation to any act done or omitted to be done, any state of affairs existing, or any period ending, before the repeal or amendment applies.

##### 9  Saving of provisions about general interest charge, failure to notify penalty or late reconciliation statement penalty

   * If: 

     * (a) a provision or part of a provision that is repealed or amended by this Act provides for the payment of:

      * (i) general interest charge, failure to notify penalty or late reconciliation statement penalty (all within the meaning of the _Income Tax Assessment Act 1936_); or

      * (ii) interest under the _Taxation (Interest on Overpayments and Early Payments) Act 1983_; and

     * (b) in a particular case, the period in respect of which the charge, penalty or interest is payable (whether under the provision or under the _Taxation Administration Act 1953_) has not begun, or has begun but not ended, when the provision is repealed or amended;

   * then, despite the repeal or amendment, the provision or part continues to apply in the particular case until the end of the period.

##### 10  Repeals disregarded for the purposes of dependent provisions

   * If the operation of a provision (the **_subject provision_**) of any Act or legislative instrument (within the meaning of the _Legislative Instruments Act 2003_) made under any Act depends to any extent on an Act, or a provision of an Act, that is repealed by this Act, the repeal is disregarded so far as it affects the operation of the subject provision.

##### 11  Schedule does not limit operation of section 8 of the Acts Interpretation Act 1901

   * This Schedule does not limit the operation of section 8 of the _Acts Interpretation Act 1901_.

   * _Financial System Legislation Amendment (Financial Claims Scheme and Other Measures) Act 2008 _(No. 105, 2008)

##### Schedule 5

##### 19  Application

   * (1) The amendments of sections 8, 24 and 25 of the _Financial Sector (Business Transfer and Group Restructure) Act 1999_ made by this Schedule apply to the making of determinations on or after the commencement of this Schedule.

   * (2) Section 36AA of that Act applies in relation to contracts made after the commencement of this Schedule.

   * (3) The amendments of section 43 of that Act made by this Schedule apply in relation to transfers occurring on or after the commencement of this Schedule.

   * (4) The amendment of section 44 of that Act made by this Schedule applies to acquisitions of property occurring on or after the commencement of this Schedule.
