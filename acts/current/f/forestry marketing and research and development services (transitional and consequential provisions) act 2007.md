   * **_cessation time_** means the time when the FWPRDC ceases to exist because of the repeal of the _Forest and Wood Products Research and Development Corporation Regulations 1993_.

   * **_combined service period_**, in relation to a transferring employee, means the total of:

     * (a) the period that is, immediately before the cessation time, the employee's period of service for the purposes of the Long Service Leave Act; and

       * (iv) under which any right or liability accrues or may accrue to FWPRDC.

   * (2) The instrument continues to have effect after the cessation time as if a reference in the instrument to FWPRDC were a reference to the successor body.

   * (3) This item has effect despite section 147 of the _Primary Industries and Energy Research and Development Act 1989_.

   * (4) In this item:

   * **_instrument _**does not include regulations or any other instrument made under the _Superannuation Act 1976, _the _Superannuation Act 1990_ or the _Superannuation Act 2005_.

   * (2) The assets official may:

     * (a) deal with, and give effect to, the certificate as if it were a proper and appropriate instrument for transactions in relation to assets of that kind; and

     * (b) make such entries in the register as are necessary having regard to the effect of this Part.

   * (3) In this item:

   * **_assets official_** means the person or authority who, under a law of the Commonwealth, a State or a Territory, under a trust instrument or otherwise, has responsibility for keeping a register in relation to assets of the kind concerned.

     * (b) after that time the successor body must provide reasonable co-operation and assistance to enable the exercise of powers and performance of duties under that application of those sections.

   * Note: The main effects of paragraph (1)(a) are that sections 36, 37, 38, 39, 41 and 41A of the SRC Act apply in relation to the transferring employee's injury as if the Secretary of the Department were the rehabilitation authority and Comcare were the relevant authority.

   * (2) After the cessation time, the successor body is, for the purposes of section 40 of the SRC Act, taken to be the relevant employer of each transferring employee.

   * (3) After the cessation time, the successor body is, for the purposes of applying section 71 of the SRC Act in relation to each transferring employee, taken to be a Commonwealth authority.
