##### Subdivision E--Family dispute resolution

##### 60I  Attending family dispute resolution before applying for Part VII order

    * Object of this section

    * (1) The object of this section is to ensure that all persons who have a dispute about matters that may be dealt with by an order under this Part (a **_Part VII order_**) make a genuine effort to resolve that dispute by family dispute resolution before the Part VII order is applied for.

    * Phase 1 (from commencement to 30 June 2007)

    * (2) The dispute resolution provisions of the _Family Law Rules 2004_ impose the requirements for dispute resolution that must be complied with before an application is made to the Family Court of Australia for a parenting order.

    * (3) By force of this subsection, the dispute resolution provisions of the _Family Law Rules 2004_ also apply to an application to a court (other than the Family Court of Australia) for a parenting order. Those provisions apply to the application with such modifications as are necessary.

    * (4) Subsection (3) applies to an application for a parenting order if the application is made:

     * (a) on or after the commencement of this section; and

     * (b) before 1 July 2007.

    * Phase 2 (from 1 July 2007 to 30 June 2008)

    * (5) Subsections (7) to (12) apply to an application for a Part VII order in relation to a child if:

     * (a) the application is made on or after 1 July 2007 and before 1 July 2008; and

     * (b) none of the parties to the proceedings on the application has applied, before 1 July 2007, for a Part VII order in relation to the child.

    * Phase 3 (from 1 July 2008)

    * (6) Subsections (7) to (12) apply to all applications for a Part VII order in relation to a child that are made on or after 1 July 2008.

    * Requirement to attempt to resolve dispute by family dispute resolution before applying for a parenting order

    * (7) Subject to subsection (9), a court exercising jurisdiction under this Act must not hear an application for a Part VII order in relation to a child unless the applicant files in the court a certificate given to the applicant by a family dispute resolution practitioner under subsection (8). The certificate must be filed with the application for the Part VII order.

    * Certificate by family dispute resolution practitioner

    * (8) A family dispute resolution practitioner may give one of these kinds of certificates to a person:

     * (a) a certificate to the effect that the person did not attend family dispute resolution with the practitioner and the other party or parties to the proceedings in relation to the issue or issues that the order would deal with, but the person's failure to do so was due to the refusal, or the failure, of the other party or parties to the proceedings to attend;

     * (aa) a certificate to the effect that the person did not attend family dispute resolution with the practitioner and the other party or parties to the proceedings in relation to the issue or issues that the order would deal with, because the practitioner considers, having regard to the matters prescribed by the regulations for the purposes of this paragraph, that it would not be appropriate to conduct the proposed family dispute resolution;

     * (b) a certificate to the effect that the person attended family dispute resolution with the practitioner and the other party or parties to the proceedings in relation to the issue or issues that the order would deal with, and that all attendees made a genuine effort to resolve the issue or issues;

     * (c) a certificate to the effect that the person attended family dispute resolution with the practitioner and the other party or parties to the proceedings in relation to the issue or issues that the order would deal with, but that the person, the other party or another of the parties did not make a genuine effort to resolve the issue or issues;

     * (d) a certificate to the effect that the person began attending family dispute resolution with the practitioner and the other party or parties to the proceedings in relation to the issue or issues that the order would deal with, but that the practitioner considers, having regard to the matters prescribed by the regulations for the purposes of this paragraph, that it would not be appropriate to continue the family dispute resolution.

        * Note: When an applicant files one of these certificates under subsection (7), the court may take the kind of certificate into account in considering whether to make an order referring to parties to family dispute resolution (see section 13C) and in determining whether to award costs against a party (see section 117).

    * Exception

    * (9) Subsection (7) does not apply to an application for a Part VII order in relation to a child if:

     * (a) the applicant is applying for the order:

     * (b) subsection 60I(7) does not apply to the application because the court is satisfied that there are reasonable grounds to believe that:

      * (i) there has been abuse of the child by one of the parties to the proceedings; or

      * (ii) there has been family violence by one of the parties to the proceedings;

    * (2) Subsection (1) does not apply if the court is satisfied that there are reasonable grounds to believe that:

#### Division 2--Parental responsibility

##### 61A  What this Division does

    * This Division deals with the concept of parental responsibility including, in particular:

     * (a) what parental responsibility is; and

     * (b) who has parental responsibility.

##### 61B  Meaning of parental responsibility

    * In this Part, **_parental responsibility_**, in relation to a child, means all the duties, powers, responsibilities and authority which, by law, parents have in relation to children.

##### 61C  Each parent has parental responsibility (subject to court orders)

    * (1) Each of the parents of a child who is not 18 has parental responsibility for the child.

        * Note 1: This section states the legal position that prevails in relation to parental responsibility to the extent to which it is not displaced by a parenting order made by the court. See subsection (3) of this section and subsection 61D(2) for the effect of a parenting order.

        * Note 2: This section does not establish a presumption to be applied by the court when making a parenting order. See section 61DA for the presumption that the court does apply when making a parenting order.

        * Note 3: Under section 63C, the parents of a child may make a parenting plan that deals with the allocation of parental responsibility for the child.

    * (2) Subsection (1) has effect despite any changes in the nature of the relationships of the child's parents. It is not affected, for example, by the parents becoming separated or by either or both of them marrying or remarrying.

    * (3) Subsection (1) has effect subject to any order of a court for the time being in force (whether or not made under this Act and whether made before or after the commencement of this section).

        * Note: Section 111CS may affect the attribution of parental responsibility for a child.

##### 61D  Parenting orders and parental responsibility

    * (1) A parenting order confers parental responsibility for a child on a person, but only to the extent to which the order confers on the person duties, powers, responsibilities or authority in relation to the child.

    * (2) A parenting order in relation to a child does not take away or diminish any aspect of the parental responsibility of any person for the child except to the extent (if any):

     * (a) expressly provided for in the order; or

     * (b) necessary to give effect to the order.

##### 61DA  Presumption of equal shared parental responsibility when making parenting orders

    * (1) When making a parenting order in relation to a child, the court must apply a presumption that it is in the best interests of the child for the child's parents to have equal shared parental responsibility for the child.

        * Note: The presumption provided for in this subsection is a presumption that relates solely to the allocation of parental responsibility for a child as defined in section 61B. It does not provide for a presumption about the amount of time the child spends with each of the parents (this issue is dealt with in section 65DAA).

    * (2) The presumption does not apply if there are reasonable grounds to believe that a parent of the child (or a person who lives with a parent of the child) has engaged in:

     * (a) abuse of the child or another child who, at the time, was a member of the parent's family (or that other person's family); or

     * (b) family violence.

    * (3) When the court is making an interim order, the presumption applies unless the court considers that it would not be appropriate in the circumstances for the presumption to be applied when making that order.

    * (4) The presumption may be rebutted by evidence that satisfies the court that it would not be in the best interests of the child for the child's parents to have equal shared parental responsibility for the child.

##### 61DB  Application of presumption of equal shared parental responsibility after interim parenting order made

    * If there is an interim parenting order in relation to a child, the court must, in making a final parenting order in relation to the child, disregard the allocation of parental responsibility made in the interim order.

##### 61E  Effect of adoption on parental responsibility

    * (1) This section applies if:

     * (a) a child is adopted; and

     * (b) immediately before the adoption, a person had parental responsibility for the child, whether in full or to a limited extent and whether because of section 61C or because of a parenting order.

    * (2) The person's parental responsibility for the child ends on the adoption of the child, unless the adoption is by a prescribed adopting parent and leave was not granted under section 60G for the adoption proceedings to be commenced.

##### 61F  Application to Aboriginal or  Islander children

    * In: 

     * (a) applying this Part to the circumstances of an Aboriginal or Torres Strait Islander child; or

     * (b) identifying a person or persons who have exercised, or who may exercise, parental responsibility for such a child;

    * the court must have regard to any kinship obligations, and childrearing practices, of the child's Aboriginal or Torres Strait Islander culture.

#### Division 3--Reports relating to children under 18

##### 62A  What this Division does

    * This Division deals with the preparation of reports for use in proceedings relating to children who are under 18.

##### 62B  Court's obligation to inform people to whom Part VII orders apply about family counselling, family dispute resolution and other family services

    * If a court makes an order in proceedings under this Part, the court must inform the parties to the proceedings about the family counselling services, family dispute resolution services and other courses, programs and services available to help the parties adjust to the consequences of that order.

        * Note: Before informing the parties, the court must consider seeking the advice of a family consultant about the services appropriate to the parties' needs (see section 11E).

##### 62G  Reports by family consultants

    * (1) This section applies if, in proceedings under this Act, the care, welfare and development of a child who is under 18 is relevant.

    * (2) The court may direct a family consultant to give the court a report on such matters relevant to the proceedings as the court thinks desirable.

    * (3) If the court makes a direction under subsection (2), it may, if it thinks it necessary, adjourn the proceedings until the report has been given to the court.

    * (3A) A family consultant who is directed to give the court a report on a matter under subsection (2) must:

     * (a) ascertain the views of the child in relation to that matter; and

     * (b) include the views of the child on that matter in the report.

        * Note: A person cannot require a child to express his or her views in relation to any matter (see section 60CE).

    * (3B) Subsection (3A) does not apply if complying with that subsection would be inappropriate because of:

     * (a) the child's age or maturity; or

     * (b) some other special circumstance.

    * (4) The family consultant may include in the report, in addition to the matters required to be included in it, any other matters that relate to the care, welfare or development of the child.

    * (5) For the purposes of the preparation of the report, the court may make any other orders, or give any other directions, that the court considers appropriate (including orders or directions that one or more parties to the proceedings attend, or arrange for the child to attend, an appointment or a series of appointments with a family consultant).

        * Note: Before making orders under this section, the court must consider seeking the advice of a family consultant about the services appropriate to the parties' needs (see section 11E).

    * (6) If:

     * (a) a person fails to comply with an order or direction under subsection (5); or

     * (b) a child fails to attend an appointment with a family consultant as arranged in compliance with an order or direction under subsection (5);

    * the family consultant must report the failure to the court.

    * (7) On receiving a report under subsection (6), the court may give such further directions in relation to the preparation of the report as it considers appropriate.

    * (8) A report given to the court pursuant to a direction under subsection (2) may be received in evidence in any proceedings under this Act.

     * (a) to agree about matters concerning the child; and

     * (b) to take responsibility for their parenting arrangements and for resolving parental conflict; and

     * (c) to use the legal system as a last resort rather than a first resort; and

     * (d) to minimise the possibility of present and future conflict by using or reaching an agreement; and

     * (e) in reaching their agreement, to regard the best interests of the child as the paramount consideration.

        * Note: Parents are encouraged to reach an informal agreement between themselves about matters concerning their children by entering into a parenting plan. Parents who seek enforceable arrangements require court orders. These can be obtained by consent.

     * (a) is in writing; and

     * (b) is or was made between the parents of a child; and

     * (i) any aspect of the care, welfare or development of the child or any other aspect of parental responsibility for a child.

        * Note: Paragraph (f)--if the _Child Support (Assessment) Act 1989_ applies, provisions in a parenting plan dealing with the maintenance of a child (as distinct from child support under that Act) are unenforceable and of no effect unless the provisions in the plan are a child support agreement (see section 63CAA and subsection 63G(5) of this Act).

    * (2A) The person referred to in subsection (2) may be, or the persons referred to in that subsection may include, either a parent of the child or a person other than the parent of the child (including a grandparent or other relative of the child).

     * (d) whether it deals with other matters as well as matters mentioned in subsection (2).

        * Note: One of the other matters with which a parenting plan may deal is child support (see section 63CAA).

    * (4) Provisions of a parenting plan that deal with matters other than the maintenance of a child are **_child welfare provisions_**.

    * (5) Provisions of a parenting plan that deal with the matter mentioned in paragraph (2)(f) are **_child maintenance provisions_**.

    * (6) A **_registered parenting plan_** is a parenting plan:

    * (2) Subsection (1) does not affect the operation of the provisions for any other purpose.

        * Note: Section 60D deals with an adviser's obligations in relation to the best interests of the child.

    * (1) If an adviser gives advice or assistance to people in relation to parental responsibility for a child following the breakdown of the relationship between those people, the adviser must:

     * (a) inform them that they could consider entering into a parenting plan in relation to the child; and

     * (b) inform them about where they can get further assistance to develop a parenting plan and the content of the plan.

    * (2) If an adviser gives advice to people in connection with the making by those people of a parenting plan in relation to a child, the adviser must:

##### 65DAA  Court to consider child spending equal time or substantial and significant time with each parent in certain circumstances

    * Equal time

    * (1) Subject to subsection (6), if a parenting order provides (or is to provide) that a child's parents are to have equal shared parental responsibility for the child, the court must:

     * (a) consider whether the child spending equal time with each of the parents would be in the best interests of the child; and

     * (b) consider whether the child spending equal time with each of the parents is reasonably practicable; and

     * (c) if it is, consider making an order to provide (or including a provision in the order) for the child to spend equal time with each of the parents.

        * Note 1: The effect of section 60CA is that in deciding whether to go on to make a parenting order for the child to spend equal time with each of the parents, the court will regard the best interests of the child as the paramount consideration.

        * Note 2: See subsection (5) for the factors the court takes into account in determining what is reasonably practicable.

    * Substantial and significant time

    * (2) Subject to subsection (6), if:

     * (a) a parenting order provides (or is to provide) that a child's parents are to have equal shared parental responsibility for the child; and

     * (b) the court does not make an order (or include a provision in the order) for the child to spend equal time with each of the parents;

    * the court must: 

     * (c) consider whether the child spending substantial and significant time with each of the parents would be in the best interests of the child; and

     * (d) consider whether the child spending substantial and significant time with each of the parents is reasonably practicable; and

     * (e) if it is, consider making an order to provide (or including a provision in the order) for the child to spend substantial and significant time with each of the parents.

        * Note 1: The effect of section 60CA is that in deciding whether to go on to make a parenting order for the child to spend substantial time with each of the parents, the court will regard the best interests of the child as the paramount consideration.

        * Note 2: See subsection (5) for the factors the court takes into account in determining what is reasonably practicable.

    * (3) For the purposes of subsection (2), a child will be taken to spend **_substantial and significant time_** with a parent only if:

     * (a) the time the child spends with the parent includes both:

      * (i) days that fall on weekends and holidays; and

      * (ii) days that do not fall on weekends or holidays; and

     * (b) the time the child spends with the parent allows the parent to be involved in:

      * (i) the child's daily routine; and

      * (ii) occasions and events that are of particular significance to the child; and

     * (c) the time the child spends with the parent allows the child to be involved in occasions and events that are of special significance to the parent.

    * (4) Subsection (3) does not limit the other matters to which a court can have regard in determining whether the time a child spends with a parent would be substantial and significant.

    * Reasonable practicality

    * (5) In determining for the purposes of subsections (1) and (2) whether it is reasonably practicable for a child to spend equal time, or substantial and significant time, with each of the child's parents, the court must have regard to:

     * (a) how far apart the parents live from each other; and

     * (b) the parents' current and future capacity to implement an arrangement for the child spending equal time, or substantial and significant time, with each of the parents; and

     * (c) the parents' current and future capacity to communicate with each other and resolve difficulties that might arise in implementing an arrangement of that kind; and

     * (d) the impact that an arrangement of that kind would have on the child; and

     * (e) such other matters as the court considers relevant.

        * Note: Paragraph (c) reference to future capacity--the court has power under section 13C to make orders for parties to attend family counselling or family dispute resolution or participate in courses, programs or services.

    * Consent orders

    * (6) If:

     * (a) the court is considering whether to make a parenting order with the consent of all the parties to the proceedings; and

     * (b) the order provides (or is to provide) that a child's parents are to have equal shared parental responsibility for the child;

    * the court may, but is not required to, consider the matters referred to in paragraphs (1)(a) to (c) or (if applicable) the matters referred to in paragraphs (2)(c) to (e).

    * (7) To avoid doubt, subsection (6) does not affect the application of section 60CA in relation to a parenting order.

        * Note: Section 60CA requires the best interests of the child to be the paramount consideration in a decision whether to make a particular parenting order.

##### 65DAB  Court to have regard to parenting plans

    * When making a parenting order in relation to a child, the court is to have regard to the terms of the most recent parenting plan (if any) that has been entered into between the child's parents (to the extent to which that plan relates to the child) if doing so would be in the best interests of the child.

##### 65DAC  Effect of parenting order that provides for shared parental responsibility

    * (1) This section applies if, under a parenting order:

     * (a) 2 or more persons are to share parental responsibility for a child; and

     * (b) the exercise of that parental responsibility involves making a decision about a major longterm issue in relation to the child.

    * (2) The order is taken to require the decision to be made jointly by those persons.

        * Note: Subject to any court orders, decisions about issues that are not major longterm issues are made by the person with whom the child is spending time without a need to consult the other person (see section 65DAE).

    * (3) The order is taken to require each of those persons:

     * (a) to consult the other person in relation to the decision to be made about that issue; and

     * (b) to make a genuine effort to come to a joint decision about that issue.

    * (4) To avoid doubt, this section does not require any other person to establish, before acting on a decision about the child communicated by one of those persons, that the decision has been made jointly.

##### 65DAE  No need to consult on issues that are not major longterm issues

    * (1) If a child is spending time with a person at a particular time under a parenting order, the order is taken not to require the person to consult a person who:

     * (a) has parental responsibility for the child; or

     * (b) shares parental responsibility for the child with another person;

    * about decisions that are made in relation to the child during that time on issues that are not majorlong term issues.

        * Note: This will mean that the person with whom the child is spending time will usually not need to consult on decisions about such things as what the child eats or wears because these are usually not major longterm issues.

    * (2) Subsection (1) applies subject to any provision to the contrary made by a parenting order.

##### 65DA  Parenting orders

    * (1) This section applies when a court makes a parenting order.

    * (2) It is the duty of the court to include in the order particulars of:

     * (a) the obligations that the order creates; and

     * (b) the consequences that may follow if a person contravenes the order.

    * (3) If any of the persons to whom the order is directed is not represented by a legal practitioner, it is also the duty of the court to explain to the person, or to each of the persons:

     * (a) the availability of programs to help people to understand their responsibilities under parenting orders; and

     * (b) the availability and use of location and recovery orders to ensure that parenting orders are complied with.

    * (4) The court may cause to be prepared, and given to persons to whom a parenting order is directed, a document setting out particulars of the matters mentioned in paragraphs (3)(a) and (b).

    * (5) If a person to whom the order is directed is represented by a legal practitioner, the court may request the practitioner:

     * (a) to assist in explaining to the person the matters mentioned in paragraphs (2)(a) and (b); and

     * (b) to explain to the person the matters mentioned in paragraphs (3)(a) and (b).

    * (6) If a request is made by the court to a legal practitioner under paragraph (5)(a) or (b), it is the duty of the practitioner to comply with the request.

    * (7) Failure to comply with a requirement of, or with a request made under, this section does not affect the validity of a parenting order.

    * (8) Any matter that is required by this section to be included in a parenting order or any explanation that is required by this section to be given to a person is to be expressed in language that is likely to be readily understood by the person to whom the order is directed or the explanation is given.

##### 65F  General requirements for counselling before parenting order made

    * (2) Subject to subsection (3), a court must not make a parenting order in relation to a child unless:

     * (a) the parties to the proceedings have attended family counselling to discuss the matter to which the proceedings relate; or

     * (b) the court is satisfied that there is an urgent need for the parenting order, or there is some other special circumstance (such as family violence), that makes it appropriate to make the order even though the parties to the proceedings have not attended a conference as mentioned in paragraph (a); or

     * (c) the court is satisfied that it is not practicable to require the parties to the proceedings to attend a conference as mentioned in paragraph (a).

    * (3) Subsection (2) does not apply to the making of a parenting order if:

      * (i) the court; or

      * (ii) another court; or

      * (iii) a tribunal;

     * and draw any conclusions of fact from that transcript that it thinks proper; and

     * (b) adopt any recommendation, finding, decision or judgment of any court, person or body of a kind mentioned in any of subparagraphs (a)(i) to (iii).

        * Note: This subsection may be particularly relevant for Aboriginal or Torres Strait Islander children.

#### Division 13A--Consequences of failure to comply with orders, and other obligations, that affect children

##### Subdivision A--Preliminary

##### 70NAA  Simplified outline of Division

    * (1) This Division deals with the powers that a court with jurisdiction under this Act has to make orders to enforce compliance with orders under this Act affecting children.

    * (2) The court always has the power to vary the order under Subdivision B. In doing so, the court will have regard to any parenting plan that has been entered into since the order was made (see section 70NBB).

    * (3) The other orders that the court can make depend on whether:

     * (a) a contravention is alleged to have occurred but is not established (Subdivision C); or

     * (b) the court finds that a contravention has occurred but there is a reasonable excuse for the contravention (Subdivision D); or

     * (c) the court finds that there was a contravention and there is no reasonable excuse for the contravention (Subdivision E for less serious contraventions and Subdivision F for more serious contraventions).

##### 70NAB  Application of Division

    * Despite anything contained in any other provision of this Division, this Division does not apply in respect of a contravention, committed before this Division commences, of an order under this Act affecting children if a court made an order, in respect of that contravention before this Division commences, under this Act as previously in force.

##### 70NAC  Meaning of contravened an order

    * A person is taken for the purposes of this Division to have **_contravened_** an order under this Act affecting children if, and only if:

     * (a) where the person is bound by the order--he or she has:

      * (i) intentionally failed to comply with the order; or

      * (ii) made no reasonable attempt to comply with the order; or

     * (b) otherwise--he or she has:

      * (i) intentionally prevented compliance with the order by a person who is bound by it; or

      * (ii) aided or abetted a contravention of the order by a person who is bound by it.

        * Note: Parenting orders may be subject to any subsequent parenting plan (see section 64D). This means that an action that would otherwise contravene a parenting order may not be a contravention, because of a subsequent inconsistent parenting plan. Whether this is the case or not depends on the terms of the parenting order.

##### 70NAD  Requirements taken to be included in certain orders

    * For the purposes of this Division: 

     * (a) a parenting order that deals with whom a child is to live with is taken to include a requirement that people act in accordance with section 65M in relation to the order; and

     * (b) a parenting order that deals with whom a child is to spend time with is taken to include a requirement that people act in accordance with section 65N in relation to the order; and

     * (c) a parenting order that deals with whom a child is to communicate with is taken to include a requirement that people act in accordance with section 65NA in relation to the order; and

     * (d) a parenting order to which section 65P applies is taken to include a requirement that people act in accordance with that section in relation to the order.

##### 70NAE  Meaning of reasonable excuse for contravening an order

    * (2) A person (the **_respondent_**) is taken to have had a **_reasonable excuse for contravening_** an order under this Act affecting children if:

     * (a) the respondent contravened the order because, or substantially because, he or she did not, at the time of the contravention, understand the obligations imposed by the order on the person who was bound by it; and

     * (b) the court is satisfied that the respondent ought to be excused in respect of the contravention.

    * (3) If a court decides that a person had a reasonable excuse for contravening an order under this Act for the reason referred to in paragraph (2)(a), it is the duty of the court to explain to the person, in language likely to be readily understood by the person, the obligations imposed on him or her by the order and the consequences that may follow if he or she again contravenes the order.

    * (4) A person (the **_respondent_**) is taken to have had a reasonable excuse for contravening a parenting order to the extent to which it deals with whom a child is to live with in a way that resulted in the child not living with a person in whose favour the order was made if:

     * (a) the respondent believed on reasonable grounds that the actions constituting the contravention were necessary to protect the health or safety of a person (including the respondent or the child); and

     * (b) the period during which, because of the contravention, the child did not live with the person in whose favour the order was made was not longer than was necessary to protect the health or safety of the person referred to in paragraph (a).

    * (5) A person (the **_respondent_**) is taken to have had a reasonable excuse for contravening a parenting order to the extent to which it deals with whom a child is to spend time with in a way that resulted in a person and a child not spending time together as provided for in the order if:

     * (a) the respondent believed on reasonable grounds that not allowing the child and the person to spend time together was necessary to protect the health or safety of a person (including the respondent or the child); and

     * (b) the period during which, because of the contravention, the child and the person did not spend time together was not longer than was necessary to protect the health or safety of the person referred to in paragraph (a).

    * (6) A person (the **_respondent_**) is taken to have had a reasonable excuse for contravening a parenting order to the extent to which it deals with whom a child is to communicate with in a way that resulted in a person and a child not having the communication provided for under the order if:

     * (a) the respondent believed on reasonable grounds that not allowing the child and the person to communicate together was necessary to protect the health or safety of a person (including the respondent or the child); and

     * (b) the period during which, because of the contravention, the child and the person did not communicate was not longer than was necessary to protect the health or safety of the person referred to in paragraph (a).

    * (7) A person (the **_respondent_**) is taken to have had a reasonable excuse for contravening a parenting order to which section 65P applies by acting contrary to section 65P if:

     * (a) the respondent believed on reasonable grounds that the action constituting the contravention was necessary to protect the health or safety of a person (including the respondent or the child); and

     * (b) the period during which, because of that action, a person in whose favour the order was made was hindered in or prevented from discharging responsibilities under the order was not for longer than was necessary to protect the health or safety of the person referred to in paragraph (a).

##### 70NAF  Standard of proof

    * (1) Subject to subsection (3), the standard of proof to be applied in determining matters in proceedings under this Division is proof on the balance of probabilities.

    * (2) Without limiting subsection (1), that subsection applies to the determination of whether a person who contravened an order under this Act affecting children had a reasonable excuse for the contravention.

    * (3) The court may only make an order under:

     * (aa) paragraph 70NEB(1)(da); or

     * (ab) paragraph 70NECA(3)(a); or

     * (a) paragraph 70NFB(2)(a), (d) or (e); or

     * (b) paragraph 70NFF(3)(a);

    * if the court is satisfied beyond reasonable doubt that the grounds for making the order exist.

##### Subdivision B--Court's power to vary parenting order

##### 70NBA  Variation of parenting order

    * (1) A court having jurisdiction under this Act may make an order varying a primary order if:

     * (a) proceedings in relation to the primary order are brought before a court having jurisdiction under this Act; and

     * (b) it is alleged in those proceedings that a person committed a contravention of the primary order and either:

      * (i) the court does not find that the person committed a contravention of the primary order; or

      * (ii) the court finds that the person committed a contravention of the primary order.

    * (2) If Subdivision F applies to the contravention, when making an order under subsection (1) varying a primary order, the court, in addition to regarding, under section 60CA, the best interests of the child as the paramount consideration, must, if any of the following considerations is relevant, take that consideration into account:

     * (a) the person who contravened the primary order did so after having attended, after having refused or failed to attend, or after having been found to be unsuitable to take any further part in, a postseparation parenting program or a part of such a program;

     * (b) there was no postseparation parenting program that the person who contravened the primary order could attend;

     * (c) because of the behaviour of the person who contravened the primary order, it was not appropriate, in the court's opinion, for the person to attend a postseparation parenting program, or a part of such a program;

     * (d) the primary order was a compensatory parenting order made under paragraph 70NEB(1)(b) or 70NFB(2)(c) after the person had contravened a previous order under this Act affecting children.

    * (3) This section does not limit the circumstances in which a court having jurisdiction under this Act may vary a primary order.

##### 70NBB  Effect of parenting plan

    * (1) This section applies if:

     * (a) a parenting order has been made in relation to a child (whether before or after the commencement of this section); and

     * (b) after the parenting order was made, the parents of the child made a parenting plan that dealt with a matter (the **_relevant matter_**) that was dealt with in the parenting order.

    * (2) If:

     * (a) section 70NBA applies to proceedings brought in relation to the parenting order in relation to the relevant matter; and

     * (b) the parenting plan was in force when the contravention of the parenting order:

      * (i) is alleged to have been committed; or

      * (ii) occurred;

    * the court must, in exercising its powers under section 70NBA:

     * (c) have regard to the terms of the parenting plan; and

     * (d) consider whether to exercise its powers under section 70NBA to make an order varying the parenting order to include (with or without modification) some or all of the provisions of the parenting plan.

        * Note: An action that would otherwise contravene a parenting order may not be a contravention because of a subsequent inconsistent parenting plan. Whether this is the case or not depends on the terms of the parenting order (see section 64D).

    * This Subdivision applies if:

     * (b) on the most recent occasion on which the applicant brought proceedings of the kind referred to in paragraph (a), the court before which the proceedings were brought:

      * (i) was not satisfied that the respondent had committed a contravention of the primary order or that other primary order; or

      * (ii) was satisfied that the respondent had committed a contravention of the primary order or that other primary order but did not make an order under section 70NBA, 70NDB, 70NDC, 70NEB or 70NFB in relation to the contravention.

     * (a) the financial contribution made directly or indirectly by or on behalf of a party to the marriage or a child of the marriage to the acquisition, conservation or improvement of any of the property of the parties to the marriage or either of them, or otherwise in relation to any of that lastmentioned property, whether or not that lastmentioned property has, since the making of the contribution, ceased to be the property of the parties to the marriage or either of them; and

     * (b) the contribution (other than a financial contribution) made directly or indirectly by or on behalf of a party to the marriage or a child of the marriage to the acquisition, conservation or improvement of any of the property of the parties to the marriage or either of them, or otherwise in relation to any of that lastmentioned property, whether or not that lastmentioned property has, since the making of the contribution, ceased to be the property of the parties to the marriage or either of them; and

      * (i) the property of the parties to the marriage or either of them; or

      * (ii) the vested bankruptcy property in relation to a bankrupt party to the marriage;

     * if that significant change in financial circumstances occurs is more likely to do justice as between the parties to the marriage than an order that the court could make immediately with respect to: 

      * (iii) the property of the parties to the marriage or either of them; or

      * (iv) the vested bankruptcy property in relation to a bankrupt party to the marriage;

    * the court may, if so requested by either party to the marriage or the relevant bankruptcy trustee (if any), adjourn the proceedings until such time, before the expiration of a period specified by the court, as that party to the marriage or the relevant bankruptcy trustee, as the case may be, applies for the proceedings to be determined, but nothing in this subsection requires the court to adjourn any proceedings in any particular circumstances.

     * (a) is a contributor to a superannuation fund or scheme, or participates in any scheme or arrangement that is in the nature of a superannuation scheme; or

     * (b) may become entitled to property as the result of the exercise in his or her favour, by the trustee of a discretionary trust, of a power to distribute trust property;

    * but nothing in this subsection shall be taken to limit the circumstances in which the court may form the opinion that there is likely to be a significant change in the financial circumstances of a party to the marriage.

    * (8) Where, before property settlement proceedings are completed, a party to the marriage dies:

     * (b) if the court is of the opinion:

      * (i) that it would have made an order with respect to property if the deceased party had not died; and

      * (ii) that it is still appropriate to make an order with respect to property;

     * the court may make such order as it considers appropriate with respect to: 

      * (iii) any of the property of the parties to the marriage or either of them; or

      * (iv) any of the vested bankruptcy property in relation to a bankrupt party to the marriage; and

    * (10) The following are entitled to become a party to proceedings in which an application is made for an order under this section by a party to a marriage (the **_subject marriage_**):

     * (f) a payment flag is operating under Part VIIIB on a superannuation interest covered by the agreement and there is no reasonable likelihood that the operation of the flag will be terminated by a flag lifting agreement under that Part; or

     * (g) the agreement covers at least one superannuation interest that is an unsplittable interest for the purposes of Part VIIIB.

    * (1A) For the purposes of paragraph (1)(aa), **_creditor_**, in relation to a party to the agreement, includes a person who could reasonably have been foreseen by the party as being reasonably likely to become a creditor of the party.

    * (2) For the purposes of paragraph (1)(d), a person has **_caring responsibility_** for a child if:

     * (a) the person is a parent of the child with whom the child lives; or

     * (b) a parenting order provides that:

      * (i) the child is to live with the person; or

      * (ii) the person has parental responsibility for the child.

    * (3) A court may, on an application by a person who was a party to the financial agreement that has been set aside, or by any other interested person, make such order or orders (including an order for the transfer of property) as it considers just and equitable for the purpose of preserving or adjusting the rights of persons who were parties to that financial agreement and any other interested persons.

    * (4) An order under subsection (1) or (3) may, after the death of a party to the proceedings in which the order was made, be enforced on behalf of, or against, as the case may be, the estate of the deceased party.

    * (5) If a party to proceedings under this section dies before the proceedings are completed:

     * (a) the proceedings may be continued by or against, as the case may be, the legal personal representative of the deceased party and the applicable Rules of Court may make provision in relation to the substitution of the legal personal representative as a party to the proceedings; and

     * (b) if the court is of the opinion:

      * (i) that it would have exercised its powers under this section if the deceased party had not died; and

      * (ii) that it is still appropriate to exercise those powers;

     * the court may make any order that it could have made under subsection (1) or (3); and

     * (c) an order under paragraph (b) may be enforced on behalf of, or against, as the case may be, the estate of the deceased party.

    * (6) The court must not make an order under this section if the order would:

     * (a) result in the acquisition of property from a person otherwise than on just terms; and

     * (b) be invalid because of paragraph 51(xxxi) of the Constitution.

    * For this purpose, **_acquisition of property_** and **_just terms_** have the same meanings as in paragraph 51(xxxi) of the Constitution.

##### 90KA  Validity, enforceability and effect of financial agreements and termination agreements

    * The question whether a financial agreement or a termination agreement is valid, enforceable or effective is to be determined by the court according to the principles of law and equity that are applicable in determining the validity, enforceability and effect of contracts and purported contracts, and, in proceedings relating to such an agreement, the court:

     * (a) subject to paragraph (b), has the same powers, may grant the same remedies and must have the same regard to the rights of third parties as the High Court has, may grant and is required to have in proceedings in connection with contracts or purported contracts, being proceedings in which the High Court has original jurisdiction; and

     * (b) has power to make an order for the payment, by a party to the agreement to another party to the agreement, of interest on an amount payable under the agreement, from the time when the amount became or becomes due and payable, at a rate not exceeding the rate prescribed by the applicable Rules of Court; and

     * (c) in addition to, or instead of, making an order or orders under paragraph (a) or (b), may order that the agreement, or a specified part of the agreement, be enforced as if it were an order of the court.

### Part VIIIAB--Financial matters relating to de facto relationships

#### Division 1--Preliminary

##### Subdivision A--Meaning of key terms

##### 90RA  Participating jurisdictions

    * Participating jurisdictions

    * (1) For the purposes of this Act, the following are the **_participating jurisdictions_**:

     * (a) each referring State;

     * (b) each Territory.

    * Referring States

    * (2) A State is a **_referring State_** if:

     * (a) the Parliament of the State has referred, or refers, to the Parliament of the Commonwealth financial matters relating to the parties to de facto relationships arising out of the breakdown of those de facto relationships; and

     * (b) the referral of the financial matters is made:

      * (i) for the purposes of paragraph 51(xxxvii) of the Constitution; and

      * (ii) to the extent that the financial matters are not otherwise included in the legislative powers of the Parliament of the Commonwealth (otherwise than by a reference under paragraph 51(xxxvii) of the Constitution).

    * This subsection has effect subject to subsection (5).

    * (3) To avoid doubt, a State is not a **_referring State_** if its Parliament has referred, or refers, to the Parliament of the Commonwealth only a limited class of the matters referred to in paragraph (2)(a).

    * (4) A State is a **_referring State_** even if a law of the State provides that a reference to the Commonwealth Parliament described in subsection (2) is to terminate in particular circumstances.

    * (5) A State ceases to be a **_referring State_** if the State's reference to the Commonwealth Parliament described in subsection (2) terminates.

##### 90RB  Meaning of child of a de facto relationship

    * For the purposes of this Part, a child is a **_child of a de facto relationship_** if the child is the child of both of the parties to the de facto relationship.

        * Note: To determine who is a child of a person see Subdivision D of Division 1 of Part VII.

##### Subdivision B--Relationship with State and Territory laws

##### 90RC  Relationship with State and Territory laws

    * De facto financial provisions

    * (1) In this section:

    * **_de facto financial provisions_** means the following provisions:

     * (a) this Part;

     * (b) Part VIIIAA (as applied by section 90TA);

     * (c) Part VIIIB, to the extent to which it relates to a superannuation interest to be allocated between the parties to a de facto relationship;

     * (d) subsection 114(2A).

    * State and Territory laws do not apply to financial matters

    * (2) Parliament intends that the de facto financial provisions are to apply to the exclusion of any law of a State or Territory to the extent that the law:

     * (a) deals with financial matters relating to the parties to de facto relationships arising out of the breakdown of those de facto relationships; and

     * (b) deals with those matters by referring expressly to de facto relationships (regardless of how the State or Territory law describes those relationships).

        * Note 1: If, for example, both this Part and a law of a nonreferring State deal with the distribution of property between the parties to a de facto relationship that has broken down after the commencement of this section, then the parties can only seek to distribute the property under this Part. Subsection (2) has the effect of preventing the parties from seeking to distribute the property under the State law.

        * Note 2: For **_de facto relationship_**, see section 4AA.

    * Exception--insufficient link to a participating jurisdiction or Division 2 not applicable because of section 90SB

    * (3) Despite subsection (2), Parliament does not intend that the de facto financial provisions are to apply to the exclusion of a law of a State or Territory in relation to a financial matter relating to the parties to a de facto relationship arising out of the breakdown of the relationship if:

     * (a) a court cannot make an order under this Part in relation to that financial matter because of section 90SB, 90SD or 90SK; and

     * (b) there is no Part VIIIAB financial agreement that is binding on the parties dealing with that financial matter.

        * Example 1: Abbey and Bob are parties to a de facto relationship that has broken down, and have never been ordinarily resident in a participating jurisdiction. Subsection (3) has the effect that State law will govern financial matters arising out of the breakdown of their relationship.

        * Example 2: Cleo and Dan are parties to a de facto relationship that has broken down after the commencement of this section. Early in their relationship, they made a financial agreement under the law of a nonreferring State, but later spent most of their relationship in a participating jurisdiction. Cleo and Dan now have a sufficient geographical link with a participating jurisdiction for either of them to apply for an order under this Part in relation to financial matters arising out of the breakdown of their relationship. This means that subsection (3) will not apply and that their financial agreement will not be enforceable under State law because of subsection (2). However, their financial agreement will be enforceable under this Part as a Part VIIIAB financial agreement (see section 90UE).

    * Exception--laws facilitating this Act

    * (4) Despite subsection (2), Parliament does not intend that the de facto financial provisions are to apply to the exclusion of a law of a State or Territory to the extent that the law facilitates the operation of this Act.

        * Note: This Part is not intended to apply to the exclusion of, for example, a State law that deals with superannuation entitlements by acknowledging superannuation splitting under Part VIIIB of this Act.

    * Exception--prescribed State or Territory laws

    * (5) Despite subsection (2), Parliament does not intend that the de facto financial provisions are to apply to the exclusion of a law of a State or Territory if the law is prescribed in regulations made for the purposes of this subsection.

##### Subdivision C--Declarations about existence of de facto relationships

##### 90RD  Declarations about existence of de facto relationships

    * (1) If:

     * (a) an application is made for an order under section 90SE, 90SG or 90SM, or a declaration under section 90SL; and

     * (b) a claim is made, in support of the application, that a de facto relationship existed between the applicant and another person;

    * the court may, for the purposes of those proceedings (the **_primary proceedings_**), declare that a de facto relationship existed, or never existed, between those 2 persons.

    * (2) A declaration under subsection (1) of the existence of a de facto relationship may also declare any or all of the following:

     * (a) the period, or periods, of the de facto relationship for the purposes of paragraph 90SB(a);

     * (b) whether there is a child of the de facto relationship;

     * (c) whether one of the parties to the de facto relationship made substantial contributions of a kind mentioned in paragraph 90SM(4)(a), (b) or (c);

     * (d) when the de facto relationship ended;

     * (e) where each of the parties to the de facto relationship was ordinarily resident during the de facto relationship.

        * Note: For **_child of a de facto relationship_**, see section 90RB.

##### 90RE  Effect of declarations

    * (1) A section 90RD declaration has effect as a judgment of the court.

    * (2) For the purposes of this Act (other than Part VII), a section 90RD declaration has effect according to its terms.

##### 90RF  Applying for declarations

    * Any party to the primary proceedings may apply for a section 90RD declaration.

##### 90RG  Geographical requirement

    * A court may make a section 90RD declaration only if the court is satisfied that a person referred to in paragraph 90RD(1)(b), or both of those persons, were ordinarily resident in a participating jurisdiction when the primary proceedings commenced.

##### 90RH  Setting aside declarations

    * (1) If, in the primary proceedings, a person (the **_affected person_**) affected by a section 90RD declaration made in those proceedings applies under this subsection, and the court is satisfied that:

     * (a) a fact or circumstance has arisen that has not previously been disclosed to the court; and

     * (b) if the affected person was a party to the primary proceedings at the time the application for the declaration was made--the fact or circumstance was not within the affected person's knowledge at that time;

    * the court may do any of the following: 

     * (c) vary the declaration;

     * (d) set the declaration aside;

     * (e) set the declaration aside and make another section 90RD declaration in substitution for the declaration so set aside.

    * (2) The setting aside of a declaration does not affect anything done in reliance on the declaration while it remained in force.

    * (3) If the court sets aside a section 90RD declaration, the court may, on application by the affected person or any other interested person, make such order or orders (including an order for the transfer of property) as it considers just and equitable for the purpose of placing as far as practicable any person affected by the setting aside of the declaration in the same position as that person would have been in if the declaration had not been made.

#### Division 2--Maintenance, declarations of property interests and alterations of property interests

##### Subdivision A--Application of Division

##### 90SA  This Division does not apply to certain matters covered by binding financial agreements

    * (1) This Division does not apply to any of the following matters to which a Part VIIIAB financial agreement that is binding on the parties to the agreement applies:

     * (a) the maintenance of one of the spouse parties;

     * (b) the property of the spouse parties or of either of them;

     * (c) the financial resources of the spouse parties or of either of them.

    * (2) Subsection (1) does not apply in relation to:

     * (a) proceedings between:

      * (i) a party to a de facto relationship; and

      * (ii) the bankruptcy trustee of a bankrupt party to the de facto relationship;

     * with respect to the maintenance of the firstmentioned party after the breakdown of the de facto relationship; or

     * (b) proceedings between:

      * (i) a party to a de facto relationship; and

      * (ii) the bankruptcy trustee of a bankrupt party to the de facto relationship;

     * with respect to the distribution, after the breakdown of the de facto relationship, of any vested bankruptcy property in relation to the bankrupt party.

    * (3) Despite subsection (1), a party to a de facto relationship is not prevented from bringing property settlement proceedings under this Part if a Part VIIIAB financial agreement is not binding on that party.

        * Example: Before Amy and Ben's de facto relationship breaks down, Ben and Cathy make a Part VIIIAB financial agreement. Ben and Cathy's Part VIIIAB financial agreement does not prevent Amy from bringing property settlement proceedings against Ben.

##### 90SB  When this Division applies--length of relationship etc.

    * A court may make an order under section 90SE, 90SG or 90SM, or a declaration under section 90SL, in relation to a de facto relationship only if the court is satisfied:

     * (a) that the period, or the total of the periods, of the de facto relationship is at least 2 years; or

     * (b) that there is a child of the de facto relationship; or

     * (c) that:

      * (i) the party to the de facto relationship who applies for the order or declaration made substantial contributions of a kind mentioned in paragraph 90SM(4)(a), (b) or (c); and

      * (ii) a failure to make the order or declaration would result in serious injustice to the applicant; or

     * (d) that the relationship is or was registered under a prescribed law of a State or Territory.

        * Note: For **_child of a de facto relationship_**, see section 90RB.

##### 90SC  This Division ceases to apply in relation to a de facto relationship if the parties marry each other

    * (1) This Division (other than subsections 90SJ(2) to (5)) ceases to apply in relation to a de facto relationship if the parties to the de facto relationship later marry each other.

    * (2) Despite subsection (1), a declaration, order or injunction:

     * (a) made in property settlement proceedings under this Division in relation to the de facto relationship; and

     * (b) in force when the parties marry each other;

    * may, after the marriage, be enforced, varied or set aside in accordance with this Act.

    * (3) If a declaration, order or injunction is set aside as described in subsection (2), another declaration, order or injunction may be made under this Division in substitution for that declaration, order or injunction.

##### Subdivision B--Maintenance

##### 90SD  Geographical requirement

    * (1) A court may make an order under section 90SE or 90SG in relation to a de facto relationship only if the court is satisfied:

     * (a) that either or both of the parties to the de facto relationship were ordinarily resident in a participating jurisdiction when the application for the order was made (the **_application time_**); and

     * (b) that either:

      * (i) both parties to the de facto relationship were ordinarily resident during at least a third of the de facto relationship; or

      * (ii) the applicant for the order made substantial contributions, in relation to the de facto relationship, of a kind mentioned in paragraph 90SM(4)(a), (b) or (c);

     * in one or more States or Territories that are participating jurisdictions at the application time;

    * or that the alternative condition in subsection (1A) is met.

    * (1A) The alternative condition is that the parties to the de facto relationship were ordinarily resident in a participating jurisdiction when the relationship broke down.

    * (2) For the purposes of paragraph (1)(b), a State need not have been a participating jurisdiction during the de facto relationship.

    * (3) If each State is a referring State, the GovernorGeneral may, by Proclamation, fix a day as the day on which paragraph (1)(b), and the alternative condition in subsection (1A), cease to apply in relation to new applications.

        * Note: Paragraph (1)(b) and subsection (1A) will continue to apply in relation to applications made before the proclaimed day.

    * (4) If:

     * (a) a Proclamation under subsection (3) is in force; and

     * (b) a State ceases to be a referring State on a particular day;

    * the Proclamation is revoked by force of this subsection on and from that day.

    * (5) If, under subsection (4), a Proclamation under subsection (3) is revoked:

        * Note 1: The geographical requirement in section 90SD must be satisfied.

        * Note 2: The court must be satisfied of at least one of the matters in section 90SB.

    * the court must join the bankruptcy trustee as a party to the proceedings.

    * (3) If, under subsection (2), a bankruptcy trustee is a party to proceedings with respect to the maintenance of a party to a de facto relationship, then, except with the leave of the court, the bankrupt party to the de facto relationship is not entitled to make a submission to the court in connection with any vested bankruptcy property in relation to the bankrupt party.

    * (7) The court must not grant leave under subsection (6) unless the court is satisfied that there are exceptional circumstances.

    * (8) For the purposes of subsections (2) and (5), an application for an order under this section is taken to be finally determined when:

     * (a) the application is withdrawn or dismissed; or

     * (b) an order (other than an interim order) is made as a result of the application.

##### 90SF  Matters to be taken into consideration in relation to maintenance

    * (1) In exercising jurisdiction under section 90SE (after being satisfied of the matters in subsections 44(5) and (6) and sections 90SB and 90SD), the court must apply the principle that a party to a de facto relationship must maintain the other party to the de facto relationship:

     * (a) only to the extent that the firstmentioned party is reasonably able to do so; and

     * (b) only if the secondmentioned party is unable to support himself or herself adequately whether:

      * (i) by reason of having the care and control of a child of the de facto relationship who has not attained the age of 18 years; or

      * (ii) by reason of age or physical or mental incapacity for appropriate gainful employment; or

      * (iii) for any other adequate reason.

        * Note: For **_child of a de facto relationship_**, see section 90RB.

    * (2) In applying this principle, the court must take into account only the matters referred to in subsection (3).

    * (3) The matters to be so taken into account are:

     * (a) the age and state of health of each of the parties to the de facto relationship (the **_subject de facto relationship_**); and

     * (b) the income, property and financial resources of each of the parties and the physical and mental capacity of each of them for appropriate gainful employment; and

     * (c) whether either party has the care or control of a child of the de facto relationship who has not attained the age of 18 years; and

     * (d) commitments of each of the parties that are necessary to enable the party to support:

      * (i) himself or herself; and

      * (ii) a child or another person that the party has a duty to maintain; and

     * (e) the responsibilities of either party to support any other person; and

     * (f) subject to subsection (4), the eligibility of either party for a pension, allowance or benefit under:

      * (i) any law of the Commonwealth, of a State or Territory or of another country; or

      * (ii) any superannuation fund or scheme, whether the fund or scheme was established, or operates, within or outside ;

     * and the rate of any such pension, allowance or benefit being paid to either party; and

     * (g) a standard of living that in all the circumstances is reasonable; and

     * (h) the extent to which the payment of maintenance to the party whose maintenance is under consideration would increase the earning capacity of that party by enabling that party to undertake a course of education or training or to establish himself or herself in a business or otherwise to obtain an adequate income; and

     * (i) the effect of any proposed order on the ability of a creditor of a party to recover the creditor's debt, so far as that effect is relevant; and

      * (i) either or both of the parties to the de facto relationship; or

      * (ii) the relevant bankruptcy trustee (if any);

     * to make, for the benefit of either or both of the parties to the de facto relationship or a child of the de facto relationship, such settlement or transfer of property as the court determines.

        * Note 1: The geographical requirement in section 90SK must be satisfied.

        * Note 2: The court must be satisfied of at least one of the matters in section 90SB.

        * Note 3: For **_child of a de facto relationship_**, see section 90RB.

    * (3) The court must not make an order under this section unless it is satisfied that, in all the circumstances, it is just and equitable to make the order.

    * (4) In considering what order (if any) should be made under this section in property settlement proceedings, the court must take into account:

     * (a) the financial contribution made directly or indirectly by or on behalf of a party to the de facto relationship, or a child of the de facto relationship:

      * (i) to the acquisition, conservation or improvement of any of the property of the parties to the de facto relationship or either of them; or

      * (ii) otherwise in relation to any of that lastmentioned property;

     * whether or not that lastmentioned property has, since the making of the contribution, ceased to be the property of the parties to the de facto relationship or either of them; and

     * (b) the contribution (other than a financial contribution) made directly or indirectly by or on behalf of a party to the de facto relationship, or a child of the de facto relationship:

      * (i) to the acquisition, conservation or improvement of any of the property of the parties to the de facto relationship or either of them; or

      * (ii) otherwise in relation to any of that lastmentioned property;

     * whether or not that lastmentioned property has, since the making of the contribution, ceased to be the property of the parties to the de facto relationship or either of them; and

     * (c) the contribution made by a party to the de facto relationship to the welfare of the family constituted by the parties to the de facto relationship and any children of the de facto relationship, including any contribution made in the capacity of homemaker or parent; and

    * (5) Without limiting the power of any court to grant an adjournment in proceedings under this Act, if, in property settlement proceedings in relation to the parties to a de facto relationship, a court is of the opinion:

     * (a) that there is likely to be a significant change in the financial circumstances of the parties to the de facto relationship or either of them and that, having regard to the time when that change is likely to take place, it is reasonable to adjourn the proceedings; and

     * (b) that an order that the court could make with respect to:

      * (i) the property of the parties to the de facto relationship or either of them; or

      * (ii) the vested bankruptcy property in relation to a bankrupt de facto party to the de facto relationship;

     * if that significant change in financial circumstances occurs is more likely to do justice as between the parties to the de facto relationship than an order that the court could make immediately with respect to: 

      * (iii) the property of the parties to the de facto relationship or either of them; or

      * (iv) the vested bankruptcy property in relation to a bankrupt party to the de facto relationship;

    * the court may, if so requested by either party to the de facto relationship or the relevant bankruptcy trustee (if any), adjourn the proceedings until such time, before the expiration of a period specified by the court, as that party to the de facto relationship or the relevant bankruptcy trustee, as the case may be, applies for the proceedings to be determined, but nothing in this subsection requires the court to adjourn any proceedings in any particular circumstances.

    * (6) If a court proposes to adjourn proceedings as provided by subsection (5), the court may, before so adjourning the proceedings, make such interim order or orders or such other order or orders (if any) as it considers appropriate with respect to:

     * (a) any of the property of the parties to the de facto relationship or of either of them; or

     * (b) any of the vested bankruptcy property in relation to a bankrupt party to the de facto relationship.

    * (7) The court may, in forming an opinion for the purposes of subsection (5) as to whether there is likely to be a significant change in the financial circumstances of either or both of the parties to the de facto relationship, have regard to any change in the financial circumstances of a party to the de facto relationship that may occur by reason that the party to the de facto relationship:

     * (a) is a contributor to a superannuation fund or scheme, or participates in any scheme or arrangement that is in the nature of a superannuation scheme; or

     * (b) may become entitled to property as the result of the exercise in his or her favour, by the trustee of a discretionary trust, of a power to distribute trust property;

    * but nothing in this subsection limits the circumstances in which the court may form the opinion that there is likely to be a significant change in the financial circumstances of a party to the de facto relationship.

    * (8) If a party to the de facto relationship dies after the breakdown of the de facto relationship, but before property settlement proceedings are completed:

     * (a) the proceedings may be continued by or against, as the case may be, the legal personal representative of the deceased party and the applicable Rules of Court may make provision in relation to the substitution of the legal personal representative as a party to the proceedings; and

     * (b) if the court is of the opinion:

      * (i) that it would have made an order with respect to property if the deceased party had not died; and

      * (ii) that it is still appropriate to make an order with respect to property;

     * the court may make such order as it considers appropriate with respect to: 

      * (iii) any of the property of the parties to the de facto relationship or either of them; or

      * (iv) any of the vested bankruptcy property in relation to a bankrupt de facto party to the de facto relationship; and

     * (c) an order made by the court pursuant to paragraph (b) may be enforced on behalf of, or against, as the case may be, the estate of the deceased party.

    * (9) The Family Court must not make an order under this section in property settlement proceedings (other than an order until further order or an order made with the consent of all the parties to the proceedings) unless:

     * (a) the parties to the proceedings have attended a conference in relation to the matter to which the proceedings relate with a Registrar or Deputy Registrar of the Family Court; or

     * (b) the court is satisfied that, having regard to the need to make an order urgently, or to any other special circumstance, it is appropriate to make the order notwithstanding that the parties to the proceedings have not attended a conference as mentioned in paragraph (a); or

     * (c) the court is satisfied that it is not practicable to require the parties to the proceedings to attend a conference as mentioned in paragraph (a).

    * (10) The following are entitled to become a party to proceedings in which an application is made for an order under this section by a party to a de facto relationship (the **_subject de facto relationship_**):

     * (b) if the party is a debtor subject to a personal insolvency agreement--to the extent to which the debt is covered by the personal insolvency agreement.

     * (e) a proceeds of crime order has been made covering property of the parties to the de facto relationship or either of them, or a proceeds of crime order has been made against a party to the de facto relationship;

    * the court may, in its discretion, vary the order or set the order aside and, if it considers appropriate, make another order under section 90SM in substitution for the order so set aside.

        * Note: For **_child of a de facto relationship_**, see section 90RB.

    * (2) A court may, on application by a person affected by an order made by a court under section 90SM in property settlement proceedings, and with the consent of all the parties to the proceedings in which the order was made, vary the order or set the order aside and, if it considers appropriate, make another order under section 90SM in substitution for the order so set aside.

      * (i) it specifies an amount as a base amount in relation to the interest for the purposes of this Part;

      * (ii) it specifies a method by which such a base amount can be calculated at the time when the agreement is served on the trustee under section 90MI;

      * (iii) it specifies a percentage that is to apply to all splittable payments in respect of the interest; and

     * (b) otherwise--the amount is calculated in accordance with the regulations.

    * (5) Subject to section 90MV, this section continues to apply to the superannuation interest even if the agreement referred to in subsection (1) later ceases to be in force.

##### Subdivision C--Payment flagging

##### 90MK  Operative time for payment flag

    * (1) The **_operative time_** for a payment flag under a superannuation agreement is:

     * (b) otherwise, the beginning of the fourth business day after the day on which the service time occurs.

    * (2) In this section:

    * **_selfmanaged superannuation fund_** has the same meaning as in the SIS Act.

     * (b) a flag lifting agreement is served on the trustee as mentioned in section 90MI in respect of the superannuation interest.

    * (3) If a payment flag ceases to operate because of paragraph (2)(b), the cessation is not affected by a later termination of the flag lifting agreement.

    * (4) While a payment flag is operating on a superannuation interest, the trustee must not make any splittable payment to any person in respect of the interest.

      * Penalty: 50 penalty units.

        * Note: The penalty for a body corporate is 250 penalty units. See subsection 4B(3) of the _Crimes Act 1914_.

    * (4A) Subsection (4) does not apply if the splittable payment is made in circumstances in which section 90MLA applies.

        * Note: A defendant bears an evidential burden in relation to the matter in subsection (4A) (see subsection 13.3(3) of the _Criminal Code_).

    * (5) If a splittable payment becomes payable in respect of a superannuation interest while a payment flag is operating, the trustee must, within 14 days after it became payable, give written notice to the member spouse and the nonmember spouse.

      * Penalty: 50 penalty units.

        * Note: The penalty for a body corporate is 250 penalty units. See subsection 4B(3) of the _Crimes Act 1914_.

    * (7) If either spouse dies while a payment flag is operating:

     * (a) the payment flag nevertheless continues to operate; and

     * (b) the legal personal representative of the deceased spouse has all the rights the deceased spouse would have had in respect of the payment flag.

        * Note: The rights of the legal personal representative under paragraph (b) include the right to enter into a flag lifting agreement under section 90MN.

##### 90MLA  Some splittable payments payable if payment flag operating

    * (1) This section applies if:

     * (a) a superannuation interest (**_original interest_**) a person has in an eligible superannuation plan (**_old ESP_**) is identified in a superannuation agreement; and

     * (b) a payment flag under section 90ML is operating on the original interest; and

     * (c) a splittable payment is made by the trustee of the old ESP to the trustee of another eligible superannuation plan (**_new ESP_**) in respect of the original interest as part of a successor fund transfer.

    * (2) If this section applies, then:

     * (a) the new interest in the new ESP is taken to be the original interest identified in the superannuation agreement; and

     * (b) the payment flag operates on the new interest; and

     * (c) despite section 90MK, the operative time for the payment flag in respect of the new interest is the time that the payment to the trustee of the new ESP is made.

    * (3) In this section:

    * **_successor fund transfer_** means the transfer of a person's superannuation interest in the old ESP in circumstances where:

     * (a) the new ESP confers on the person, in relation to the new interest, equivalent rights to the rights the person had in relation to the original interest; and

     * (b) before the transfer, the trustee of the new ESP had agreed with the trustee of the old ESP to the conferral of such rights.

##### 90MM  Payment flag may be terminated by court

    * (1) If a court makes an order under section 90K setting aside a financial agreement in respect of which a payment flag is operating, the court may also make an order terminating the operation of the flag.

        * Note: Under section 90MH, a superannuation agreement must be part of a financial agreement. Therefore, setting aside the financial agreement also has the effect of setting aside the superannuation agreement.

    * (2) If a court makes an order under section 90UM setting aside a Part VIIIAB financial agreement in respect of which a payment flag is operating, the court may also make an order terminating the operation of the flag.

        * Note: Under section 90MHA, a superannuation agreement relating to a de facto relationship must be part of a Part VIIIAB financial agreement. Therefore, setting aside the financial agreement also has the effect of setting aside the superannuation agreement.

##### 90MN  Flag lifting agreement etc.

    * (1) At any time when a payment flag is operating on a superannuation interest, the spouses may make an agreement (a **_flag lifting agreement_**) that either:

     * (a) provides that the flag is to cease operating without any payment split; or

     * (b) specifies an amount, method or percentage in accordance with subsection 90MJ(1).

    * (2) If the flag lifting agreement provides for a payment split, the spouses may at any time make an agreement (a **_termination agreement_**) that terminates the flag lifting agreement.

    * (3) A flag lifting agreement or termination agreement has no effect unless it complies with the following requirements:

     * (a) the agreement must be signed by both spouses;

     * (b) for each spouse, the agreement must contain a statement that the spouse has been provided with independent legal advice from a legal practitioner as to the legal effect of the agreement;

     * (c) a certificate must be attached to the agreement, signed by the person who provided the legal advice and stating that the advice was provided;

     * (d) after the agreement is signed by the spouses, each spouse must be provided with a copy of the agreement.

     * (a) if the spouses are parties to a marriage--any of the grounds set out in subsection 90K(1) (other than paragraph 90K(1)(f)); or

     * (b) if the spouses are parties to a de facto relationship--any of the grounds set out in subsection 90UM(1) (other than paragraph 90UM(1)(i)).

    * (5) An order setting aside a flag lifting agreement also operates to set aside the related financial agreement or Part VIIIAB financial agreement.

    * (6) An order under section 90K setting aside a financial agreement also operates to set aside the related flag lifting agreement.

    * (7) An order under section 90UM setting aside a Part VIIIAB financial agreement also operates to set aside the related flag lifting agreement.

##### Subdivision D--Miscellaneous

##### 90MT  Splitting order

    * (1) A court, in accordance with section 90MS, may make the following orders in relation to a superannuation interest (other than an unsplittable interest):

     * (a) if the interest is not a percentageonly interest--an order to the effect that, whenever a splittable payment becomes payable in respect of the interest:

      * (i) the nonmember spouse is entitled to be paid the amount (if any) calculated in accordance with the regulations; and

      * (ii) there is a corresponding reduction in the entitlement of the person to whom the splittable payment would have been made but for the order;

     * (b) an order to the effect that, whenever a splittable payment becomes payable in respect of the interest:

      * (i) the nonmember spouse is entitled to be paid a specified percentage of the splittable payment; and

      * (ii) there is a corresponding reduction in the entitlement of the person to whom the splittable payment would have been made but for the order;

      * (i) the nonmember spouse is entitled to be paid the amount (if any) calculated in accordance with the regulations by reference to the percentage specified in the order;

      * (ii) there is a corresponding reduction in the entitlement of the person to whom the splittable payment would have been made but for the order;

     * (d) such other orders as the court thinks necessary for the enforcement of an order under paragraph (a), (b) or (c).

     * (b) otherwise, the court must determine the value of the interest by such method as the court considers appropriate.

    * (2A) The amount determined under paragraph (2)(a) is taken to be the value of the interest.

    * (3) Regulations for the purposes of paragraph (2)(a) may provide for the amount to be determined wholly or partly by reference to methods or factors that are approved in writing by the Minister for the purposes of the regulations.

    * (4) Before making an order referred to in paragraph (1)(a), the court must allocate a base amount to the nonmember spouse, not exceeding the value determined under subsection (2).

     * (b) requiring the trustee to notify the member spouse and the nonmember spouse, within a period specified in the order, of the next occasion when a splittable payment becomes payable in respect of the interest.

    * (2) In deciding whether to make an order in accordance with this section, the court may take into account such matters as it considers relevant and, in particular, may take into account the likelihood that a splittable payment will soon become payable in respect of the superannuation interest.

##### 90MUA  Some splittable payments may be made without leave of court

    * (1) A flagging order made under subsection 90MU(1) in relation to a superannuation interest (**_original interest_**) a person has in an eligible superannuation plan (**_old ESP_**) does not apply to a splittable payment if the splittable payment is made by the trustee of the old ESP to the trustee of another eligible superannuation plan (**_new ESP_**) in respect of the original interest as part of a successor fund transfer.

    * (2) If the splittable payment is made, then the flagging order is taken to be made in relation to the new interest from the time that the payment to the trustee of the new ESP is made.

    * (3) In this section:

    * **_successor fund transfer_** means the transfer of a person's superannuation interest in the old ESP in circumstances where:

     * (a) the new ESP confers on the person, in relation to the new interest, equivalent rights to the rights the person had in relation to the original interest; and

     * (b) before the transfer, the trustee of the new ESP had agreed with the trustee of the old ESP to the conferral of such rights.

#### Division 4--General provisions about payment splitting

##### 90MV  Court may cancel payment split

    * (1) A court may, under section 79 or 90SM, make an order terminating the operation of a payment split if:

     * (a) the superannuation agreement in respect of the payment split has ceased to be in force; and

     * (b) the nonmember spouse has not served a waiver notice on the trustee under section 90MZA in respect of the payment split.

    * (2) The termination has effect for splittable payments that become payable after the date specified in the order.

##### 90MW  Deductions from splittable payment before calculating payment split

    * Any deduction that the trustee is entitled to make from a splittable payment is to be deducted from the splittable payment before calculating any payment split and before applying section 90MX.

##### 90MX  Multiple payment splits applying to the same splittable payment

    * (1) This section applies if 2 or more payment splits apply to the same splittable payment.

    * (2) The payments splits are to be calculated in order of their operative times, starting with the earliest time.

    * (3) For the purpose of calculating each of those payment splits (other than the one with the earliest operative time), the amount of the splittable payment is taken to be reduced by the amount to which a person other than the member spouse is entitled under the payment split with the next earlier operative time.

        * Example 1: W has a superannuation interest that is subject to 3 payment splits in respect of W's marriages to X, Y and Z (in that order). The operative times of the payment splits are in the same order as the marriages. Assume each payment split provides for a 50% share to the nonmember spouse. W becomes entitled to a splittable payment of $100. The final payment entitlements are as follows: X gets $50. Y gets $25. Z gets $12.50. W gets the remaining $12.50.

        * Example 2: W has a superannuation interest that is subject to 3 payment splits in respect of W's de facto relationship with X, W's marriage to Y and W's de facto relationship with Z (in that order). The operative times of the payment splits are in the same order as the relationships. Assume each payment split provides for a 50% share to the nonmember spouse. W becomes entitled to a splittable payment of $100. The final payment entitlements are as follows: X gets $50. Y gets $25. Z gets $12.50. W gets the remaining $12.50.

##### 90MY  Fees payable to trustee

    * (1) The regulations may:

     * (a) allow trustees to charge reasonable fees:

      * (i) in respect of a payment split; or

      * (ii) otherwise in respect of the operation of this Part in relation to a superannuation interest; and

     * (b) prescribe the person or persons liable to pay those fees.

    * (2) If any such fee remains unpaid after the time it is due for payment, then the trustee may recover any unpaid amount by deduction from amounts that would otherwise become payable by the trustee, in respect of the superannuation interest, to the person who is liable to pay the fee.

##### 90MZ  Superannuation preservation requirements

    * (1) If the eligible superannuation plan for a payment split is a regulated superannuation fund or approved deposit fund, then the entitlement of the nonmember spouse is subject to any regulations made under the SIS Act that provide for payment of that entitlement to a regulated superannuation fund, approved deposit fund, RSA or exempt public sector superannuation scheme within the meaning of the SIS Act for the benefit of the nonmember spouse.

    * (2) If the eligible superannuation plan for a payment split is an RSA, then the entitlement of the nonmember spouse is subject to any regulations made under the _Retirement Savings Accounts Act 1997_ that provide for payment of that entitlement to a regulated superannuation fund, approved deposit fund, RSA or exempt public sector superannuation scheme within the meaning of the SIS Act for the benefit of the nonmember spouse.

    * (3) If the eligible superannuation plan for a payment split is a constitutionally protected fund (within the meaning of the _Income Tax Assessment Act 1997_) or an exempt public sector superannuation scheme within the meaning of the SIS Act, then the entitlement of the nonmember spouse is subject to any law or other instrument that provides for payment of that entitlement to a regulated superannuation fund, approved deposit fund, RSA or exempt public sector superannuation scheme within the meaning of the SIS Act for the benefit of the nonmember spouse.

##### 90MZA  Waiver of rights under payment split

    * (1) If the nonmember spouse serves a waiver notice on the trustee in respect of a payment split, then the following provisions apply for each splittable payment that becomes payable after the date specified in the waiver notice:

     * (a) the nonmember spouse is not entitled to be paid any amount under the payment split in respect of the splittable payment;

     * (b) the entitlement of the person to whom the splittable payment would have been made but for the payment split continues to be reduced in the same way as it would have been reduced if the entitlement of the nonmember spouse had not been terminated.

        * Example: X has a superannuation interest that is subject to a 50:50 payment split in favour of Y. Y serves a waiver notice on the trustee, in exchange for a lump sum payment made by the trustee to another fund for the benefit of Y. The effect is that X's payments will continue to be reduced by half, but Y will receive no further payments under the payment split.

    * (2) To be effective for the purposes of this section, a waiver notice must be in the prescribed form and must be accompanied by:

     * (a) a statement to the effect that the nonmember spouse has been provided with independent financial advice from a prescribed financial adviser as to the financial effect of the waiver notice; and

     * (b) a certificate signed by the person who provided the financial advice, stating that the advice was provided.

##### 90MZB  Trustee to provide information

    * (2) The application must be accompanied by:

     * (a) a declaration, in the prescribed form, stating that the applicant requires the information for either or both of the following purposes:

      * (i) to assist the applicant to properly negotiate a superannuation agreement;

      * (ii) to assist the applicant in connection with the operation of this Part in relation to the applicant; and

     * (b) the fee (if any) payable under regulations made for the purposes of section 90MY.

    * (3) If the trustee receives an application that complies with this section, the trustee must, in accordance with the regulations, provide information about the superannuation interest to the applicant.

      * Penalty: 50 penalty units.

        * Note: The penalty for a body corporate is 250 penalty units. See subsection 4B(3) of the _Crimes Act 1914_.

    * (4) Regulations for the purposes of subsection (3) may specify circumstances in which the trustee is not required to provide information.

        * Example: The regulations might provide that a secondary government trustee is not required to provide information where there is another trustee of the eligible superannuation plan who is better able to provide the information.

    * (5) The trustee must not, in response to an application under this section by a spouse of the member, provide the spouse with any address of the member. For this purpose, **_address_** includes a postal address.

      * Penalty: 50 penalty units.

        * Note: The penalty for a body corporate is 250 penalty units. See subsection 4B(3) of the _Crimes Act 1914_.

    * (6) If the trustee receives an application under this section from a person other than the member, the trustee must not inform the member that the application has been received.

_Article 7_

_1	In case of wrongful removal or retention of the child, the authorities of the Contracting State in which the child was habitually resident immediately before the removal or retention keep their jurisdiction until the child has acquired a habitual residence in another State, and

_a_	each person, institution or other body having rights of custody has acquiesced in the removal or retention; or

_b_	the child has resided in that other State for a period of at least one year after the person, institution or other body having rights of custody has or should have had knowledge of the whereabouts of the child, no request for return lodged within that period is still pending, and the child is settled in his or her new environment.

2	The removal or the retention of a child is to be considered wrongful where--

_a_	it is in breach of rights of custody attributed to a person, an institution or any other body, either jointly or alone, under the law of the State in which the child was habitually resident immediately before the removal or retention; and

_b_	at the time of removal or retention those rights were actually exercised, either jointly or alone, or would have been so exercised but for the removal or retention.

The rights of custody mentioned in subparagraph _a _above, may arise in particular by operation of law or by reason of a judicial or administrative decision, or by reason of an agreement having legal effect under the law of that State.

3	So long as the authorities first mentioned in paragraph 1 keep their jurisdiction, the authorities of the  to which the child has been removed or in which he or she has been retained can take only such urgent measures under Article 11 as are necessary for the protection of the person or property of the child.

_Article 8_

_1	By way of exception, the authority of a Contracting State having jurisdiction under Article 5 or 6, if it considers that the authority of another Contracting State would be better placed in the particular case to assess the best interests of the child, may either

--	request that other authority, directly or with the assistance of the Central Authority of its State, to assume jurisdiction to take such measures of protection as it considers to be necessary, or

--	suspend consideration of the case and invite the parties to introduce such a request before the authority of that other State.

_d_	a State with which the child has a substantial connection.

3	The authorities concerned may proceed to an exchange of views.

4	The authority addressed as provided in paragraph 1 may assume jurisdiction, in place of the authority having jurisdiction under Article 5 or 6, if it considers that this is in the child's best interests.

_Article 9_

_1	If the authorities of a  referred to in Article 8, paragraph 2, consider that they are better placed in the particular case to assess the child's best interests, they may either

--	request the competent authority of the  of the habitual residence of the child, directly or with the assistance of the Central Authority of that State, that they be authorised to exercise jurisdiction to take the measures of protection which they consider to be necessary, or

--	invite the parties to introduce such a request before the authority of the  of the habitual residence of the child.

2	The authorities concerned may proceed to an exchange of views.

3	The authority initiating the request may exercise jurisdiction in place of the authority of the  of the habitual residence of the child only if the latter authority has accepted the request.

_Article 10_

_1	Without prejudice to Articles 5 to 9, the authorities of a Contracting State exercising jurisdiction to decide upon an application for divorce or legal separation of the parents of a child habitually resident in another Contracting State, or for annulment of their marriage, may, if the law of their State so provides, take measures directed to the protection of the person or property of such child if

_a_	at the time of commencement of the proceedings, one of his or her parents habitually resides in that State and one of them has parental responsibility in relation to the child, and

_b_	the jurisdiction of these authorities to take such measures has been accepted by the parents, as well as by any other person who has parental responsibility in relation to the child, and is in the best interests of the child.

2	The jurisdiction provided for by paragraph 1 to take measures for the protection of the child ceases as soon as the decision allowing or refusing the application for divorce, legal separation or annulment of the marriage has become final, or the proceedings have come to an end for another reason.

_1	In all cases of urgency, the authorities of any Contracting State in whose territory the child or property belonging to the child is present have jurisdiction to take any necessary measures of protection.

_1	The authorities of a Contracting State which have jurisdiction under Articles 5 to 10 to take measures for the protection of the person or property of the child must abstain from exercising this jurisdiction if, at the time of the commencement of the proceedings, corresponding measures have been requested from the authorities of another Contracting State having jurisdiction under Articles 5 to 10 at the time of the request and are still under consideration.

2	The provisions of the preceding paragraph shall not apply if the authorities before whom the request for measures was initially introduced have declined jurisdiction.

_Article 14_

_The measures taken in application of Articles 5 to 10 remain in force according to their terms, even if a change of circumstances has eliminated the basis upon which jurisdiction was founded, so long as the authorities which have jurisdiction under the Convention have not modified, replaced or terminated such measures.

CHAPTER III--APPLICABLE LAW

_Article 15_

_1	In exercising their jurisdiction under the provisions of Chapter II, the authorities of the Contracting States shall apply their own law.

2	However, in so far as the protection of the person or the property of the child requires, they may exceptionally apply or take into consideration the law of another State with which the situation has a substantial connection.

3	Parental responsibility which exists under the law of the State of the child's habitual residence subsists after a change of that habitual residence to another State.

4	If the child's habitual residence changes, the attribution of parental responsibility by operation of law to a person who does not already have such responsibility is governed by the law of the State of the new habitual residence.

_Article 17_

_Article 18_

_The parental responsibility referred to in Article 16 may be terminated, or the conditions of its exercise modified, by measures taken under this Convention.

_Article 19_

_1	The validity of a transaction entered into between a third party and another person who would be entitled to act as the child's legal representative under the law of the State where the transaction was concluded cannot be contested, and the third party cannot be held liable, on the sole ground that the other person was not entitled to act as the child's legal representative under the law designated by the provisions of this Chapter, unless the third party knew or should have known that the parental responsibility was governed by the latter law.

2	The preceding paragraph applies only if the transaction was entered into between persons present on the territory of the same State.

_Article 20_

_The provisions of this Chapter apply even if the law designated by them is the law of a nonContracting .

_Article 21_

_1	In this Chapter the term "law" means the law in force in a State other than its choice of law rules.

2	However, if the law applicable according to Article 16 is that of a nonContracting  and if the choice of law rules of that State designate the law of another nonContracting  which would apply its own law, the law of the latter State applies. If that other nonContracting  would not apply its own law, the applicable law is that designated by Article 16.

_Article 22_

_The application of the law designated by the provisions of this Chapter can be refused only if this application would be manifestly contrary to public policy, taking into account the best interests of the child.

_c_	on the request of any person claiming that the measure infringes his or her parental responsibility, if such measure was taken, except in a case of urgency, without such person having been given an opportunity to be heard;

_d_	if such recognition is manifestly contrary to public policy of the requested State, taking into account the best interests of the child;

_e_	if the measure is incompatible with a later measure taken in the nonContracting  of the habitual residence of the child, where this later measure fulfils the requirements for recognition in the requested State;

_f_	if the procedure provided in Article 33 has not been complied with.

_Article 24_

_Without prejudice to Article 23, paragraph 1, any interested person may request from the competent authorities of a  that they decide on the recognition or nonrecognition of a measure taken in another . The procedure is governed by the law of the requested State.
