    * This Act also requires the industry services body to comply with directions given by the Minister in the national interest because of an emergency.

       * Note: The first industry services body has the assets, liabilities and staff of the Forest and Wood Products Research and Development Corporation transferred to it by the _Forestry Marketing and Research and Development Services (Transitional and Consequential Provisions) Act 2007_.

##### 7  Simplified outline of this Part

    * The following is a simplified outline of this Part: 

    * The Minister may make a contract with a company for the Commonwealth to make payments of 2 kinds to the company.

    * The first kind (called **_forestry service payments_**):

       * (a) are to be spent by the company on activities benefiting the Australian forestry industry and on payments of the Commonwealth's expenses relating to the collection of amounts it receives from the industry as primary industry levies and charges and related payments; and

       * (b) cannot exceed those amounts.

    * The second kind (called **_matching payments_**):

       * (a) are to be spent by the company on research and development benefiting the Australian forestry industry and the Australian community and on payments of the Commonwealth's expenses relating to the collection of amounts it receives from the industry as primary industry levies and charges and related payments; and

       * (b) are subject to limits based on those amounts, the annual value of production by the industry and the amount spent by the company on that research and development.

##### 8  Funding contract

    * (1) The Minister may, on behalf of the Commonwealth, enter into or vary a contract with a company so that the contract provides for the Commonwealth to make payments of the following kinds to the company:

     * (a) payments called **_forestry service payments_**;

     * (b) payments made for particular financial years, called **_matching payments_**.

       * Note: After a contract has been entered into, the company can be declared as the industry services body under section 11.

    * (2) Before acting to enter into or vary the contract, the Minister must be satisfied that the terms of the contract after the action will make adequate provision to ensure that:

     * (a) forestry service payments are spent by the company on one or both of the following:

      * (i) marketing, promotion, research and development activities, or other activities, for the benefit of the Australian forestry industry;

      * (ii) payments by the company to the Commonwealth to meet the expenses (the **_administration expenses_**) incurred by the Commonwealth in relation to the collection and recovery of taxrelated amounts, the administration of the contract and the payment of refunds related to taxrelated amounts; and

     * (b) matching payments are spent by the company on one or more of the following:

      * (i) research and development activities for the benefit of the Australian forestry industry and the Australian community generally;

      * (ia) payments by the company to the Commonwealth under subsection 9(4);

      * (ii) payments by the company to the Commonwealth to meet the administration expenses; and

     * (c) the administration expenses are met from one or more of the following:

      * (i) the difference between forestry service payments and the limit under section 9 on the appropriation for those payments;

      * (ii) the difference between matching payments and the limit under section 9 on the appropriation for those payments;

      * (iii) payments by the company to the Commonwealth.

       * Note: An example of the administration expenses is the Commonwealth's expenses relating to an agreement under section 10 or 11 of the _Primary Industries Levies and Charges Collection Act 1991_ between the Commonwealth and a State or organisation for it (or a State authority) to collect levies, charges and related amounts on the Commonwealth's behalf.

    * (3) The contract does not have to oblige the Commonwealth to pay the full amounts that could be paid out of the money appropriated under section 9.

       * Note: For example, the contract may provide for payments less than the limits specified in section 9 so the administration expenses are met.

    * (4) The contract may include provisions relating to assets and liabilities that will become those of the company under the _Forestry Marketing and Research and Development Services (Transitional and Consequential Provisions) Act 2007_. This subsection does not impliedly limit the matters that may be included in the contract.

    * (5) This section does not impliedly limit the executive power of the Commonwealth to enter into agreements.

    * (6) The Minister must cause a copy of the contract to be tabled in each House of the Parliament within 15 sitting days of that House after the day on which the contract was entered into.

    * (7) If the contract is varied, the Minister must cause a copy of the contract as varied to be tabled in each House of the Parliament within 15 sitting days of that House after the variation occurred.

##### 9  Appropriation for payments under funding contract etc.

    * (1) The Consolidated Revenue Fund is appropriated for the purposes of payments by the Commonwealth under section 8.

    * Overall limit for forestry service payments

    * (2) For forestry service payments, the total limit on the appropriation is the sum of the taxrelated amounts.

    * Overall limit for matching payments

    * (3) For matching payments, the total limit on the appropriation is the sum of:

     * (a) the taxrelated amounts; and

     * (b) amounts prescribed by the regulations.

    * (3A) Subsection (3) does not apply if the company is prescribed by the regulations as a company to which the subsection does not apply.

    * Matching payments--retention limit

    * (4) The matching payments made to the company during a particular financial year are subject to the condition that, if:

     * (a) before the end of 31 October next following the financial year, the Minister determines the amount of the gross value of production of the Australian forestry industry in the financial year; and

     * (b) as at the end of 31 October next following the financial year, the sum of the matching payments that were paid to the company during the financial year exceeds the lesser of:

      * (i) 0.5% of the amount of the gross value of production of the Australian forestry industry in the financial year as determined by the Minister; and

      * (ii) 50% of the amount spent by the company in the financial year on activities that qualify, under the funding contract, as research and development activities;

    * the company will pay to the Commonwealth an amount equal to the excess.

       * Note: This ensures that the sum of the matching payments that are retained by the company in relation to the financial year does not exceed the lesser of the amounts calculated under subparagraphs (b)(i) and (b)(ii).

    * (4A) If:

     * (a) before the end of 31 October next following a financial year, the Minister has not determined under subsection (4) the amount of the gross value of production of the Australian forestry industry in the financial year; and

     * (b) the Minister has determined under subsection (4) the amount of the gross value of production of the Australian forestry industry in the previous financial year;

    * the Minister is taken to have made, immediately before the end of that 31 October, a determination under subsection (4) that the amount of the gross value of production of the Australian forestry industry in the financial year is equal to the amount of the gross value of production of the Australian forestry industry determined under subsection (3) for the previous financial year.

    * (4B) An amount payable under subsection (4) by a company:

     * (a) is a debt due to the Commonwealth; and

     * (b) may be recovered by the Minister, on behalf of the Commonwealth, by action in a court of competent jurisdiction.

    * (4C) A determination made under subsection (4) is not a legislative instrument.

    * (5) For the purposes of subsection (4), the regulations may prescribe the manner in which the Minister is to determine the gross value of production of the Australian forestry industry in a financial year.

    * Matching payments--unmatched R and D excess

    * (6) If there is an unmatched R and D excess for a financial year, the amount spent by the company in the following financial year on activities that qualify, under the funding contract, as research and development activities is taken, for the purposes of this section (including for the purposes of this subsection and subsection (7)), to be increased by the amount of the unmatched R and D excess.

       * Note: This means that research and development expenditure that is not "50% matched" in one financial year because of the condition in subparagraph (4)(b)(i) can be carried forward into later years.

    * (7) For the purposes of subsection (6), there is an **_unmatched R and D excess_** for a financial year if:

     * (a) the company spends a particular amount (the **_R and D spend amount_**) in the financial year on activities that qualify, under the funding contract, as research and development activities; and

     * (b) because of subparagraph (4)(b)(i), the net matching payments for the financial year are less than 50% of the R and D spend amount.

    * The amount of the unmatched R and D excess is: 

       * Note: Amounts spent and received by the Forest and Wood Products Research and Development Corporation before it ceased to exist may also affect whether there is an unmatched R and D excess, and its amount: see the _Forestry Marketing and Research and Development Services (Transitional and Consequential Provisions) Act 2007_.

    * Set off

    * (8) If:

     * (a) an amount (the **_first amount_**) is payable by the company under subsection (4); and

     * (b) another amount (the **_second amount_**) is payable by the Commonwealth to the company under the funding contract;

    * the Minister may, on behalf of the Commonwealth, set off the whole or a part of the first amount against the whole or a part of the second amount.

    * Net matching payments

    * (9) For the purposes of this section, **_net matching payments_** for a financial year means the total of the matching payments made to the company during the financial year, less the amount payable by the company under subsection (4) as a condition of those matching payments.
