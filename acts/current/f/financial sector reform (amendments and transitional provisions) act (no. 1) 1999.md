However, acceptance of an application for an increase to, or a continuation of, an existing interest in a benefit fund does not constitute the issue of a policy.

   * _Interests in benefit funds existing as at the transfer date_

   * _	(2)	An interest that a person holds in a benefit fund of a friendly society on the date that is the transfer date for the purposes of the _Financial Sector Reform (Amendments and Transitional Provisions) Act (No. 1) 1999_ is taken to be a policy issued to the person by the friendly society.

       * Note 2: The policy that a friendly society is taken by subsection (1) or (2) to issue or to have issued will, depending on the terms of the benefit fund rules, be:

     * (a) the other provisions of this Subdivision; and

##### 230C  Direction not grounds for denial of obligations

   * (1) Subject to subsections (2) and (3), the fact that a life company is subject to a direction by APRA under section 230B is not a ground for any other party to a contract to which the company is a party to deny any obligations under that contract, accelerate any debt under that contract or close out any transaction relating to that contract.

   * (2) If a life company is prevented from fulfilling its obligations under a contract because of a direction under section 230B, other than a direction under paragraph 230B(2)(m), the other party or parties to the contract are, subject to any orders made under subsection (3), relieved from obligations owed to the company under the contract.

##### 116L  Assessable income includes taxable contributions

   * The assessable income of an RSA provider that is a registered organization includes all taxable contributions made during the year of income to RSAs provided by the RSA provider.

##### 116M  Calculation of RSA category A amount

   * (1) This section sets out how to calculate the RSA category A amount of an RSA provider's RSA combined component.

   * (2) The RSA category A amount of an RSA provider is the sum of:

     * (a) all taxable contributions made; and

     * (b) other amounts (other than contributions) credited;

   * during the year of income, to RSAs provided by the RSA provider, reduced by any amounts paid from the RSA other than benefits paid to, or in respect of, the holder of the RSA.

   * (3) In calculating the RSA category A amount, any amount of tax paid in respect of an RSA is taken not to have been an amount paid from the RSA.

   * (4) In calculating the sum, the amounts set out in subsections (5) and (6) are taken not to have been credited.

   * (5) Amounts credited to an RSA where an annuity was paid from the RSA in respect of so much of the year of income as the RSA existed.

##### 116N  Components of RSA combined component

   * (1) The RSA combined component of an RSA provider that is a registered organization is divided into the**_ RSA category A component _**and the **_RSA category B component_**.

   * (2) The RSA category A component is equal to the RSA category A amount worked out under section 116M.

   * (3) The RSA category B component is the amount (if any) remaining after deducting the RSA category A component from the RSA combined component.

##### 116O  Taxable income and amount of components in certain cases

   * (1) This section applies if:

     * (a) an RSA provider has no taxable income; or

     * (b) an RSA provider has no RSA combined component; or

     * (c) the RSA combined component of an RSA provider is less than the RSA category A amount.

   * (2) If, apart from this subsection, an RSA provider has no taxable income, or the taxable income is less than the RSA category A amount:

     * (a) the RSA provider is taken to have both a taxable income and a tax loss in relation to the year of income; and

     * (b) the taxable income is taken to equal the RSA category A amount; and

     * (c) the tax loss is taken to be the amount that would have been the RSA provider's tax loss if the RSA category A amount were not income derived; and
