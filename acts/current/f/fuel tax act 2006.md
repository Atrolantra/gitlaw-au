##### 21  Overview and purpose of the fuel tax law

    * This Act provides a single system of fuel tax credits. Fuel tax credits are paid to reduce or remove the incidence of fuel tax levied on taxable fuels, ensuring that, generally, fuel tax is effectively only applied to:

     * (a) fuel used in private vehicles and for certain other private purposes; and

     * (b) fuel used onroad in light vehicles for business purposes.

    * Liability for fuel tax currently arises under the _Excise Act 1901_, the _Excise Tariff Act 1921_, the _Customs Act 1901_ and the _Customs Tariff Act 1995_.

    * The administrative aspects of this Act (such as your rights, obligations and payment arrangements) are aligned as closely as possible to the administrative aspects of other indirect taxes (primarily, the GST), and other taxes administered by the Commissioner, to reduce your compliance costs.

##### Guide to Division 43

##### 431  What this Division is about

    * The amount of your credit for taxable fuel is the amount of fuel tax that was payable on the fuel, reduced to take account of certain grants and subsidies that were payable in respect of the fuel (as the grants or subsidies reduced the amount of fuel tax that effectively applied to the fuel).

    * For taxable fuel that is a blend of fuels, there are additional rules for working out the amount of your credit.

    * In some cases, the credit is reduced so that some of the fuel tax can be retained to fund cleaner fuel grants and as a road user charge.

##### 435  Working out your fuel tax credit

    * (1) The *amount of your tax fuel credit for taxable fuel is the amount of *effective fuel tax that is payable on the fuel.

         * Note: The amount of the credit may be reduced under section 4310.

    * Amount of effective fuel tax

    * (2) The *amount of **_effective fuel tax_** that is payable on the fuel is the amount (but not less than nil) worked out using the formula:

    * where: 

    * **_fuel tax amount _**means the *amount of fuel tax that was or would be payable on the fuel at the rate in force on the day worked out using the table in subsection (2A).

    * **_grant or subsidy amount _**means the *amount of any grant or subsidy, except a grant specified in subsection (3), that was or would be payable in respect of the fuel by the Commonwealth at the rate in force on the day worked out using the table in subsection (2A).

         * Note: Section 437 affects how this subsection applies to blends.

    * Day for rate of fuel tax, grant or subsidy

    * (2A) Work out the day using the table:

         * Note: Division 65 sets out which tax period a credit is attributable to.

    * Exclusions from grant or subsidy amount

    * (3) In applying subsection (2), the following grants are disregarded:

     * (a) a grant under the Biofuels Capital Grants Program;

     * (c) a grant for petrol or diesel under the _Energy Grants (Cleaner Fuels) Scheme Act 2004_;

     * (d) a benefit under the _Product Stewardship (Oil) Act 2000_.

##### 436  Meaning of fuel tax

    * (1) **_Fuel tax_** is duty that is payable on fuel under:

     * (a) the _Excise Act 1901_ and the _Excise Tariff Act 1921_; or

     * (b) the _Customs Act 1901_ and the _Customs Tariff Act 1995_;

    * other than any duty that is expressed as a percentage of the value of fuel for the purposes of section 9 of the _Customs Tariff Act 1995_.

    * (2) For the purposes of subsection (1), if:

     * (a) an Excise Tariff alteration, proposed by a motion moved in the House of Representatives, relates to duty payable on fuel; or

     * (b) a Customs Tariff alteration, proposed by a motion moved in the House of Representatives, relates to duty payable on fuel;

    * the alteration is taken to have effect as if it is an amendment of the Act it proposes to alter, and as if that amendment is in force.

    * (3) However, the alteration ceases to be taken to have that effect unless, before whichever of the following first happens:

     * (a) the close of the session in which the Excise Tariff alteration or Customs Tariff alteration, is proposed;

     * (b) the expiration of 12 months after the Excise Tariff alteration or Customs Tariff alteration, is proposed;

    * (4) For the purposes of subsection (3), the Excise Tariff alteration, or the Customs Tariff alteration, is taken to have been proposed at the time the motion referred to in subsection (2) was moved.

##### 437  Working out the effective fuel tax for fuel blends

    * Certain blends containing ethanol

    * (1) The **_effective fuel tax_** for taxable fuel that:

     * (a) is a blend of ethanol and one or more other kinds of fuel; and

     * (b) meets the requirements prescribed by the regulations;

    * is worked out under subsection 435(2) as if the fuel were entirely petrol.

    * Certain blends containing biodiesel

    *  (2) The **_effective fuel tax_** for taxable fuel that:

     * (a) is a blend of *biodiesel and one or more other kinds of fuel; and

     * (b) meets the requirements prescribed by the regulations;

    * is worked out under subsection 435(2) as if the fuel were entirely diesel.

    * Other blends for which there is evidence of fuel proportions

    * (3) The **_effective fuel tax_** for taxable fuel:

     * (a) that is a blend of more than one kind of fuel; and

     * (b) to which neither subsection (1) nor (2) applies; and

     * (c) for which you have documentary evidence that satisfies the Commissioner of the actual proportions of the kinds of fuel in the blend;

    * is worked out under subsection 435(2) in accordance with those proportions.

    * (4) The Commissioner may determine, by legislative instrument, the kinds of documentary evidence that are able to satisfy the Commissioner for the purposes of paragraph (3)(c).

    * (5) If:

     * (a) you acquire or manufacture in, or import into, the indirect tax zone a taxable fuel that is a blend of either of the following (whether or not the blend includes other substances other than fuel):

       * (i) petrol and one other kind of fuel;

       * (ii) diesel and one other kind of fuel; and

     * (b) none of subsections (1), (2) or (3) apply to the fuel; and

     * (c) you acquire, manufacture or import the fuel on terms and conditions that specify or require that the blend contains a minimum percentage by volume of petrol or diesel (as the case requires);

    * then the **_effective fuel tax_** for the fuel is worked out under subsection 435(2) as if:

     * (d) the fuel contains that minimum percentage of petrol or diesel (as the case requires); and

     * (e) the remaining percentage by volume of the fuel consists of the other kind of fuel contained in the blend.

    * Rules for working out fuel tax in other cases of blends

    * (6) For the purposes of working out under subsection 435(2) the *effective fuel tax payable on taxable fuels that are blends other than blends to which any of subsections (1), (2), (3) or (5) of this section apply, the Commissioner may determine, by legislative instrument, rules for working out the proportions of one or more of the constituents of the blends.

         * Note: The rules may make different provision for different blends or different classes of blends (see subsection 33(3A) of the _Acts Interpretation Act 1901_).

    * Working out the fuel tax for certain fuels containing ethanol

    * (7) Work out the *effective fuel tax under subsection 435(2) for taxable fuel:

     * (a) that you acquired, manufactured or imported; and

     * (b) that is a blend containing ethanol; and

     * (c) to which neither subsection (1) nor (2) of this section applies;

    * as if a grant under a funding agreement with the Commonwealth connected with a program called the Ethanol Production Grants Program was payable for all the ethanol.

         * Note: As you may not know whether the ethanol contained in the blend is imported or produced domestically, subsection (7) requires you to work out the effective fuel tax assuming that the ethanol was produced domestically and had attracted the payment of a grant.

##### 4310  Reducing the amount of your fuel tax credit

    * Cleaner fuel grants

    * (1) The *amount of your fuel tax credit for taxable fuel is reduced to the extent, determined by the Minister, that fuel tax is imposed on the fuel to fund a cleaner fuel grant.

    * (2) For the purposes of subsection (1), the Minister must determine, by legislative instrument, the *amount of the fuel tax imposed that will fund a cleaner fuel grant.

    * Road user charge

    * (3) To the extent that you acquire, manufacture or import taxable fuel to use, in a vehicle, for travelling on a public road, the *amount of your fuel tax credit for the fuel is reduced by the amount of the road user charge for the fuel.

         * Note: Only certain motor vehicles whose gross vehicle mass is more than 4.5 tonnes are entitled to any credit (see sections 4120 and 4125).

    * (4) However, the *amount is not reduced under subsection (3) if the vehicle's travel on a public road is incidental to the vehicle's main use.

    * Working out the amount of the reduction

    * (6) The *amount by which a fuel tax credit for taxable fuel is reduced under subsection (1) or (3) is worked out by reference to the rate of fuel tax or road user charge in force on the day worked out using the table in subsection 435(2A).

    * Determining the rate of road user charge

    * (7) The *amount of road user charge for taxable fuel is worked out using the following rate:

     * (a) if no rate has been determined by the *Transport Minister--21 cents for each litre of the fuel;

     * (b) otherwise--the rate determined by the Transport Minister.

    * (8) For the purposes of subsection (7), the *Transport Minister may determine, by legislative instrument, the rate of the road user charge.

    * (9) Before the *Transport Minister determines an increased rate of road user charge, the Transport Minister must:

     * (a) make the following publicly available for at least 60 days:

       * (i) the proposed increased rate of road user charge;

       * (ii) any information that was relied on in determining the proposed increased rate; and

     * (b) consider any comments received, within the period specified by the Transport Minister, from the public in relation to the proposed increased rate.

    * (10) However, the *Transport Minister may, as a result of considering any comments received from the public in accordance with subsection (9), determine a rate of road user charge that is different from the proposed rate that was made publicly available without making that different rate publicly available in accordance with that subsection.

    * (11) In determining the road user charge, the *Transport Minister must not apply a method for indexing the charge.

    * (12) The *Transport Minister must not make more than one determination in a financial year if the effect of the determination would be to increase the road user charge more than once in that financial year.

     * 44A	Increasing and decreasing fuel tax adjustments

##### Guide to Division 44

##### 441  What this Division is about

    * Your entitlement to a fuel tax credit for taxable fuel is worked out on the basis of what the fuel is intended for when you acquire, manufacture or import the fuel.

    * If you use or supply the fuel differently, or you do not use or supply the fuel at all, you have an increasing or decreasing fuel tax adjustment.

    * Fuel tax adjustments are included in working out your net fuel amount under Division 60. (Your assessed net fuel amount determines how much you owe the Commissioner or the Commissioner owes you.)

##### Subdivision 44A--Increasing and decreasing fuel tax adjustments

##### Table of Sections

      * 445	Increasing and decreasing fuel tax adjustments for change of circumstances

      * 4410	Increasing fuel tax adjustment for failure to use or make a taxable supply of fuel

##### 445  Increasing and decreasing fuel tax adjustments for change of circumstances

    * (1) You have a *fuel tax adjustment if you use fuel, or make a *taxable supply of fuel, and the *amount of the fuel tax credit to which you would have been entitled for the use or supply would have been different from the amount to which you are or were entitled if one or both of the following were to apply:

     * (a) you had originally acquired, manufactured or imported the fuel to use or make a taxable supply in the circumstances in which you did use, or make a taxable supply of, the fuel;

     * (b) an alteration of a kind referred to in subsection 436(2) that:

       * (i) under that subsection, had been taken to have effect as if it is an amendment of an Act; and

       * (ii) under subsection 436(3) ceased to be taken to have that effect;

     * had never been proposed as mentioned in subsection 436(2).

    * (2) The *amount of the adjustment is the difference between the 2 amounts.

         * Note: Division 65 sets out which tax period or fuel tax return period the fuel tax adjustment is attributable to.

    * Decreasing fuel tax adjustments

    * (3) The *fuel tax adjustment is a **_decreasing fuel tax adjustment_** if the *amount to which you would have been entitled is greater than the amount to which you are or were entitled.

    * Increasing fuel tax adjustments

    * (4) The *fuel tax adjustment is an **_increasing fuel tax adjustment _**if the *amount to which you are or were entitled is greater than the amount to which you would have been entitled.

         * Example: You acquire taxable fuel to use in a harvester in carrying on your farming enterprise, so you are paid a fuel tax credit for the fuel. Later on, you use the fuel to transport wheat in a vehicle of more than 4.5 tonnes travelling on a public road. As your fuel tax credit would have been reduced by the amount of the road user charge, you have an increasing fuel tax adjustment of the difference between the 2 amounts.

##### 4410  Increasing fuel tax adjustment for failure to use or make a taxable supply of fuel

    * You have an**_ increasing fuel tax adjustment_** if:

     * (a) you are or were entitled to a fuel tax credit for taxable fuel; and

     * (b) you have no reasonable prospect of using, or making a *taxable supply of, the fuel.

    * The *amount of the adjustment is the amount of the credit that you are or were entitled to.

         * Example: You acquire taxable fuel to use in a harvester in carrying on your farming enterprise, so you are paid a fuel tax credit for the fuel. Later on, the fuel is stolen. You have an increasing fuel tax adjustment of the amount of the credit.

         * Note: Division 65 sets out which tax period or fuel tax return period the fuel tax adjustment is attributable to.

##### Guide to Division 46

##### 461  What this Division is about

    * If you are a GST instalment taxpayer, you work out and claim your fuel tax credits for GST instalment quarters, instead of the annual tax period you use for the GST. However, you can choose not to give a return for the first 3 GST instalment quarters in a financial year (but if you have an increasing fuel tax adjustment, you must give a return for the last quarter in the year).

##### Subdivision 46A--Instalment taxpayers

##### Table of Sections

      * 465	Instalment taxpayers

##### 465  Instalment taxpayers

    * (1) If you are a *GST instalment payer, you must treat each *GST instalment quarter as if it were a *tax period.

    * GST instalment quarters to be treated as tax periods

    * (2) For the purposes of working out under subsection 655(1) which *GST instalment quarter a fuel tax credit is attributable to, you must treat each GST instalment quarter as if, in the *GST Act, the quarter were a *tax period.

    * Choice to give a return for first 3 quarters

    * (3) You may choose whether to give the Commissioner a return for any of the first 3 *GST instalment quarters in a *financial year. If you do so, you must give the Commissioner your return on or before the day on which you are, or would be, required to pay your *GST instalment to the Commissioner for the quarter (disregarding section 16280 of the *GST Act).

         * Note: Section 16280 of the GST Act allows certain entities to pay only 2 GST instalments for a financial year.

    * (4) If you choose not to give a return for any of those quarters, then any fuel tax credit or *fuel tax adjustment that is attributable to that quarter:

     * (a) ceases to be attributable to that quarter; and

     * (b) becomes attributable to the first quarter for which you give the Commissioner a return.

         * Note: See subsection 655(4) if your return for a quarter does not include a fuel tax credit that is attributable, under this subsection, to the quarter.

    * Requirement to give a return for final quarter

    * (5) If you have an *increasing fuel tax adjustment that is (or, under subsection (4), would be) attributable to the last *GST instalment quarter in the *financial year, you must give the Commissioner a return for that quarter on or before the day on which you are, or would be, required to pay your *GST instalment to the Commissioner for the quarter (disregarding section 16280 of the *GST Act).

     * exceeded the amount (including a nil amount) that would have been payable or applicable had your assessed net fuel amount always been the later assessed net fuel amount;

    * you must pay the excess to the Commissioner as if: 

     * (d) the excess were an assessed net fuel amount for that period; and

     * (e) that assessed net fuel amount were an amount greater than zero and equal to the amount of the excess; and

     * (f) despite section 6110, that assessed net fuel amount became payable, and due for payment, by you at the time when the amount was paid or applied.

         * Note: Treating the excess as if it were an assessed net fuel amount has the effect of applying the collection and recovery rules in Part 310 in Schedule 1 to the _Taxation Administration Act 1953_, such as a liability to pay the general interest charge under section 10580 in that Schedule.

##### 617  When entitlement arises

    * Your entitlement to be paid an *amount under section 615 arises when the Commissioner gives you notice of the *assessment of your *net fuel amount for the *tax period or *fuel tax return period.

         * Note: In certain circumstances, the Commissioner is treated as having given you notice of the assessment when you give to the Commissioner your return (see section 15515 in Schedule 1 to the _Taxation Administration Act 1953_).

##### 6110  Requirement to pay an assessed net fuel amount

    * You must pay your *assessed net fuel amount for a *tax period to the Commissioner by the day on which you are required under section 465 or 6115 to give to the Commissioner your return for the tax period, if your assessed net fuel amount is greater than zero.

##### 6115  When you must give the Commissioner your return

    * (1) If you are *registered for GST, or *required to be registered for GST, you must give the Commissioner your return for a *tax period on or before the day on which you are required to give the Commissioner your *GST return for the tax period.

         * Note 1: For the penalties for failing to comply with these obligations, see the _Taxation Administration Act 1953_.

         * Note 2: If you lodge your GST return electronically, you must also electronically notify the Commissioner of your net fuel amount (see section 38880 in Schedule 1 to the _Taxation Administration Act 1953_).

         * Note 3: Instalment taxpayers may give their returns on a different day (see section 465).

    * (2) If you are neither *registered for GST, nor *required to be registered for GST, you must give the Commissioner your return for a *fuel tax return period by the 21st day after the end of the fuel tax return period.

    * (2A) You must, if required by the Commissioner, whether before or after the end of a *tax period or *fuel tax return period, give to the Commissioner, within the time required, a return or a further or fuller return for the tax period or fuel tax return period or a specified period, whether or not you have given the Commissioner a return for the tax period or fuel tax return period under subsection (1) or (2).

    * (3) You must give the Commissioner your return for a *tax period or a *fuel tax return period in the *approved form.

##### 6117  Returns treated as being duly made

    * A return purporting to be made or signed by or on behalf of an entity is treated as having been duly made by the entity or with the entity's authority until the contrary is proved.

##### 6120  Fuel tax return periods

    * (1) If you are neither *registered for GST, nor *required to be registered for GST, your **_fuel tax return period _**is the period specified in the return.

    * (2) However, you must end a *fuel tax return period within 90 days, or any longer period allowed by the Commissioner, after you become aware of an *increasing fuel tax adjustment under Division 44. If you do not do so, your **_fuel tax return period _**ends at the end of the 90 days, or the longer period allowed by the Commissioner.

         * Note: You must give your return to the Commissioner by the 21st day after the end of the fuel tax return period (see section 6115).

     * 65A	Attribution rules

##### Guide to Division 65

##### 651  What this Division is about

    * Fuel tax credits and fuel tax adjustments are attributed to tax periods (or fuel tax return periods).

    * Generally, if you are a business taxpayer, your fuel tax credit for taxable fuel is attributed to the same period as your input tax credit for the fuel (to reduce compliance costs). If you are a nonbusiness taxpayer, your fuel tax credit for taxable fuel is attributed to the fuel tax return period in which you acquire, manufacture or import the fuel.

    * Fuel tax adjustments are attributed to the tax period (or fuel tax return period) in which you become aware of the adjustment.

##### Subdivision 65A--Attribution rules

##### Table of Sections

##### 655  Attribution rules for fuel tax credits

    * Attribution rules for fuel you acquire or import

    * (1) If you are *registered for GST, or *required to be registered for GST, your fuel tax credit for taxable fuel that you acquire or import is attributable to:

     * (a) the same *tax period that your *input tax credit for the fuel is attributable to under the *GST Act; or

     * (b) the same tax period that an input tax credit would have been attributable to under that Act if the fuel had been a *creditable acquisition or a *creditable importation.

    * (2) If you are neither *registered for GST, nor *required to be registered for GST, your fuel tax credit for taxable fuel that you acquire or import is attributable to the *fuel tax return period in which you acquire or import the fuel.

    * Attribution rule for fuel you manufacture

    * (3) Your fuel tax credit for taxable fuel that you manufacture is attributable to the *tax period or *fuel tax return period in which the fuel was entered for home consumption (within the meaning of the _Excise Act 1901_).

    * Later attribution rule for fuel tax credits

    * (4) If your return for a *tax period or *fuel tax return period does not take into account a fuel tax credit that is attributable to the period mentioned in subsection (1), (2) or (3), then the credit:

     * (a) ceases to be attributable to that period; and

     * (b) becomes attributable to the first period for which you give the Commissioner a return that does take it into account.

         * Note: For another attribution rule for fuel tax credits, see subsection 465(4) (GST instalment taxpayers).

##### 6510  Attribution rules for fuel tax adjustments

    * A *fuel tax adjustment under Division 44 is attributable to the *tax period or *fuel tax return period in which you become aware of the adjustment.

         * Note: For another attribution rule for fuel tax adjustments, see subsection 465(4) (GST instalment taxpayers).

##### 7010  Entry and exit history rules

    * Entry history rule

    * (1) For the purposes of the *fuel tax law, from the time when a particular entity starts to be treated as part of a single entity under section 705, everything that happened (including because of any previous application of this section) before that time, in relation to any fuel in the hands of the particular entity at that time, is taken to have happened as if the fuel had been in the hands of the single entity.

         * Example: The single entity is taken to have acquired the fuel for the purposes for which the particular entity acquired the fuel.

    * Exit history rule

    * (2) For the purposes of the *fuel tax law, from the time when a particular entity ceases to be treated as part of a single entity under section 705, everything that happened (including because of any previous application of this section) before that time, in relation to any fuel in the hands of the particular entity immediately after that time, is taken to have happened as if the fuel had been in the hands of the particular entity.

         * Example: The particular entity is taken to have acquired the fuel for the purposes for which the single entity acquired the fuel.

##### 7015  Consolidating joint venture returns

    * If, under section 5152 of the *GST Act, an election is in force to consolidate a *joint venture operator's *GST returns relating to its *GST joint ventures, the operator must consolidate its returns under this Act relating to the joint ventures.

##### 7020  Application of fuel tax law to religious practitioners

    * The *fuel tax law applies to *religious practitioners and religious institutions in the same way as the *GST Act applies to them under Division 50 of that Act.

    * The *fuel tax law applies to an *incapacitated entity and its representative (within the meaning of the *GST Act) in the same way as that Act applies to them under Division 58 of that Act.

##### 7030  Application of fuel tax law to GST branches, resident agents and nonprofit subentities

    * While an entity meets the condition in column 1 of the table, the *fuel tax law applies to:

     * (a) the entity; and

     * (b) its fuel tax credits, *net fuel amount, *assessed net fuel amount and *fuel tax adjustments;

    * in a corresponding way to the way in which the *GST law applies, because of the Division of the *GST Act mentioned in column 2, to:

##### 751  What this Division is about

    * The object of this Division is to deter schemes that give entities benefits by reducing fuel tax, increasing refunds or altering the timing of payment of assessed net fuel amounts.

    * If the dominant purpose or principal effect of a scheme is to give an entity such a benefit, the Commissioner may negate the benefit any entity gets from the scheme by making a declaration stating the entity's net fuel amount for a particular tax period, despite the scheme.

       * (i) an entity that (whether alone or with others) entered into or carried out the scheme, or part of the scheme, did so with the sole or dominant purpose of that entity or another entity getting a fuel tax benefit from the scheme; or

       * (ii) the principal effect of the scheme, or of part of the scheme, is that the avoider gets the fuel tax benefit from the scheme directly or indirectly; and

     * (d) the avoider gets the fuel tax benefit from the scheme on or after 1 July 2006.

    * Territorial application

    * (2) It does not matter whether the *scheme, or any part of the scheme, was entered into or carried out inside or outside Australia.

    * (2) An entity can get a *fuel tax benefit from a *scheme even if the entity or entities that entered into or carried out the scheme, or a part of the scheme, could not have engaged economically in any activities:

     * (a) of the kind to which this Act applies; and

     * (b) that would produce an effect equivalent (except in terms of this Act) to the effect of the scheme or part of the scheme;

    * other than the activities involved in entering into or carrying out the scheme or part of the scheme.

##### 7515  Matters to be considered in determining purpose or effect

    * (1) The following matters are to be taken into account under section 755 in considering an entity's purpose in entering into or carrying out the *scheme from which the avoider got a *fuel tax benefit, and the effect of the scheme:

     * (h) any change that has resulted, or may reasonably be expected to result, from the scheme in the financial position of an entity (a **_connected entity_**) that has or had a connection or dealing with the avoider, whether the connection or dealing is or was of a family, business or other nature;

     * (i) any other consequence for the avoider or a connected entity of the scheme having been entered into or carried out;

     * (j) the nature of the connection between the avoider and a connected entity;

     * (k) the circumstances surrounding the scheme;

     * (l) any other relevant circumstances.

    * (2) Subsection (1) applies in relation to consideration of an entity's purpose in entering into or carrying out a part of a *scheme from which the avoider gets a *fuel tax benefit, and the effect of part of the scheme, as if the part were itself the scheme from which the avoider gets the fuel tax benefit.
