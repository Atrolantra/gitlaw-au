      * (b) an *input tax credit or *fuel tax credit that is attributable to a particular tax period; or

     * Fuel tax--nonbusiness taxpayers

     * (3) If you are neither *registered for GST nor *required to be registered for GST, you are not entitled to a refund or *fuel tax credit to which this subsection applies in respect of a *fuel tax return period, acquisition, manufacture or importation unless:

      * (a) within 4 years after:

        * (i) the end of the fuel tax return period; or

        * (ii) the acquisition, manufacture or importation;

      * (as the case requires) you notify the Commissioner that you are entitled to the refund or credit; or

      * (c) in the case of a fuel tax credit--the credit is taken into account in working out a *net fuel amount that the Commissioner may recover from you only because of paragraph 10550(b).

##### 10560  Reliance on Commissioner's interpretation of an indirect tax law (other than a fuel tax law)

     * (1) This section applies to you if:

      * (a) the Commissioner alters a previous *indirect tax ruling that applied to you; and

      * (b) relying on the previous ruling, you have underpaid a *net amount or an amount of *indirect tax, or the Commissioner has overpaid an amount under section 355 of the *GST Act, in respect of one or more:

        * (i) *taxable supplies or *taxable importations; or

        * (ii) *wine taxable dealings; or

        * (iii) *taxable supplies of luxury cars or *taxable importations of luxury cars; or

        * (iv) *creditable acquisitions or *creditable importations;

      * that happened before the alteration.

         * Note: For reliance on the Commissioner's interpretation of a fuel tax law, see Division 357.

     * (2) Unless the Commissioner is satisfied that you contributed to the giving, or continuing in force, of the earlier ruling by a misstatement or by suppressing a material fact:

      * (a) the underpaid *net amount or *indirect tax ceases to be payable; or

      * (b) the overpaid amount under section 355 of the *GST Act is taken to have been payable in full;

     * from when the previous ruling was made.

     * (3) In deciding whether an *indirect tax ruling applies to you, or whether a ruling has been altered:

      * (a) a *private indirect tax ruling applies only to the entity to whom it was given; and

      * (b) so far as a private indirect tax ruling conflicts with an earlier *public indirect tax ruling, the private indirect tax ruling prevails; and

      * (c) so far as a public indirect tax ruling conflicts with an earlier private indirect tax ruling, the public indirect tax ruling prevails; and

      * (d) an alteration that a later indirect tax ruling makes to an earlier indirect tax ruling is disregarded so far as the alteration results from a change in the law that came into operation after the earlier indirect tax ruling was given.

##### 10565  Restriction on refunds

     * (1) The Commissioner need not give you a refund to which this section applies, or apply an amount under Division 3 or 3A of Part IIB to which this section applies, if:

      * (a) you overpaid the amount, or the amount was not refunded to you, because a *supply was treated as a *taxable supply to any extent; and

      * (b) the supply is not a taxable supply to that extent (for example, because it is *GSTfree); and

      * (c) one of the following applies:

        * (i) the Commissioner is not satisfied that you have reimbursed a corresponding amount to the recipient of the supply;

        * (ii) the recipient is *registered or *required to be registered.

         * Note: Divisions 3 and 3A of Part IIB deal with payments, credits and RBA surpluses.

     * (2) This section applies to:

      * (a) so much of any *net amount or amount of *indirect tax as you have overpaid; or

      * (b) so much of any net amount that is payable to you under section 355 of the *GST Act as the Commissioner has not paid to you or applied under Division 3 of Part IIB of this Act.

         * Note: Division 3 of Part IIB deals with payments, credits and RBA surpluses.

##### 10585  Amending Acts cannot impose penalties or general interest charge earlier than 28 days after Royal Assent

      * (a) a penalty for an offence against an indirect tax law; or

      * (b) *general interest charge under section 10580;

     * for any act or omission that happens before the 28th day (the **_postponed day_**) after the day on which the amending Act receives the Royal Assent.

     * (2) If the amending Act would (apart from this section) have the effect of making you liable to such a penalty or charge because you contravened a requirement to do something:

      * (a) within a specified period ending before the postponed day; or

      * (b) before a specified time happening before the postponed day;

     * the requirement has effect instead by reference to a period ending at the start of the postponed day, or by reference to the start of the postponed day, as the case requires.

     * (3) This section does not relieve you from liability to such a penalty or charge to the extent to which the liability would have existed if the amending Act had not been enacted.
