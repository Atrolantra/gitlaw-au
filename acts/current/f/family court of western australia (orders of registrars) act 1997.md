### An Act relating to certain ineffective orders of Registrars of the Family Court of Western Australia

  * **1  Short title **[_see_ Note 1]

  * This Act may be cited as the _Family Court of Western Australia (Orders of Registrars) Act 1997_.

  * **2  Commencement **[_see_ Note 1]

  * This Act commences on the day on which it receives the Royal Assent.

##### 3  Interpretation

  * In this Act: 

  * **_corresponding Western Australian Act_** means the _Family Court (Orders of Registrars) Act 1997_ of Western Australia.

  * **_federal family jurisdiction_** means jurisdiction under:

   * (a) the _Family Law Act 1975_; or

   * (b) the _Child Support (Registration and Collection) Act 1988_; or

   * (c) the _Child Support (Assessment) Act 1989_.

  * **_ineffective order_** has the meaning given by section 4.

  * **_liability_** includes a duty or obligation.

  * **_parenting plan_** means a parenting plan under the _Family Law Act 1975_.

  * **_proceedings_** includes an initiating application.

  * **_proceedings for the order_** means:

   * (a) in relation to an ineffective order of the kind referred to in subsection 4(2)--the proceedings in or in relation to which the order was purportedly made; and

   * (b) in relation to provisions of a parenting plan that are an ineffective order of the kind referred to in subsection 4(3)--the proceedings that would have been constituted by the application to register the parenting plan if it had instead been an application to the Family Court of Western Australia for an order of the relevant kind under the _Family Law Act 1975_ and the parties to the plan had been parties to that application.

  * **_Registrar_** has the meaning it had in the _Family Court Act 1975_ of Western Australia as in force immediately before the commencement of the corresponding Western Australian Act.

  * **_registration decision_**, in relation to an ineffective order of the kind referred to in subsection 4(3), means the Registrar's decision to register the parenting plan as mentioned in that subsection.

  * **_right_** includes an interest or status.

##### 4  Meaning of ineffective order

  * (1) A reference in this Act to an **_ineffective order_** is a reference to a purported order described in subsection (2), or provisions of a parenting plan described in subsection (3). This has effect subject to subsections (4) and (5) as they affect the meaning of a reference to an ineffective order in the context of a particular case.

  * (2) An order that a Registrar has purported to make, before the commencement of the corresponding Western Australian Act, is an **_ineffective order_** if it was made:

   * (a) in the exercise or purported exercise of the federal family jurisdiction of the Family Court of Western Australia; and

   * (b) by way of a judicial determination that was not reviewable (otherwise than on appeal).

  * (3) Provisions of a parenting plan that a Registrar has purported to register under section 63E of the _Family Law Act 1975_, before the commencement of the corresponding Western Australian Act, are an **_ineffective order_** if they would have had effect under section 63F or 63G of the _Family Law Act 1975_ as a particular kind of order if the decision to register the plan had been a decision made by the Family Court of Western Australia.

  * (4) If a court or Registrar has purported to vary, revoke, set aside, revive or suspend an ineffective order, the reference is, subject to subsection (5), a reference to the order in the form in which, and to the extent to which, it purports or purported to have effect from time to time.

    * Note 1: In the case of an ineffective order of the kind referred to in subsection 4(3), this subsection applies to a purported variation, revocation, setting aside, revival or suspension of provisions of the parenting plan as they had effect as an order (rather than a purported variation, revocation, setting aside, revival or suspension of the provisions as provisions of an agreement).

    * Note 2: This subsection applies if a court has proceeded on the basis that an ineffective order was valid. The situation where a court has proceeded on the basis that an ineffective order was or might have been invalid is dealt with in section 8.

  * (5) If clause 2 of Schedule 2 to the _Family Law Reform Act 1995 _would have applied to an ineffective order if it had been an order made by the Family Court of Western Australia in the exercise of its federal family jurisdiction, then, so far as the reference relates to a time after the commencement of that Schedule, it is, subject to subsection (4), a reference to the order as it would have, or would have had, effect if that clause applied to it.

##### 5  Rights and liabilities declared in certain cases

  * (1) The rights and liabilities of all persons are, by force of this Act, declared to be, and always to have been, the same as if each ineffective order had been an order made by the Family Court of Western Australia in the exercise of its federal family jurisdiction in or in relation to the proceedings for the order.

  * (2) Subsection (1) has effect in relation to an ineffective order of the kind referred to in subsection 4(3) subject to the same conditions and limitations as apply under the _Family Law Act 1975_ in relation to provisions of registered parenting plans having effect as orders.

    * Note: See, for example, the conditions and limitations specified in sections 63F and 63G of the _Family Law Act 1975_.

##### 6  Effect of declared rights and liabilities

  * (1) A right or liability conferred, imposed or affected by section 5:

   * (a) is exercisable or enforceable; and

   * (b) is to be regarded as always having been exercisable or enforceable;

  * as if it were a right or liability conferred, imposed or affected by an order made by the Family Court of Western Australia, in the exercise of its federal family jurisdiction, in or in relation to the proceedings for the order.

  * (2) Subsection (1) has effect in relation to an ineffective order of the kind referred to in subsection 4(3) subject to the same conditions and limitations as apply under the _Family Law Act 1975_ in relation to provisions of registered parenting plans having effect as orders.

    * Note: See, for example, the conditions and limitations specified in sections 63F and 63G of the _Family Law Act 1975_.

  * (3) In this section:

  * **_enforceable_** includes able to be dealt with by proceedings under Division 2 of Part XIIIA of the _Family Law Act 1975_ relating to a contravention of an order.

##### 7  Effect of things done or omitted to be done under or in relation to rights and liabilities

  * (1) Any act or thing done or omitted to be done before or after the commencement of this Act under or in relation to a right or liability conferred, imposed or affected by section 5 of this Act, or the equivalent provision of the corresponding Western Australian Act:

   * (a) has the same effect, and gives rise to the same consequences, for the purposes of any written or other law; and

   * (b) is to be regarded as always having had the same effect, and given rise to the same consequences, for the purposes of any written or other law;

  * as if it were done or omitted to be done to give effect to, or under the authority of, or in reliance on:

   * (c) an order made by the Family Court of Western Australia, in the exercise of its federal family jurisdiction, in or in relation to the proceedings for the order; or

   * (d) an order made by the Family Court of Western Australia in or in relation to the proceedings referred to in the equivalent provision of the corresponding Western Australian Act;

  * as the case requires.

  * (2) Subject to subsection (3), for the purposes of an enforcement law (see subsection (4)), any act or thing done or omitted to be done before or after the commencement of this Act gives rise to the same consequences, and is to be regarded as always having given rise to the same consequences, as if each ineffective order were an order made by the Family Court of Western Australia, in the exercise of its federal family jurisdiction, in or in relation to the proceedings for the order.

  * (3) If, before the commencement of this Act, a court purported to convict a person of an offence against an enforcement law on the basis that an order of the kind referred to in subsection 4(2) was a valid order, nothing in this section is to be taken to validate or confirm that conviction.

  * (4) In this section:

  * **_enforcement law _**means a provision of a law of the Commonwealth, other than a law relating to contempt of court, that sets out a consequence for a person if the person:

   * (a) contravenes; or

   * (b) acts in a specified way while there is in force;

  * an order, or a particular kind of order, made by a court exercising federal family jurisdiction (whether or not the provision also applies to other orders of courts).

##### 8  Section 5 regarded as having ceased to have effect in certain cases

  * (1) If:

   * (a) before the commencement of this Act, a court, in the exercise of its federal family jurisdiction, made an order (the **_new order_**) on the basis that an ineffective order of the kind referred to in subsection 4(2) was or might be invalid; and

   * (b) the new order replaced the ineffective order (see subsection (2));

  * section 5 is to be regarded as having ceased to have effect in respect of the ineffective order when the new order took effect.

  * (2) For the purposes of subsection (1), the new order replaced the ineffective order if the new order:

   * (a) conferred or imposed rights or liabilities similar to or different from those purportedly conferred or imposed by the ineffective order; or

   * (b) affected rights or liabilities in the same way as they were purportedly affected by the ineffective order or in a different way.

  * (3) If:

   * (a) before the commencement of this Act, a court, in the exercise of its federal family jurisdiction, made an order or decision (the **_new order or decision_**) on the basis that the registration decision in relation to an ineffective order of the kind referred to in subsection 4(3) was or might be invalid; and

   * (b) the new order or decision replaced the ineffective order (see subsection (4));

  * section 5 is to be regarded as having ceased to have effect in respect of the ineffective order when the new order or decision took effect.

  * (4) For the purposes of subsection (3), the new order or decision replaced the ineffective order if:

   * (a) it was an order:

    * (i) conferring or imposing rights or liabilities similar to or different from those purportedly conferred or imposed by the ineffective order; or

    * (ii) affecting rights or liabilities in the same way as they were purportedly affected by the ineffective order or in a different way; or

   * (b) it was a decision to register the same or a different parenting plan under section 63E of the _Family Law Act 1975_.

##### 9  Powers of courts in relation to declared rights and liabilities

  * (1) A court may vary, revoke, set aside, revive or suspend a right or liability conferred, imposed or affected by section 5 as if it were a right or liability conferred, imposed or affected by an order made by the Family Court of Western Australia in the exercise of its federal family jurisdiction in or in relation to the proceedings for the order.

  * (2) In addition to its powers under subsection (1), a court also has power to make an order achieving any other result that could have been achieved if:

   * (a) the ineffective order had been an order made by the Family Court of Western Australia in the exercise of its federal family jurisdiction in or in relation to the proceedings for the order; and

   * (b) the court had been considering whether to vary, revoke, set aside, revive or suspend that order.

  * (3) This section has effect in relation to an ineffective order of the kind referred to in subsection 4(3) subject to the same conditions and limitations as apply under the _Family Law Act 1975_ in relation to provisions of registered parenting plans having effect as orders.

    * Note: See, for example, the conditions and limitations specified in sections 63F and 63G of the _Family Law Act 1975_.

##### 10  Evidence

  * The court record, or a copy of the court record, of:

   * (a) an ineffective order of the kind referred to in subsection 4(2); or

   * (b) the registration decision in relation to an ineffective order of the kind referred to in subsection 4(3);

  * may be adduced in evidence to show the existence, nature and extent of each right or liability conferred, imposed or affected by section 5.

##### 11  Act does not apply to certain orders

  * Nothing in this Act applies to an order declared to be invalid by the Full Court of the Family Court before the commencement of the corresponding Western Australian Act.

##### 12  Jurisdiction of courts

  * (1) Subject to subsection (3), jurisdiction is conferred on the Family Court and the Supreme Court of the Northern Territory, and the Family Court of Western Australia is invested with federal jurisdiction, with respect to matters arising under this Act.
