##### 2A  Objects

    * The objects of this Act are to provide for: 

     * (a) the notional application of fringe benefits tax in relation to benefits provided in respect of the employment of Commonwealth employees; and

     * (b) the calculation of the reportable fringe benefits totals of those employees; and

     * (c) the calculation of the reportable fringe benefits amounts of those employees in respect of that employment.

##### 3  Interpretation 

    * (1) In this Act, unless the contrary intention appears:

    * **_Assessment Act_** means the _Fringe Benefits Tax Assessment Act 1986_.

    * **_Commonwealth employee_** means an employee of the Commonwealth.

    * **_Department_** means:

     * (a) a Department of State;

     * (b) a Department of the Parliament established under the _Parliamentary Service Act 1999_; or

     * (c) an Executive Agency or Statutory Agency (within the meaning of the _Public Service Act 1999_).

    * **_Entitlements Act _**means the _Veteran's Entitlements Act 1986._

    * _**_Finance Department_** means the Department that is administered by the Finance Minister.

    * **_Finance Minister_** has the meaning given by the _Income Tax Assessment Act 1997_.

    * **_responsible Department_**, in relation to the employment of a Commonwealth employee, means:

     * (a) where the remuneration in respect of that employment is or was paid wholly or principally out of money appropriated under an annual Appropriation Act--the Department in respect of which the money was appropriated; and

     * (b) where the remuneration in respect of that employment is or was paid wholly or principally out of money appropriated under an Act other than an annual Appropriation Act:

      * (i) if the employee performs or performed the duties of that employment in, or in respect of, a Department--that Department; or

      * (ii) in any other case--the Department of State administered by the Minister who administers the Act under which that money was appropriated, insofar as the Act appropriated that money; and

     * (c) where the remuneration in respect of that employment is or was paid wholly or principally out of money appropriated by the Constitution--the Finance Department.

    * (2) Unless the contrary intention appears, an expression that is used in this Act and in the Assessment Act has the same meaning in this Act as it has in the Assessment Act.

##### 4  Application of Assessment Act in relation to Commonwealth employment

    * Subject to this Act and to such modifications as are prescribed, the Assessment Act applies, in respect of any matter or thing in respect of the employment of a Commonwealth employee, as if:

     * (a) the employee were employed by the responsible Department and not by the Commonwealth;

     * (b) the responsible Department were a company and each other Department, and each authority of the Commonwealth, were a company related to the responsible Department; and

     * (c) the responsible Department were a government body.

##### 5  Application of Act to certain Commonwealth authorities

    * Subject to such modifications as are prescribed, this Act applies in relation to an authority of the Commonwealth referred to in paragraph (e) of the definition of **_employer_** in subsection 136(1) of the Assessment Act in like manner as it applies in relation to a Department.

##### 5A  Modified objection, review and appeal provisions

    * If, apart from this section, Part IVC of the _Taxation Administration Act 1953_ would apply to an objection made under the Assessment Act in its  application in accordance with this Act, then that Part applies as if  subsection 14ZX (4), section 14ZZ and Divisions 4 and 5 of that Part were omitted.

    * For the purposes of the application of the Assessment Act in accordance with this Act, where a benefit is provided under the _Defence Service Homes Act 1918 _in respect of the employment of a Commonwealth employee by reason of the employee being an eligible person within the meaning of that Act otherwise than by virtue of paragraph (h) or (i) of the definition of **_Australian Soldier_** in subsection 4(1) of that Act, the benefit is an exempt benefit.

##### 6AA  Exemption of benefits provided to certain people

    * For the purposes of the application of the Assessment Act in accordance with this Act, if a benefit (other than a benefit referred to in section 6) is provided, in respect of the employment of a Commonwealth employee, because of the employee being:

     * (b) a veteran as defined by subsection 5C(1) of the Entitlements Act who is eligible to receive a service pension, or in respect of whom a service pension is payable, under Part III of that Act; or

     * (c) a member of the Forces, or a member of a Peacekeeping Force, as defined by subsection 68(1) of the Entitlements Act to whom, or in respect of whom, pension is payable under Part IV of that Act; or

     * (d) a person who has received a lump sum under Part 2 of Chapter 4 of the _Military Rehabilitation and Compensation Act 2004_ or who is receiving payments under that Part; or

     * (e) a person who is receiving a Special Rate Disability Pension under Part 6 of Chapter 4 of the _Military Rehabilitation and Compensation Act 2004_;

    * the benefit is an exempt benefit.  

##### 6AB  Exemption of benefits provided to Commonwealth employees under the Entitlements Act and the Military Rehabilitation and Compensation Act

    * For the purposes of the application of the Assessment Act in accordance with this Act, if a benefit is provided under the Entitlements Act or the _Military Rehabilitation and Compensation Act 2004_, in respect of the employment of a Commonwealth employee, the benefit is an exempt  benefit.  

##### 6AC  Exemption of health care benefits provided to certain members of the Defence Force

    * (1) For the purposes of the application of the Assessment Act in accordance with this Act, if a benefit that consists of the provision of health care and is not otherwise an exempt benefit is provided, in respect of the employment of a Commonwealth employee, because of the employee being a member of the Defence Force, the firstmentioned benefit is an exempt benefit.  

    * (2) In this section, a reference to an employee being a member of the  Defence Force is a reference to an employee who is, was formerly, or will become, a member of the Defence Force.
