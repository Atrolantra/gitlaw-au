    * This Act commences on the day this Act receives the Royal Assent.

    * In this Act: 

    * **_administered assets and liabilities item_** means an amount set out in Schedule 2 in relation to a noncorporate entity opposite the heading "Administered Assets and Liabilities".

    * **_administered item_** means an amount set out in Schedule 2 opposite an outcome for a noncorporate entity under the heading "New Administered Outcomes".

    * **_corporate entity_** means:

     * (a) a corporate Commonwealth entity within the meaning of the _Public Governance, Performance and Accountability Act 2013_; or

     * (b) a Commonwealth company within the meaning of that Act.

    * **_corporate entity item_** means the amount set out in Schedule 2 in relation to a corporate entity under the heading "Nonoperating".

    * **_expenditure_** means payments for expenses, acquiring assets, making loans or paying liabilities.

    * **_Finance Minister_** means the Minister administering this Act.

    * **_item_** means any of the following:

     * (a) a State, ACT, NT and local government item;

     * (b) an administered item;

     * (c) an administered assets and liabilities item;

     * (d) an other departmental item;

     * (e) a corporate entity item.

    * **_noncorporate entity_** means:

     * (a) a noncorporate Commonwealth entity within the meaning of the _Public Governance, Performance and Accountability Act 2013_; or

     * (b) the High Court.

    * **_other departmental item_** means an amount set out in Schedule 2 in relation to a noncorporate entity opposite the heading "Equity Injections".

    * **_Portfolio Additional Estimates Statements_** means the Portfolio Additional Estimates Statements that were tabled in the Senate or the House of Representatives in relation to the Bill for this Act and the Bill for the _Appropriation Act (No. 3) 20142015_.

    * **_Portfolio Budget Statements_** means the Portfolio Budget Statements that were tabled in the Senate or the House of Representatives in relation to the Bill for the _Appropriation Act (No. 1) 20142015 _and the Bill for the _Appropriation Act (No. 2) 20142015_.

    * **_portfolio statements_** means:

     * (a) the Portfolio Budget Statements; and

     * (b) the Portfolio Additional Estimates Statements.

    * **_special account_** has the same meaning as in the _Public Governance, Performance and Accountability Act 2013_.

    * **_State, ACT, NT and local government item_** means an amount set out in Schedule 2 opposite an outcome for a noncorporate entity under the heading "Payments to States, ACT, NT and local government".

##### 4  Portfolio statements

       * Note: See paragraph 15AB(2)(g) of the _Acts Interpretation Act 1901_ which provides that the material that may be considered in the interpretation of a provision of an Act includes any document that is declared by the Act to be a relevant document.

##### 5  Notional transactions between entities that are part of the Commonwealth

    * For the purposes of this Act, notional transactions between noncorporate entities are to be treated as if they were real transactions.

       * Note: This section applies, for example, to a "payment" between noncorporate entities that are both part of the Commonwealth. One of the effects of this section is that the payment will be debited from an appropriation for the paying noncorporate entity, even though no payment is actually made from the Consolidated Revenue Fund. This is consistent with section 76 of the _Public Governance, Performance and Accountability Act 2013_.

### Part 2--Appropriation items

##### 6  Summary of appropriations

    * The total of the items specified in Schedule 2 is $240,789,000.

       * Note 2: Sections 30A and 31 of the _Financial Management and Accountability Act 1997_ also provide for adjustments of amounts appropriated by this Act. Those sections continue to apply because of Part 2 of Schedule 2 to the _Public Governance, Performance and Accountability (Consequential and Transitional Provisions) Act 2014_.

       * Note 3: Sections 74 and 75 of the _Public Governance, Performance and Accountability Act 2013_ also provide for the adjustment of amounts appropriated by this Act.

##### 7  State, ACT, NT and local government items

    * (1) The amount specified in a State, ACT, NT and local government item for an outcome for a noncorporate entity may be applied for the purpose of making payments to or for the States, the Australian Capital Territory, the Northern Territory and local government authorities for the purpose of contributing to achieving that outcome.

    * (2) If the portfolio statements indicate that activities of a particular kind were intended to be treated as activities in respect of a particular outcome, then expenditure for the purpose of carrying out those activities is taken to be expenditure for the purpose of contributing to achieving the outcome.

##### 8  Administered items

    * (1) The amount specified in an administered item for an outcome for a noncorporate entity may be applied for expenditure for the purpose of contributing to achieving that outcome.

    * (2) If the portfolio statements indicate that activities of a particular kind were intended to be treated as activities in respect of a particular outcome, then expenditure for the purpose of carrying out those activities is taken to be expenditure for the purpose of contributing to achieving the outcome.

##### 9  Administered assets and liabilities items

    * (1) The amount specified in an administered assets and liabilities item for a noncorporate entity may be applied for expenditure for the purpose of contributing to achieving any outcome specified for the entity:

     * (a) in Schedule 2 to this Act; or

     * (b) in Schedule 1 to the _Appropriation Act (No. 1) 20142015_; or

##### 10  Other departmental items

    * The amount specified in an other departmental item for a noncorporate entity may be applied for the departmental expenditure of the entity.

##### 11  Corporate entity items

    * (1) The amount specified in a corporate entity item for a corporate entity may be paid to the entity to be applied for the purposes of the entity.

    * (2) If:

     * (a) an Act provides that a corporate entity must be paid amounts that are appropriated by the Parliament for the purposes of the entity; and

     * (b) Schedule 2 contains a corporate entity item for that entity;

    * then the entity must be paid the full amount specified in the item.

### Part 3--Advance to the Finance Minister

##### 12  Advance to the Finance Minister

    * (1) If the Finance Minister determined an amount under subsection 12(2) of the _Appropriation Act (No. 2) 20142015_ before the commencement of this Act, the amount is to be disregarded for the purposes of subsection 12(3) of that Act.

       * Note: This means that, after the commencement of this Act, the Finance Minister has access to $380 million under section 12 of the _Appropriation Act (No. 2) 20142015_, regardless of amounts that have already been determined under that section.

    * (2) If:

     * (a) this Act appropriates an amount for particular expenditure; and

     * (b) before the commencement of this Act, the Finance Minister determines an amount (the **_advanced amount_**) under section 12 of the _Appropriation Act (No. 2) 20142015_ for the expenditure;

    * the amount appropriated by this Act for the expenditure is taken to be reduced (but not below nil) by the advanced amount.

### Part 4--Miscellaneous

##### 13  Crediting amounts to special accounts

    * If any of the purposes of a special account is a purpose that is covered by an item (whether or not the item expressly refers to the special account), then amounts may be debited against the appropriation for that item and credited to that special account.
