      * (a) has been convicted of an offence; or

      * (b) has been, or is about to be, charged with an offence;

    * the DPP may apply to the appropriate court for a restraining order against specified property of the defendant or of another person, or both.

    * (2) For the purposes of an application, the DPP may, on behalf of the Commonwealth, give the court such undertakings with respect to the payment of damages or costs, or both, as the court requires.

##### 49B  Making of restraining orders

    * (1) Subject to this Division, where an application is made for a restraining order against property and the appropriate court is satisfied that:

      * (a) the offence concerned is, or may be, a corruption offence; and

      * (b) if the defendant has been sentenced in respect of the offence--the sentence would support the making of an application for a superannuation order under subsection 45(1A); and

      * (c) the defendant is, or has been, a member of a superannuation scheme;

    * the court may, by order, direct that the property, or such part of the property as is specified in the order, is not to be disposed of, or otherwise dealt with, by any person except in the manner and circumstances (if any) specified in the order.

    * (2) A restraining order must not be made against a person's property to any extent greater than is necessary to ensure the recovery of any amount payable, or reasonably likely to be payable, by the defendant under a recovery order.

    * (3) Subsection (2) does not prevent the court from making a restraining order against a person's property, being property whose value is more than the amount payable, or reasonably likely to be payable, by the defendant under a recovery order if there is no other property of sufficient value in respect of which the court can make a restraining order.

    * (4) A court may make a restraining order against property whether or not there is any risk of the property being disposed of, or otherwise dealt with, in a manner that would defeat the operation of this Part.

    * (6) A court may refuse to make a restraining order if the Commonwealth refuses or fails to give the court such undertakings as the court considers appropriate with respect to the payment of damages or costs, or both, in relation to the making and operation of the order.
