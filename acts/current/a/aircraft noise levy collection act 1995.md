     * (a) each qualifying airport is declared a leviable airport as soon as practicable after it is identified as a qualifying airport; and

     * (b) as far as practicable, the adjusted levy liability for an airport at any given time does not exceed the Commonwealth expenditure on the noise amelioration program for the airport up to that time; and

     * (c) as far as practicable, the ratio of the adjusted levy liability for an airport to the Commonwealth expenditure on the noise amelioration program for the airport is ultimately the same for each leviable airport.

    * (5) The **_adjusted levy liability_** for an airport at a particular time is the sum of the amounts of levy for which operators of jet aircraft have incurred liability as a result of landings of those aircraft at the airport before that time (whether or not any of those amounts are due for payment and whether or not any of those amounts have been paid) minus the amount spent up to that time on collection of levy on landings at the airport.
