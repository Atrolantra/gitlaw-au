### An Act to impose a levy on authorised deposit-taking institutions


   * 1**  Short title **[_see_ Note 1]

   * This Act may be cited as the_ Authorised Deposit-taking Institutions Supervisory Levy Imposition Act 1998_.

   * 2**  Commencement **[_see_ Note 1]

   * (1) Subject to subsection (2), this Act commences on a day to be fixed by Proclamation.

   * (2) If this Act does not commence under subsection (1) within the period of 24 months beginning on the day on which this Act receives the Royal Assent, it commences on the first day after the end of that period.

   * (3) If this Act commences during a financial year (but not on 1 July of that financial year), this Act has effect in relation to that financial year subject to the modifications specified in the regulations.

##### 3  Act binds the Crown

   * This Act binds the Crown in each of its capacities.

##### 4  External Territories

   * This Act extends to each external Territory.

##### 5  Definitions

   * In this Act, unless the contrary intention appears:

   * **_ADI_** has the same meaning as in the _Banking Act 1959_.

     * Note: ADI is short for authorised deposit-taking institution.

   * **_indexation factor_** means the indexation factor calculated under section 8.

   * **_index number_**, in relation to a quarter, means the All Groups Consumer Price Index number, being the weighted average of the 8 capital cities, published by the Australian Statistician in respect of that quarter.

   * **_levy imposition day_**, in relation to an ADI for a financial year, means:

    * (a) if the ADI is an ADI on 1 July of the financial year--that day; or

    * (b) in any other case--the day, during the financial year, on which the ADI becomes an ADI.

   * **_statutory upper limit_** means:

    * (a) in relation to the financial year commencing on 1 July 2005--$1,500,000; or

    * (b) in relation to a later financial year--the amount calculated by multiplying the statutory upper limit for the previous financial year by the indexation factor for the later financial year.

##### 6  Imposition of authorised deposit-taking institutions supervisory levy

   * Levy payable in accordance with subsection 8(1) of the _Financial Institutions Supervisory Levies Collection Act 1998_ is imposed.

##### 7  Amount of levy

   * (1) Subject to subsection (2), the amount of levy payable by an ADI for a financial year is the sum of the restricted levy component and the unrestricted levy component for the financial year.

     * Note: For **_restricted levy component_**, see subsection (1A). For **_unrestricted levy component_**, see subsection (1B).

   * (1A) The **_restricted levy component_** for the financial year is:

    * (a) unless paragraph (b) or (c) applies--the amount that, for the financial year, is the restricted levy percentage of the ADI's levy base; or

    * (b) if the amount worked out under paragraph (a) exceeds the maximum restricted levy amount for the financial year--the maximum restricted levy amount; or

    * (c) if the amount worked out under paragraph (a) is less than the minimum restricted levy amount for the financial year--the minimum restricted levy amount.

     * Note: The restricted levy percentage, maximum restricted levy amount, minimum restricted levy amount and the method of working out the ADI's levy base are as determined under subsection (3).

   * (1B) The **_unrestricted levy component _**for the financial year is the amount that, for the financial year, is the unrestricted levy percentage of the ADI's levy base.

     * Note: The unrestricted percentage is as determined under subsection (3).

   * (2) If the levy imposition day for the ADI for the financial year is later than 1 July in the financial year, the amount of levy payable by the ADI for the financial year is the amount worked out using the following formula:

   * (3) The Treasurer is, by legislative instrument, to determine:

    * (a) the **_maximum restricted levy amount_** for each financial year; and

    * (b) the **_minimum restricted levy amount_** for each financial year; and

    * (c) the **_restricted levy percentage _**for each financial year; and

    * (ca) the **_unrestricted levy percentage _**for each financial year; and

    * (d) how an **_ADI's levy base_** is to be worked out.

   * (4) An amount determined under subsection (3) as the maximum restricted levy amount must not exceed the statutory upper limit as at the time when the determination is made.

   * (5) The Treasurer's determination under paragraph (3)(d) of how an ADI's levy base is to be worked out is to include, but is not limited to, a determination of the day as at which the ADI's levy base is to be worked out. That day must be:

    * (a) if the ADI was an ADI at all times from and including 17 March of the previous financial year to and including the following 30 June--a day in the period from and including that 17 March to and including the following 14 April; or

    * (b) if the ADI was not an ADI at all times from and including 17 March of the previous financial year to and including the following 30 June--the day after that 17 March when the ADI became, or becomes, an ADI.

   * (6) A determination under subsection (3) may make different provision for different classes of ADIs.

##### 8  Calculation of indexation factor 

   * (1) The indexation factor for a financial year is the number worked out by:

    * (a) dividing the index number for the March quarter immediately preceding that financial year by the index number for the March quarter immediately preceding that first-mentioned March quarter; and

    * (b) adding 0.030 to the number worked out under paragraph (a).

   * (2) The indexation factor is to be calculated to 3 decimal places, but increased by .001 if the 4th decimal place is more than 4.

   * (3) Calculations under paragraph (1)(a):

    * (a) are to be made using only the index numbers published in terms of the most recently published reference base for the Consumer Price Index; and

    * (b) are to be made disregarding index numbers that are published in substitution for previously published index numbers (except where the substituted numbers are published to take account of changes in the reference base).

##### 9  Regulations

   * The Governor-General may make regulations for the purposes of subsection 2(3).
