#### Division 2--Objects

##### 21  The objects of this Act

    * (1) The objects of this Act, in conjunction with the _Aged Care Act 1997_, are as follows:

     * (a) to provide for funding of *aged care that takes account of:

      * (i) the quality of the care; and

      * (ii) the *type of care and level of care provided; and

      * (iii) the need to ensure access to care that is affordable by, and appropriate to the needs of, people who require it; and

      * (iv) appropriate outcomes for recipients of the care; and

      * (v) accountability of the providers of the care for the funding and for the outcomes for recipients;

     * (b) to promote a high quality of care and accommodation for the recipients of *aged care services that meets the needs of individuals;

     * (c) to protect the health and wellbeing of the recipients of aged care services;

     * (d) to ensure that aged care services are targeted towards the people with the greatest needs for those services;

     * (e) to facilitate access to aged care services by those who need them, regardless of race, culture, language, gender, economic circumstance or geographic location;

     * (f) to provide respite for families, and others, who care for older people;

     * (g) to encourage diverse, flexible and responsive aged care services that:

      * (i) are appropriate to meet the needs of the recipients of those services and the carers of those recipients; and

      * (ii) facilitate the independence of, and choice available to, those recipients and carers;

     * (h) to help those recipients to enjoy the same rights as all other people in Australia;

     * (i) to plan effectively for the delivery of aged care services that:

      * (i) promote the targeting of services to areas of the greatest need and people with the greatest need; and

      * (ii) avoid duplication of those services; and

      * (iii) improve the integration of the planning and delivery of aged care services with the planning and delivery of related health and community services;

     * (j) to promote ageing in place through the linking of care and support services to the places where older people prefer to live.

    * (2) In construing the objects, due regard must be had to:

     * (a) the limited resources available to support services and programs under this Act and the _Aged Care Act 1997_; and

     * (b) the need to consider equity and merit in accessing those resources.

#### Division 3--Overview of this Act

##### 31  General

    * This Act, in conjunction with the _Aged Care Act 1997_, provides for the Commonwealth to give financial support:

     * (a) through payment of subsidies for the provision of *aged care; and

     * (b) through payment of grants for other matters connected with the provision of aged care.

    * Subsidies are paid under Chapter 3 of this Act and Chapter 3 of the _Aged Care Act 1997_ (but Chapters 2 and 4 of the _Aged Care Act 1997_ and Chapter 4 of this Act are also relevant to subsidies), and grants are paid under Chapter 5 of the _Aged Care Act 1997_.

##### 32  Preliminary matters relating to subsidies

    * Before the Commonwealth can pay subsidy to a provider of *aged care under Chapter 3 of this Act, a number of approvals and similar decisions may need to have been made under Chapter 2 of the _Aged Care Act 1997_. These may relate to:

     * (a) the provider (for example, the requirement that the provider be an approved provider); or

     * (b) the *aged care service in question (for example, the requirement that *places have been allocated in respect of the service); or

     * (c) the recipient of aged care (for example, the requirement that the recipient has been approved as a recipient of the type of aged care that is provided).

##### 33  Subsidies (Chapter 3)

    * A number of different kinds of subsidy can be paid under Chapter 3 of this Act. They are paid for *aged care that has been provided. Eligibility for a subsidy depends on:

     * (a) particular approvals and similar decisions having been made under Chapter 2 of the _Aged Care Act 1997_; and

     * (b) the circumstances in which the care is provided (for example, whether the care is provided in a residential care service that meets its *accreditation requirement).

##### 34  Responsibilities of approved providers

    * Approved providers have certain responsibilities under Chapter 4 of this Act and Chapter 4 of the _Aged Care Act 1997_. These responsibilities relate to:

     * (a) the quality of care they provide; and

     * (b) user rights for the people to whom care is provided; and

     * (c) accountability for the care that is provided, and the basic suitability of their *key personnel.

    * Failure to meet these responsibilities can lead to the imposition of sanctions that affect the status of approvals and similar decisions under Chapter 2 of the _Aged Care Act 1997_ (and therefore may affect amounts of subsidy payable to an approved provider).

##### 35  Grants

    * The Commonwealth makes grants under Chapter 5 of the _Aged Care Act 1997_ to contribute to costs associated with:

     * (a) the establishment or enhancement of *aged care services (for example, *residential care grants); or

     * (c) support services related to the provision of aged care (for example, *advocacy grants).

    * The grants are (in most cases) payable under agreements with the recipients of the grants, and may be subject to conditions.

#### Division 4--Application of this Act

##### 41  Application of this Act

    * (1) This Act applies in all the States and Territories.

    * (2) However, this Act does not apply in any external Territory, except the Territory of Christmas Island and the Territory of Cocos (Keeling) Islands.

    * (3) Despite subsection (1), Part 3.1 applies in relation to the Territory of Christmas Island and the Territory of Cocos (Keeling) Islands as if those Territories were part of Western Australia and were not Territories.

        * Note: This has the effect that references in Part 3.1 to a Territory do not apply to the Territory of Christmas Island or the Territory of Cocos (Keeling) Islands, and that references in that Part to a State will be relevant to Western Australia as if it included those Territories.

##### 42  Binding the Crown

    * (1) This Act binds the Crown in each of its capacities.

    * (2) This Act does not make the Crown liable to be prosecuted for an offence.

## Chapter 3--Subsidies

#### Division 40--Introduction

##### 401  What this Chapter is about

    * The Commonwealth pays subsidies to approved providers for *aged care that has been provided. These subsidies are:

     *  	*residential care subsidy (see Part 3.1);

     *  	*home care subsidy (see Part 3.2);

     *  	*flexible care subsidy (see Part 3.3).

    * A number of approvals and other decisions may need to have been made under Chapter 2 of the _Aged Care Act 1997 _before a particular kind of payment can be made (see section 52 of that Act). Receipt of payments under this Chapter gives rise to certain responsibilities, that are dealt with in Chapter 4 of this Act and Chapter 4 of the _Aged Care Act 1997_.

### Part 3.1--Residential care subsidy

      * (ii) meals and cleaning services; and

      * (iii) furnishings, furniture and equipment for the provision of that care and accommodation; and

     * (c) care provided in a facility that primarily provides care to people who are not frail and aged;

#### Division 42--Who is eligible for residential care subsidy?

     * (b) the approved provider provides residential care to a care recipient in respect of whom an approval is in force under Part 2.3 of the _Aged Care Act 1997 _as a recipient of residential care; and

     * (c) the residential care service through which the care is provided meets its *accreditation requirement (if any) applying at that time (see section 424 of the _Aged Care Act 1997_).

        * Note 1: A care recipient can be taken to be provided with residential care while he or she is on *leave from that care (see section 422).

        * Note 2: If the care recipient's approval under Part 2.3 of the _Aged Care Act 1997 _is not in force, subsidy will not be payable. (For example, the approval may have been given only for a limited period.)

    * (2) However, the approved provider is not eligible in respect of residential care provided to the care recipient during that day if:

     * (a) it is excluded because the approved provider exceeds the approved provider's allocation of *places for residential care subsidy (see section 427); or

     * (b) the approved provider stopped providing residential care to the person during that day; or

     * (c) subject to subsections (3) and (4), another approved provider would, but for this paragraph, also be eligible for *residential care subsidy in respect of residential care provided to the same care recipient during that day.

    * (3) Paragraph (2)(c) does not apply if the approved provider started providing residential care to the care recipient before the other approved provider.

    * (4) Paragraph (2)(c) does not apply if:

     * (a) the care recipient is on *leave under section 422 from the residential care service through which the approved provider provides residential care to the care recipient at a level that is not a *high level of residential care; and

     * (b) the care recipient's approval under Part 2.3 of the _Aged Care Act 1997_ is not limited under subsection 222(3) of that Act to a *low level of residential care; and

     * (c) the other approved provider is providing to the care recipient, on a temporary basis, a high level of residential care; and

     * (d) the approved provider referred to in paragraph (a) is unable to provide that high level of residential care.

        * Note: Eligibility may also be affected by Division 7 of the _Aged Care Act 1997 _(relating to a person's approval as a provider of aged care services) or Division 20 of that Act (relating to a person's approval as a recipient of residential care).

##### 422  Leave from residential care services

    * (1) On each day during which a care recipient is on *leave under this section from a residential care service, the care recipient is taken, for the purposes of this Part (other than section 423) and for the purposes of section 67A5 of the _Aged Care Act 1997_, to be provided with residential care by the approved provider operating the residential care service.

    * (2) A care recipient is on *leave under this section from a residential care service on each day of any period during which the care recipient attends a hospital for the purpose of receiving hospital treatment, so long as the day is on or after the day on which the care recipient *enters the residential care service.

        * Note: Attending a hospital for a period of extended hospital leave may result in the Minister determining a lower basic subsidy amount for the recipient for days occurring during that period, which will affect the amount of subsidy that is payable (see section 443).

    * (3) A care recipient is on *leave under this section from a residential care service on a day if:

     * (a) during the whole of that day, the care recipient is absent from the residential care service; and

     * (b) either:

      * (i) the care recipient does not, during that day, attend a hospital for the purpose of receiving hospital treatment; or

      * (ii) the care recipient does, during that day, attend a hospital for that purpose and the day is before the day on which the care recipient *enters the residential care service; and

     * (c) the number of days on which the care recipient has previously been on leave under this subsection, during the current financial year, is less than 52.

        * Note: If a care recipient is taken not to have been provided with care because the maximum number of days has been exceeded, subsidy will not be payable in respect of those days. However, the care recipient may agree to pay a fee to the approved provider to reserve the care recipient's *place in the service. The maximum amount in such a case is set by section 586.

    * (3A) A care recipient is on *leave under this section from a residential care service on a day if:

     * (a) *flexible care subsidy is payable in respect of the care recipient and the day; and

     * (b) the requirements specified in the Aged Care (Transitional Provisions) Principles for the purposes of this paragraph are met.

        * Note: If a care recipient is on leave for at least 30 days continuously under subsections (2) and (3A), this may result in the Minister determining a lower basic subsidy amount for the recipient for days occurring during that period, which will affect the amount of residential care subsidy that is payable (see section 443).

    * (4) Despite subsections (2), (3) and (3A), a care recipient cannot be on *leave under this section from a residential care service during any period during which the residential care in question would have been *respite care.

##### 423  Working out periods of leave

    * (1) In working out the days on which a care recipient is on *leave under section 422:

     * (a) include the day on which the period commenced; and

     * (b) do not include the day on which the approved provider recommenced, or commenced, providing residential care to the care recipient.

        * Note: Absences that do not include an overnight absence from a residential care service are not counted as *leave because of paragraph (b).

    * (2) Subject to subsection (3), a care recipient cannot be on *leave under section 422 from a residential care service before he or she *enters the service.

    * (3) A care recipient may be on leave under section 422 on the days during the period starting on the later of:

     * (a) the day on which he or she was notified that there was a vacancy in the residential care service in question; or

     * (aa) the day on which he or she accepted a place in the residential care service; or

     * (b) the day that is 7 days, or such other period as is specified in the Aged Care (Transitional Provisions) Principles, before the day on which the person *enters the residential care service;

    * and ending on the day of entry.

##### 427  Exceeding the number of places for which there is an allocation

    * (1) For the purposes of a person's eligibility for *residential care subsidy, residential care provided to a particular care recipient on a particular day is excluded if:

     * (b) the Secretary decides, in accordance with subsection (2), that the residential care provided to that particular care recipient on that day is to be excluded.

    * (2) In deciding under paragraph (1)(b) which residential care is to be excluded, the Secretary must:

     * (a) make the number of exclusions necessary to ensure that the number of *places for which *residential care subsidy will be payable does not exceed the number of places included in the approved provider's allocation of places for residential care subsidy; and

     * (b) exclude the residential care in the reverse order in which the care recipients *entered the residential care service for the provision of residential care.

##### 428  Notice of refusal to pay residential care subsidy

    * (2) A notice given under subsection (1) is not a legislative instrument.

#### Division 43--How is residential care subsidy paid?

##### 431  Payment of residential care subsidy

    * (1) Residential care subsidy is payable by the Commonwealth to an approved provider in respect of each *payment period (see section 432) during which the approved provider is eligible under section 421. However, it is not payable in respect of any days during that period on which the approved provider is not eligible.

    * (2) Residential care subsidy is separately payable by the Commonwealth in respect of each residential care service through which the approved provider provides residential care.

    * (3) The Secretary may, in accordance with the Aged Care (Transitional Provisions) Principles, deduct from the amount of residential care subsidy otherwise payable in respect of a *payment period such of the following amounts as apply to the residential care service in question:

     * (b) *capital repayment deductions (see section 436);

     * (d) noncompliance deductions (see section 438).

    * (2) The Secretary must work out the amount of an advance to be paid to an approved provider in respect of the first *payment period or the second payment period for a residential care service by estimating the amount of *residential care subsidy that will be payable for the days in that period.

    * (3) The Secretary must work out the amount of an advance to be paid to an approved provider in respect of subsequent *payment periods for a residential care service by:

     * (a) estimating the amount of *residential care subsidy that will be payable (taking into account any deductions under subsection 431(3)) for the days in the period; and

     * (b) increasing or reducing that amount to make any adjustments that the Secretary reasonably believes are necessary to take account of likely underpayments or overpayments in respect of advances previously paid under this section.

    * (4) The amounts of advances must be worked out in accordance with any requirements set out in the Aged Care (Transitional Provisions) Principles.

    * (5) The Secretary may, in deciding whether to reduce the amount of an advance under paragraph (3)(b), take into account the likelihood of the Commonwealth's right to recover a particular overpayment being waived under section 956 of the _Aged Care Act 1997_.

        * Note: Subsection (5) allows the Secretary to take account of waivers in respect of overpayments caused, for example, by some cases of incorrect determinations of the *ordinary incomes of care recipients.

##### 434  Claims for residential care subsidy

    * (1) For the purpose of obtaining payment of *residential care subsidy in respect of a residential care service through which an approved provider provides residential care, the approved provider must, as soon as practicable after the end of each *payment period, give to the Secretary:

    * (2) An advance of *residential care subsidy is not payable in respect of a *payment period for the residential care service if the approved provider has not given to the Secretary under subsection (1) a claim relating to the second last preceding payment period for the service.

        * Example: An advance of subsidy is not payable for March if the Secretary has not been given a claim for January of the same year (assuming the *payment periods are all calendar months--see section 432).

    * (3) Subsection (2) does not apply to the first *payment period or the second payment period for a residential care service.

    * (4) If all the places in a residential care service are transferred from one person to another, subsection (2) does not apply to the first 2 *payment periods for the residential care service that occur after the transfer took effect.

    * (5) If:

     * (a) apart from this subsection, the operation of paragraph (1)(c) would result in the acquisition of property from a person otherwise than on just terms; and

    * (2) In determining a longer period for the purposes of paragraph (1)(b), the Secretary must be satisfied that a variation is required:

     * (a) due to an administrative error made by the Commonwealth or an agent of the Commonwealth; or

     * (b) because the Commonwealth or an agent of the Commonwealth considers that the circumstances of a care recipient are different from those on the basis of which subsidy was claimed.

        * Note: Determinations of periods under paragraph (1)(b) are reviewable under Part 6.1.

    * (3) A determination made under paragraph (1)(b) is not a legislative instrument.

     * (b) so far as amounts are so deducted, the approved provider ceases to be liable to the Commonwealth for repayment in respect of the capital payments.

        * Note: Entering into such an agreement may be a condition of the granting of *extra service status (see paragraph 328(5)(b) of the _Aged Care Act 1997_).

    * (3) However, only a proportion of the amounts equal to the capital payments made in respect of the service are to be deducted under the agreement if:

     * (a) *extra service status is granted only in respect of a *distinct part of the service; or

     * (b) some or all of the capital payments were made more than 5 years before the first of the deductions is to be made; or

    * (3A) A notice given under subsection (3) is not a legislative instrument.

    * (4) The amount of a noncompliance deduction is the amount worked out in accordance with the Aged Care (Transitional Provisions) Principles.

##### Subdivision 44A--Working out the amount of residential care subsidy

##### 442  Amount of residential care subsidy

    * (4) The value of a care recipient's assets is to be worked out in the same way as it would be worked out under section 4410 for the purposes of section 445B, 447 or 448.

    * (5) However, subsections (1), (2) and (3) are modified as described in the table, and subsection (4) does not apply, if, before entering the *accommodation bond agreement, the care recipient gives the approved provider a copy of a determination that:

     * (a) is a determination under section 448AB of the value of the care recipient's assets at a time (the **_valuation time_**) that is before or at the time (the **_entry time_**) the care recipient *enters the residential care service or flexible care service; and

     * (b) is in force at the entry time, if that is after the valuation time.

##### 5713  Maximum amount of accommodation bond if care recipient moves between certain aged care services

    * If: 

     * (a) an *accommodation bond has been paid by a care recipient for *entry to an aged care service (the **_original service_**) that is a residential care service or a flexible care service; and

     * (b) the care recipient ceases being provided with residential care, or flexible care, through the original service (other than because the care recipient is on *leave); and

     * (c) the care recipient enters another aged care service that is a residential care service or a flexible care service within 28 days after the day on which the care recipient ceased being provided with care by the original service;

    * the maximum amount of the accommodation bond for the entry of the care recipient to the other service is the amount of the accommodation bond balance that was refunded or is payable to the care recipient under Division 52P of the _Aged Care Act 1997_ in respect of the accommodation bond referred to in paragraph (a).

##### 5714  Accommodation bond in cases of financial hardship

    * (1) The Secretary may determine, in accordance with the Aged Care (Transitional Provisions) Principles, that a person:

     * (a) must not be charged an *accommodation bond because payment of an accommodation bond would cause the person financial hardship; or

     * (b) must not be charged an accommodation bond of more than a specified maximum amount because payment of more than that amount would cause the person financial hardship.

        * Note: Refusals to make determinations are reviewable under Part 6.1.

    * The application is taken to have been withdrawn if the information is not given within whichever of those periods applies. The notice must contain a statement setting out the effect of this subsection.

        * Note: The period for giving the further information can be extended--see section 967.

    * (6) The Secretary must notify the person and the approved provider, in writing, of the Secretary's decision on whether to make the determination. The notice must be given:

##### 5715  Revocation of determinations of financial hardship

    * (1) The Secretary may, in accordance with the Aged Care (Transitional Provisions) Principles, revoke a determination made under section 5714.

    * **	**(3)	In making the decision whether to revoke the determination, the Secretary must consider any submissions received within the period for making submissions. The Secretary must make the decision within 28 days after the end of that period.

    * **	**(4)	The Secretary must notify, in writing, the person and the approved provider of the decision.

    * (5) The notice must be given to the person and the approved provider within 28 days after the end of the period for making submissions. If the notice is not given within that period, the Secretary is taken to have decided not to revoke the determination.

    * **	**(6)	A revocation has effect:

     * (a) if the person and the approved provider received notice under subsection (4) on the same day--the day after that day; or

##### Subdivision 57E--Payment of accommodation bonds

     * (b) if no period is specified--before the end of 6 months;

    * after *entry to the residential care service or flexible care service.

        * Note: However, under sections 5718 and 5720, amounts representing income derived and retention amounts are payable from the date a care recipient *enters a residential care service or a flexible care service.

##### 5717  Payment of an accommodation bond by periodic payments

    * (1) A care recipient may elect that an *accommodation bond is to be paid, in whole or in part, by periodic payments.

    * (2) The Aged Care (Transitional Provisions) Principles may specify:

     * (a) the frequency of periodic payments; and

     * (b) the method for working out amounts of periodic payments (including a method where only part of the *accommodation bond is to be paid by periodic payments); and

     * (c) any other matters relating to periodic payments.

    * (3) The method specified in the Aged Care (Transitional Provisions) Principles for working out amounts of periodic payments must have regard to:

     * (a) the income that the approved provider could be expected to have derived; and

     * (b) the retention amounts that would have been permitted to be deducted under section 5720;

    * if the *accommodation bond had been paid as a lump sum.

##### Subdivision 57F--Rights of approved providers

##### 5718  Approved provider may retain income derived

    * (1) An approved provider may retain income derived from the investment of an *accommodation bond balance in respect of an *accommodation bond paid to the approved provider.

    * (2) Despite section 5716, if a care recipient pays an *accommodation bond to an approved provider after the due date (see subsection (6)), the care recipient may be required to pay to the approved provider an amount representing the income the approved provider could be expected to have derived, through investing the *accommodation bond balance, during the period:

     * (a) beginning on the due date; and

     * (b) ending on the day on which the *accommodation bond was paid.

    * (3) If the care recipient is provided with care for 2 months or less, the care recipient may be required to pay to the approved provider an amount representing the income the approved provider could be expected to have derived, through investing the *accommodation bond balance, during:

     * (a) the whole of the month in which the care recipient *entered the residential care service or flexible care service; and 

     * (b) the 2 following months;

    * unless the Aged Care (Transitional Provisions) Principles specify that a lesser amount is payable. 

        * Example: If a care recipient *entered a residential care service on 20 January and left on 3 March, the amount would be the amount the approved provider could have been expected to have derived if the care recipient received care for the whole of January, February and March.

    * (4) The Aged Care (Transitional Provisions) Principles may specify a method for working out the amounts referred to in subsections (2) and (3).

    * (5) The Aged Care (Transitional Provisions) Principles may provide that, in the circumstances specified in the Aged Care (Transitional Provisions) Principles, an approved provider must not retain income derived, from the investment of an *accommodation bond balance, in respect of periods specified in the Aged Care (Transitional Provisions) Principles.

    * (6) In this section:

    * **_due date_** means:

     * (a) in relation to an *accommodation bond payable by a care recipient for *entry to a residential care service--the day on which the care recipient entered the residential care service; or

     * (b) in relation to an accommodation bond payable by a care recipient for entry to a flexible care service--the day on which the care recipient entered the flexible care service.

##### 5719  Amounts to be deducted from accommodation bond balance

    * (1) An approved provider to whom an *accommodation bond was paid by a care recipient may deduct from the *accommodation bond balance:

     * (a) retention amounts in respect of the accommodation bond (see section 5720); and

     * (b) amounts owed to the approved provider by the care recipient under an *accommodation bond agreement, a *resident agreement or an *extra service agreement; and

     * (c) amounts, worked out in accordance with the Aged Care (Transitional Provisions) Principles, representing interest on the amounts referred to in paragraph (b).

    * (2) The approved provider must not deduct any other amounts from the *accommodation bond balance.

##### 5720  Retention amounts

    * (1) A retention amount must not exceed the amount specified in, or worked out in accordance with, the Aged Care (Transitional Provisions) Principles.

    * (2) The Aged Care (Transitional Provisions) Principles may provide that, in the circumstances specified in the Aged Care (Transitional Provisions) Principles, an approved provider must not deduct any amounts from an *accommodation bond balance in respect of periods specified in the Aged Care (Transitional Provisions) Principles.

    * (3) Subject to subsections (4) and (5), a retention amount may be deducted from an *accommodation bond balance for each month, or part of a month, during which the care recipient concerned is:

     * (a) provided with residential care through the residential care service in respect of which the *accommodation bond was paid; or

     * (b) provided with flexible care through the flexible care service in respect of which the accommodation bond was paid.

    * (4) Subject to subsection (5), retention amounts may only be deducted during the period of 5 years, or such other period specified in the Aged Care (Transitional Provisions) Principles, starting on the latest of the following days:

     * (a) the day on which the care recipient *entered the residential care service or flexible care service;

     * (c) if a determination under paragraph 5714(1)(a) is in force in respect of the care recipient--the day after the day on which the determination ceases to be in force;

     * (d) such other day as is worked out in accordance with the Aged Care (Transitional Provisions) Principles.

    * (5) If, before the *accommodation bond was paid, amounts had already been deducted from an *accommodation bond balance in respect of another accommodation bond previously paid by the care recipient, the period of 5 years referred to in subsection (4) is reduced by each month in respect of which a retention amount was so deducted.

        * Note: The effect of this subsection is that all periods spent in residential care or flexible care after an *accommodation bond is first paid will count towards the 5 year maximum under subsection (4) for deducting retention amounts.

        * Example: If a care recipient initially spends 6 weeks in residential care and then moves to another residential care service, retention amounts can be deducted for 3 months in respect of the 6 weeks of care (see subsection (6)), but after that only for up to 4 years and 9 months.

    * (6) For the purposes of this section, if the care recipient is provided with care for 2 months or less, the care recipient is taken, for the purposes of working out retention amounts payable, to have received that care during:

     * (a) the whole of the month in which the care recipient *entered the residential care service or flexible care service; and 

     * (b) the 2 following months;

    * unless the Aged Care (Transitional Provisions) Principles specify that care is taken to have been provided for a shorter period.

        * Example: A care recipient who *entered a residential care service on 20 January and left on 3 March would be taken to have received care for the whole of January, February and March. Therefore, retention amounts could be deducted for each of these months.

    * (7) Deduction of retention amounts must comply with any other requirements specified in the Aged Care (Transitional Provisions) Principles.

##### Subdivision 57H--Charging an accommodation bond instead of an accommodation charge

##### 5723  Charging an accommodation bond instead of an accommodation charge

    * (1) This section applies if:

     * (a) a care recipient has entered into an *accommodation bond agreement (the **_original agreement_**) for *entry to an aged care service (the **_original service_**) that is a residential care service or a flexible care service; and

     * (b) the care recipient ceases being provided with residential care or flexible care through the original service (other than because the care recipient is on *leave); and

     * (c) within 28 days after the cessation, the care recipient enters another aged care service (the **_later service_**) that is a residential care service or a flexible care service and for which entry an *accommodation charge would become payable (disregarding subparagraph 57A2(1)(a)(iv)); and

     * (d) the approved provider of the later service and the care recipient agreed, before the care recipient entered the later service, that an accommodation bond, instead of an accommodation charge, can be charged for the entry of the person to the later service.

    * (2) If this section applies:

     * (a) the approved provider of the later service can charge an *accommodation bond for the *entry of the person to the later service; and

     * (b) if the care recipient has paid the full amount of the accommodation bond relating to the original agreement--the maximum amount of the new accommodation bond is the amount of the accommodation bond balance that was refunded or is payable to the care recipient under Division 52P of the _Aged Care Act 1997_ in respect of the accommodation bond relating to the original agreement; and

     * (c) in any other case--the maximum amount of the new accommodation bond is the amount of the accommodation bond that was payable under the original agreement, less any retention amounts that would have been permitted to be deducted under section 5720 in respect of the original service if the accommodation bond had been paid as a lump sum.
