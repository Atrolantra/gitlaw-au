##### [Assented to 26 June 2015]

### The Parliament of Australia enacts: 

### Part 1--Preliminary

##### 1  Short title

    * This Act may be cited as the _Appropriation Act (No. 5) 20142015_.

##### 2  Commencement

    * This Act commences on the day this Act receives the Royal Assent.

##### 3  Definitions

    * In this Act: 

    * **_administered item_** means an amount set out in Schedule 1 opposite an outcome for a noncorporate entity under the heading "Administered".

    * **_corporate entity_** means:

     * (a) a corporate Commonwealth entity within the meaning of the _Public Governance, Performance and Accountability Act 2013_; or

     * (b) a Commonwealth company within the meaning of that Act.

    * **_corporate entity item_** means the total amount set out in Schedule 1 in relation to a corporate entity under the heading "Administered".

      * Note: The amounts set out opposite outcomes for corporate entities, under the heading "Administered", are "notional". They are not part of the item, and do not in any way restrict the scope of the expenditure authorised by the item.

    * **_departmental item_** means the total amount set out in Schedule 1 in relation to a noncorporate entity under the heading "Departmental".

      * Note: The amounts set out opposite outcomes, under the heading "Departmental", are "notional". They are not part of the item, and do not in any way restrict the scope of the expenditure authorised by the item.

    * **_expenditure_** means payments for expenses, acquiring assets, making loans or paying liabilities.

    * **_Finance Minister_** means the Minister administering this Act.

    * **_item_** means any of the following:

     * (a) an administered item;

     * (b) a corporate entity item;

     * (c) a departmental item.

    * **_noncorporate entity_** means:

     * (a) a noncorporate Commonwealth entity within the meaning of the _Public Governance, Performance and Accountability Act 2013_; or

     * (b) the High Court.

    * **_Portfolio Additional Estimates Statements_** means the Portfolio Additional Estimates Statements that were tabled in the Senate or the House of Representatives in relation to the Bill for the _Appropriation Act (No. 3) 20142015 _and the Bill for the _Appropriation Act (No. 4) 20142015_.

    * **_Portfolio Budget Statements_** means the Portfolio Budget Statements that were tabled in the Senate or the House of Representatives in relation to the Bill for the _Appropriation Act (No. 1) 20142015 _and the Bill for the _Appropriation Act (No. 2) 20142015_.

    * **_portfolio statements_** means:

     * (a) the Portfolio Budget Statements; and

     * (b) the Portfolio Additional Estimates Statements; and

     * (c) the Portfolio Supplementary Additional Estimates Statements.

    * **_Portfolio Supplementary Additional Estimates Statements_** means the Portfolio Supplementary Additional Estimates Statements that were tabled in the Senate or the House of Representatives in relation to the Bill for this Act and the Bill for the _Appropriation Act (No. 6) 20142015_.

    * **_special account_** has the same meaning as in the _Public Governance, Performance and Accountability Act 2013_.

##### 4  Portfolio statements

    * The portfolio statements are declared to be relevant documents for the purposes of section 15AB of the _Acts Interpretation Act 1901_.

      * Note: See paragraph 15AB(2)(g) of the _Acts Interpretation Act 1901_ which provides that the material that may be considered in the interpretation of a provision of an Act includes any document that is declared by the Act to be a relevant document.

##### 5  Notional transactions between entities that are part of the Commonwealth

    * For the purposes of this Act, notional transactions between noncorporate entities are to be treated as if they were real transactions.

      * Note: This section applies, for example, to a "payment" between noncorporate entities that are both part of the Commonwealth. One of the effects of this section is that the payment will be debited from an appropriation for the paying noncorporate entity, even though no payment is actually made from the Consolidated Revenue Fund. This is consistent with section 76 of the _Public Governance, Performance and Accountability Act 2013_.

### Part 2--Appropriation items

##### 6  Summary of appropriations

    * The total of the items specified in Schedule 1 is $376,690,000.

      * Note 1: Items in Schedule 1 can be adjusted under Part 3 of this Act.

      * Note 2: Sections 30A and 31 of the _Financial Management and Accountability Act 1997_ also provide for adjustments of amounts appropriated by this Act. Those sections continue to apply because of Part 2 of Schedule 2 to the _Public Governance, Performance and Accountability (Consequential and Transitional Provisions) Act 2014_.

      * Note 3: Sections 74 and 75 of the _Public Governance, Performance and Accountability Act 2013_ also provide for the adjustment of amounts appropriated by this Act.

##### 7  Departmental items

    * The amount specified in a departmental item for a noncorporate entity may be applied for the departmental expenditure of the entity.

##### 8  Administered items

    * (1) The amount specified in an administered item for an outcome for a noncorporate entity may be applied for expenditure for the purpose of contributing to achieving that outcome.

    * (2) If the portfolio statements indicate that activities of a particular kind were intended to be treated as activities in respect of a particular outcome, then expenditure for the purpose of carrying out those activities is taken to be expenditure for the purpose of contributing to achieving the outcome.

##### 9  Corporate entity items

    * (1) The amount specified in a corporate entity item for a corporate entity may be paid to the entity to be applied for the purposes of the entity.

    * (2) If:

     * (a) an Act provides that a corporate entity must be paid amounts that are appropriated by the Parliament for the purposes of the entity; and

     * (b) Schedule 1 contains a corporate entity item for that entity;

    * then the entity must be paid the full amount specified in the item.

### Part 3--Advance to the Finance Minister

##### 10  Advance to the Finance Minister

    * (1) If the Finance Minister determined an amount under subsection 10(2) of the _Appropriation Act (No. 1) 20142015_ before the commencement of this Act, the amount is to be disregarded for the purposes of subsection 10(3) of that Act.

      * Note: This means that, after the commencement of this Act, the Finance Minister has access to $295 million under section 10 of the _Appropriation Act (No. 1) 20142015_, regardless of amounts that have already been determined under that section.

    * (2) If:

     * (a) this Act appropriates an amount for particular expenditure; and

     * (b) before the commencement of this Act, the Finance Minister determined an amount (the **_advanced amount_**) under section 10 of the _Appropriation Act (No. 1) 20142015_ for the expenditure;

    * the amount appropriated by this Act for the expenditure is taken to be reduced (but not below nil) by the advanced amount.

### Part 4--Miscellaneous

##### 11  Crediting amounts to special accounts

    * If any of the purposes of a special account is a purpose that is covered by an item (whether or not the item expressly refers to the special account), then amounts may be debited against the appropriation for that item and credited to that special account.

##### 12  Appropriation of the Consolidated Revenue Fund

    * The Consolidated Revenue Fund is appropriated as necessary for the purposes of this Act, including the operation of this Act as affected by:

     * (a) the _Financial Management and Accountability Act 1997_, as that Act continues to apply because of Schedule 2 to the _Public Governance, Performance and Accountability (Consequential and Transitional Provisions) Act 2014_; and

     * (b) the _Public Governance, Performance and Accountability Act 2013_.

##### 13  Act ceases to be in force

    * This Act ceases to be in force at the start of 1 July 2017.

## Schedule 1--Services for which money is appropriated

  * Note: See sections 6 and 12.
