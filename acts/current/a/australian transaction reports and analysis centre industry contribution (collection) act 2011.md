    * **_AUSTRAC CEO _**has the same meaning as in the _AntiMoney Laundering and CounterTerrorism Financing Act 2006_.

    * **_business day_** means a day that is not a Saturday, a Sunday, a public holiday or a bank holiday in the place concerned.

    * **_late payment penalty_** means penalty payable under section 9.

    * **_leviable entity_**, in relation to a financial year, has the same meaning as in the _Australian Transaction Reports and Analysis Centre Industry Contribution Act 2011_.

    * **_levy_** means levy imposed by the _Australian Transaction Reports and Analysis Centre Industry Contribution Act 2011_.

    * **_levy month _**means one of the 12 months of the calendar year.

    * **_person _**has the same meaning as in the _AntiMoney Laundering and CounterTerrorism Financing Act 2006_.

    * (2) This Act applies to a partnership, unincorporated association or trust as if the partnership, unincorporated association or trust were a person, but with the following changes:

     * (a) an obligation that would otherwise be imposed on the partnership by this Act is imposed on each partner instead, but may be discharged by any of the partners;

     * (b) an obligation that would otherwise be imposed on the association by this Act is imposed on each member of the association's committee of management instead, but may be discharged by any of the members;

     * (c) an obligation that would otherwise be imposed on the trust by this Act is imposed on each trustee instead, but may be discharged by any of the trustees.

##### 7  Liability to pay levy

    * A person who is a leviable entity for a financial year is liable to pay levy, in one or more instalments, for that financial year.

##### 8  When instalment of levy due for payment

    * (1) An instalment of levy payable by a person for a financial year is due and payable on a business day that is:

     * (a) specified in a notice that the AUSTRAC CEO gives to the person in relation to the instalment; and

     * (b) not earlier than 30 days after the beginning of the financial year; and

     * (c) not earlier than 30 days after the day on which the notice is given.

    * (2) If the person nominates another person by written notice given to the AUSTRAC CEO:

     * (a) the notice under paragraph (1)(a) of this section may be given to the nominated person; and

     * (b) the obligation imposed on the person by subsection (1) of this section may be discharged by the nominated person.

    * (3) To avoid doubt, subsection (2) does not otherwise affect the person's liability under section 7.

##### 9  Late payment penalty

    * (1) If any instalment of levy payable by a person remains unpaid at the start of the levy month after the instalment became due for payment, the person is liable to pay the Commonwealth, for that levy month, a penalty worked out using the following formula:

    * (2) Late payment penalty for a levy month is due and payable at the end of the levy month.

    * (3) However, the AUSTRAC CEO may, by written notice given to the person before, on or after the day on which late payment penalty would be due and payable apart from this subsection, specify a later day as the day on which the late payment penalty is due and payable. The notice has effect, and is taken always to have had effect, according to its terms.

##### 10  Payment of levy and late payment penalty

    * An instalment of levy and late payment penalty are payable to the AUSTRAC CEO on behalf of the Commonwealth.

##### 11  Waiver of levy and late payment penalty

    * (1) The AUSTRAC CEO may, on behalf of the Commonwealth, if the AUSTRAC CEO considers it is appropriate to do so, waive the payment of the whole or a part of an amount of levy or late payment penalty (or both) that is payable by a person.

    * (2) The AUSTRAC CEO may do so on his or her own initiative or on written application by a person.

##### 12  Recovery of levy and late payment penalty

    * (1) The following amounts may be recovered by the Commonwealth from a person as debts due to the Commonwealth:

     * (a) an instalment of levy that is due and payable by the person;

     * (b) late payment penalty that is due and payable by the person.

    * (2) The AUSTRAC CEO is authorised, as agent of the Commonwealth, to bring proceedings in the name of the Commonwealth for the recovery of a debt due to the Commonwealth of a kind mentioned in subsection (1).

##### 13  Exempting laws ineffective

    * (1) Nothing in a law passed before the commencement of this section exempts a person from liability to pay levy.

    * (2) If a law (including a provision of a law) passed after the commencement of this section purports to exempt a person from:

     * (a) liability to pay taxes under laws of the Commonwealth; or

     * (b) liability to pay certain taxes under laws of the Commonwealth that would otherwise include levy;

    * the law does not operate to exempt the person from liability to pay levy unless the exemption expressly refers to levy under this Act.

    * (3) To avoid doubt, this section does not apply in relation to an exemption under this Act or the _Australian Transaction Reports and Analysis Centre Industry Contribution Act 2011_.

##### 14  Internal review of certain decisions

    * (1) A person who is affected by a decision of the AUSTRAC CEO under section 11 may, if dissatisfied with the decision, request the AUSTRAC CEO to reconsider the decision.

    * (2) The request must:

     * (a) be made by notice given to the AUSTRAC CEO within:

      * (i) the period of 21 days after the day on which the person first receives notice of the decision; or

      * (ii) any further period that the AUSTRAC CEO allows; and

     * (b) set out the reasons for making the request.

    * (3) After receiving the request, the AUSTRAC CEO must review the decision or cause the decision to be reviewed by a person:

     * (a) to whom the AUSTRAC CEO's power under this section is delegated; and

     * (b) who was not involved in the making of the decision; and

     * (c) who occupies a position in AUSTRAC that is senior to that occupied by a person involved in the making of the decision.

    * (4) Within 42 days after receiving the request, the person reviewing the decision must:

     * (a) reconsider the decision; and

     * (b) confirm, revoke or vary the decision, as the person thinks fit.

    * (5) If the person reviewing the decision does not confirm, revoke or vary the decision within the period of 42 days after receiving the request, he or she is taken to have confirmed the decision under subsection (4) immediately after the end of that period.

    * (6) The person reviewing the decision must give a notice in writing to the person that made the request that sets out the result of the reconsideration of the decision and gives the reasons for his or her decision.

##### 15  Administrative Appeals Tribunal review of certain decisions

    * Applications may be made to the Administrative Appeals Tribunal for review of: 

     * (a) a decision of the AUSTRAC CEO that has been confirmed or varied under subsection 14(4) or a decision that has been taken to have been confirmed under subsection 14(5); or

     * (b) a decision of the AUSTRAC CEO under subsection 14(4) to revoke a decision.

    * (3) The Minister must cause a copy of the report of the review to be tabled in each House of Parliament within 15 sitting days of receiving it.
