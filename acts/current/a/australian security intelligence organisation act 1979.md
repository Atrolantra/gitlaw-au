    * (6) If, before the DirectorGeneral seeks the Minister's consent to the request (the **_proposed request_**), the person has been detained under this Division in connection with one or more warrants (the **_earlier warrants_**) issued under this Division:

     * (a) the Minister must take account of those facts in deciding whether to consent; and

     * (b) the Minister may consent only if the Minister is satisfied that the issue of the warrant to be requested is justified by information that is additional to or materially different from that known to the DirectorGeneral at the time the DirectorGeneral sought the Minister's consent to request the issue of the last of the earlier warrants issued before the seeking of the Minister's consent to the proposed request.

    * (2) If the person has already been detained under this Division in connection with one or more warrants (the **_earlier warrants_**) issued under this Division:

     * (a) the issuing authority must take account of those facts in deciding whether to issue the warrant requested; and

     * (b) the issuing authority may issue the warrant requested only if the authority is satisfied that:

      * (i) the issue of that warrant is justified by information additional to or materially different from that known to the DirectorGeneral at the time the DirectorGeneral sought the Minister's consent to request the issue of the last of the earlier warrants issued before the seeking of the Minister's consent to the request for the issue of the warrant requested; and

      * (ii) the person is not being detained under this Division in connection with one of the earlier warrants.

    * This subsection has effect in addition to subsection (1).

    * What the warrant authorises

    * (3) The warrant must, in the same terms as the draft warrant given to the issuing authority as part of the request, do the following:

     * (c) the passage of 168 hours starting when the person was first brought before a prescribed authority under the warrant.

    * Contacting persons

    * (5) The warrant may identify someone whom the person is permitted to contact by reference to the fact that he or she is a lawyer of the person's choice or has a particular legal or familial relationship with the person. This does not limit the ways in which the warrant may identify persons whom the person is permitted to contact.

        * Note 1: The warrant may identify persons by reference to a class. See subsection 33(3AB) of the _Acts Interpretation Act 1901_.

        * Note 2: Section 34K permits the person to contact the InspectorGeneral of Intelligence and Security, the Ombudsman and a person referred to in paragraph 40SB(3)(b) of the _Australian Federal Police Act 1979_ while the person is in custody or detention, so the warrant must identify them.

        * Note 3: A warrant issued under this section must permit the person to contact a single lawyer of the person's choice, so the warrant must identify such a lawyer.

    * (6) The warrant may specify times when the person is permitted to contact someone identified as a lawyer of the person's choice by reference to the fact that the times are:

     * (a) while the person is in detention in connection with the warrant; and

    * Warrant must authorise certain actions by the Organisation

    * (7) Also, the warrant must, in the same terms as the draft warrant given to the issuing authority as part of the request:

     * (a) authorise the Organisation, subject to any restrictions or conditions, to question the person before a prescribed authority by requesting the person to do either or both of the following:

      * (i) give information that is or may be relevant to intelligence that is important in relation to a terrorism offence;

      * (ii) produce records or things that are or may be relevant to intelligence that is important in relation to a terrorism offence; and

     * (b) what the warrant authorises the Organisation to do;

     * (c) the effect of section 34L (including the fact that the section creates offences);

     * (d) the period for which the warrant is in force;

     * (e) the person's right to make a complaint orally or in writing:

      * (i) to the InspectorGeneral of Intelligence and Security under the _InspectorGeneral of Intelligence and Security Act 1986_ in relation to the Organisation; or

      * (ii) to the Ombudsman under the _Ombudsman Act 1976_ in relation to the Australian Federal Police;

      * (iii) to a complaints agency in relation to the police force or police service of the State or Territory concerned;

     * (ea) the person's right to give information orally or in writing, under Division 2 of Part V of the _Australian Federal Police Act 1979_, to a person referred to in subsection 40SA(1) of that Act in relation to the Australian Federal Police;

     * (f) the fact that the person may seek from a federal court a remedy relating to the warrant or the treatment of the person in connection with the warrant;

     * (g) whether there is any limit on the person contacting others and, if the warrant permits the person to contact identified persons at specified times when the person is in custody or detention authorised by the warrant, who the identified persons are and what the specified times are.

    * (2) To avoid doubt, subsection (1) does not apply to a prescribed authority if the person has previously appeared before another prescribed authority for questioning under the warrant.

    * (3) The prescribed authority before whom the person appears for questioning must inform the person of the role of the prescribed authority. In particular, the prescribed authority must inform the person that the role of the prescribed authority includes:

     * (a) supervising the questioning of the person; and

     * (b) giving appropriate directions under section 34K in relation to the person.

    * (4) The prescribed authority before whom the person appears for questioning must inform the person of the reason for the presence of each other person who is present at any time during the questioning. However:

     * (a) the prescribed authority must not name any person except with the consent of the person to be named; and

     * (b) the obligation to inform the person being questioned about a particular person's reason for presence need only be complied with once (even if that particular person subsequently returns to the questioning).

    * (5) At least once in every 24hour period during which questioning of the person under the warrant occurs, the prescribed authority before whom the person appears for questioning must inform the person of the fact that the person may seek from a federal court a remedy relating to the warrant or the treatment of the person in connection with the warrant.

        * Note: For example, the person may be able to apply to the Federal Court of Australia under subsection 39B(1) of the _Judiciary Act 1903_, or the High Court of Australia under paragraph 75(v) of the Constitution, for a remedy in relation to the warrant or the treatment of the person in connection with the warrant.

     * (a) is consistent with the warrant; or

     * (b) has been approved in writing by the Minister.

    * However, the prescribed authority may give a direction that is not covered by paragraph (a) or (b) if he or she has been informed under section 34Q of a concern of the InspectorGeneral of Intelligence and Security and is satisfied that giving the direction is necessary to address the concern satisfactorily.

    * (3) To avoid doubt, the mere fact that the warrant is issued under section 34E does not prevent a direction under subsection (1) of this section from being consistent with the warrant for the purposes of subsection (2) of this section.

        * Note: A warrant issued under section 34E requires a person to appear before a prescribed authority for questioning under the warrant (rather than authorising the person to be taken into custody, brought before a prescribed authority and detained).

    * (4) The prescribed authority is only to give a direction described in paragraph (1)(a) or (b) if he or she is satisfied that there are reasonable grounds for believing that, if the person is not detained, the person:

     * (b) may not continue to appear, or may not appear again, before a prescribed authority; or

     * (c) may destroy, damage or alter a record or thing the person has been requested, or may be requested, in accordance with the warrant, to produce.

    * (5) A direction under subsection (1) must not result in:

     * (a) a person being detained after the first time when either of the following events happens:

      * (i) someone exercising authority under the warrant informs the prescribed authority before whom the person is appearing for questioning that the Organisation does not have any further request described in paragraph 34E(4)(a) or 34G(7)(a) to make of the person;

      * (ii) section 34R prohibits anyone exercising authority under the warrant from questioning the person under the warrant; or

     * (b) a person's detention being arranged by a person who is not a police officer.

        * Note: Section 34S also provides that this Division does not authorise a person to be detained for a continuous period of more than 168 hours.

    * Giving effect to directions

    * (6) Directions given by a prescribed authority have effect, and may be implemented or enforced, according to their terms.

    * (7) A police officer may take a person into custody and bring him or her before a prescribed authority for questioning under a warrant issued under this Division if the person fails to appear before a prescribed authority as required by the warrant or a direction given by a prescribed authority under this section.

    * Direction has no effect on further warrant

      * (ii) to give oral or written information of the kind referred to in paragraph 34J(1)(ea); and

     * (c) the person requests facilities to make the complaint or give the information; and

     * (d) the prescribed authority gives a direction under subsection (1) deferring questioning of the person under the warrant;

    * then anyone exercising authority under the warrant must give the person facilities for making the complaint or giving the information.

    * Communications while in custody or detention

    * (10) A person who has been taken into custody, or detained, under this Division is not permitted to contact, and may be prevented from contacting, anyone at any time while in custody or detention.

    * (11) However:

     * (a) the person may contact anyone whom the warrant under which he or she is detained, or a direction described in paragraph (1)(d), permits the person to contact; and

     * (b) subsection (10) does not affect the operation of sections 10 and 13 of the _InspectorGeneral of Intelligence and Security Act 1986_ in relation to contact between the person and the InspectorGeneral of Intelligence and Security; and

     * (c) anyone holding the person in custody or detention under this Division must give the person facilities for contacting the InspectorGeneral of Intelligence and Security to make a complaint orally under section 10 of the _InspectorGeneral of Intelligence and Security Act 1986_ if the person requests them; and

     * (g) anyone holding the person in custody or detention under this Division must give the person facilities for contacting the Commissioner of the Australian Federal Police to give information orally under section 40SA of the _Australian Federal Police Act 1979_ if the person requests them; and

     * (h) subsection (10) does not affect the person's right to make a complaint to a complaints agency in relation to the police force or police service of the State or Territory concerned; and

     * (i) anyone holding the person in custody or detention under this Division must give the person facilities for contacting a complaints agency to make an oral or written complaint of the kind mentioned in paragraph (h) if the person requests them.

    * (1) To avoid doubt, a person before a prescribed authority for questioning under a warrant issued under this Division may be questioned under the warrant in the absence of a lawyer of the person's choice.

        * Note: As the warrant authorises questioning of the person only while the person is before a prescribed authority, the prescribed authority can control whether questioning occurs by controlling whether the person is present before the prescribed authority.

    * (2) This section does not permit questioning of the person by a person exercising authority under the warrant at a time when a person exercising authority under the warrant is required by another section of this Division not to question the person.

        * Example: This section does not permit the person to be questioned when a person exercising authority under the warrant is required by section 34M or section 34N to defer questioning because an interpreter is not present.

     * (a) to admit or exclude evidence in any proceedings; or

     * (b) to stay criminal proceedings in the interests of justice.

    * (2) In determining whether evidence should be admitted or excluded in any proceedings, the fact that the evidence was obtained as a result of a person engaging in criminal activity is to be disregarded if:

    * (4) As soon as practicable after making an application in accordance with paragraph (2)(b), the applicant must:

     * (a) make a written record of the application; and

    * (5) If a special intelligence operation authority is granted in accordance with paragraph (4)(b), a written record of the special intelligence operation authority that complies with section 35D must be issued within 7 days.

    * (1) If an authority to conduct a special intelligence operation is varied in a way that limits its scope, this Division continues to apply to a participant in the special intelligence operation as if the authority had not been varied in that way, for so long as the participant:

     * (a) is unaware of the variation; and

     * (b) is not reckless about the existence of the variation.
