##### 3  Definitions

    * In this Act: 

    * **_administered item_** means an amount set out in Schedule 1 opposite an outcome for an Agency under the heading "Administered".

    * **_Agency_** means:

     * (a) an Agency within the meaning of the _Financial Management and Accountability Act 1997_; or

     * (b) the High Court of Australia.

    * **_CAC Act body_** means:

     * (a) a Commonwealth authority within the meaning of the _Commonwealth Authorities and Companies Act 1997_; or

     * (b) a Commonwealth company within the meaning of the _Commonwealth Authorities and Companies Act 1997_.

    * **_CAC Act body payment item_** means the total amount set out in Schedule 1 in relation to a CAC Act body under the heading "Administered".

       * Note: The amounts set out opposite outcomes for CAC Act bodies, under the heading "Administered", are "notional". They are not part of the item, and do not in any way restrict the scope of the expenditure authorised by the item.

    * **_Chief Executive_** has the same meaning as in the _Financial Management and Accountability Act 1997_.

    * **_current year_** means the financial year ending on 30 June 2014.

    * **_departmental item_** means the total amount set out in Schedule 1 in relation to an Agency under the heading "Departmental".

       * Note: The amounts set out opposite outcomes, under the heading "Departmental", are "notional". They are not part of the item, and do not in any way restrict the scope of the expenditure authorised by the item.

    * **_expenditure_** means payments for expenses, acquiring assets, making loans or paying liabilities.

    * **_Finance Minister_** means the Minister administering this Act.

    * **_item_** means an administered item, a CAC Act body payment item or a departmental item.

    * **_Portfolio Additional Estimates Statements_** means the Portfolio Additional Estimates Statements that were tabled in the Senate or the House of Representatives in relation to the Bill for the _Appropriation Act (No. 3) 20132014_ and the Bill for the _Appropriation Act (No. 4) 20132014_.

    * **_Portfolio Budget Statements_** means the Portfolio Budget Statements that were tabled in the Senate or the House of Representatives in relation to the Bill for the _Appropriation Act (No. 1) 20132014 _and the Bill for the _Appropriation Act (No. 2) 20132014_.

    * **_Portfolio Statements_** means:

     * (a) the Portfolio Budget Statements; and

     * (b) the Portfolio Additional Estimates Statements; and

     * (c) the Portfolio Supplementary Additional Estimates Statements.

    * **_Portfolio Supplementary Additional Estimates Statements_** means the Portfolio Supplementary Additional Estimates Statements that were tabled in the Senate or the House of Representatives in relation to the Bill for this Act and the Bill for the _Appropriation Act (No. 6) 20132014_.

##### 4  Portfolio Statements

    * The Portfolio Statements are hereby declared to be relevant documents for the purposes of section 15AB of the _Acts Interpretation Act 1901_.

       * Note: See paragraph 15AB(2)(g) of the _Acts Interpretation Act 1901_ which provides that the material that may be considered in the interpretation of a provision of an Act includes any document that is declared by the Act to be a relevant document.

##### 5  Notional payments, receipts etc.

    * For the purposes of this Act, notional transactions between Agencies are to be treated as if they were real transactions.

       * Note: This section applies, for example, to a "payment" between Agencies that are both part of the Commonwealth. One of the effects of this section is that the payment will be debited from an appropriation for the paying Agency, even though no payment is actually made from the Consolidated Revenue Fund. This is consistent with section 6 of the _Financial Management and Accountability Act 1997_.

### Part 2--Appropriation items

##### 6  Summary of appropriations

    * The total of the items specified in Schedule 1 is $337,434,000.

       * Note 1: Items in Schedule 1 can be adjusted under Part 3 of this Act.

       * Note 2: Sections 30 to 32 of the _Financial Management and Accountability Act 1997_ also provide for adjustments of amounts appropriated by this Act.

##### 7  Departmental items

    * The amount specified in a departmental item for an Agency may be applied for the departmental expenditure of the Agency.

##### 8  Administered items

    * (1) The amount specified in an administered item for an outcome for an Agency may be applied for expenditure for the purpose of contributing to achieving that outcome.

    * (2) If the Portfolio Statements indicate that activities of a particular kind were intended to be treated as activities in respect of a particular outcome, then expenditure for the purpose of carrying out those activities is taken to be expenditure for the purpose of contributing to achieving the outcome.

##### 9  CAC Act body payment items

    * (1) The amount specified in a CAC Act body payment item for a CAC Act body may be paid to the body to be applied for the purposes of the body.

##### 11  Reducing administered items

     * (b) if the report does not specify the required amount--determine an amount that is taken to be the required amount for the purposes of subsection (1).

    * (3) A determination made under subsection (2) is a legislative instrument and, despite subsection 44(2) of the _Legislative Instruments Act 2003_, section 42 (disallowance) of that Act applies to the determination. However, Part 6 (sunsetting) of that Act does not apply to the determination.

##### 12  Reducing CAC Act body payment items

    * (1) A written request to reduce a CAC Act body payment item for a CAC Act body may be made to the Finance Minister by:

     * (a) the Prime Minister or a Minister acting on behalf of the Prime Minister; or

     * (b) the Minister who is responsible for the body; or

    * (5) Despite subsection 33(3) of the _Acts Interpretation Act 1901_, the determination must not be rescinded, revoked, amended or varied, other than to correct an error.

    * (8) A determination made under subsection (2) is a legislative instrument and, despite subsection 44(2) of the _Legislative Instruments Act 2003_, section 42 (disallowance) of that Act applies to the determination. However, Part 6 (sunsetting) of that Act does not apply to the determination.

##### 13  Advance to the Finance Minister

       * Note: This means that, after the commencement of this Act, the Finance Minister has access to $295 million under section 13 of the _Appropriation Act (No. 1) 20132014_, regardless of amounts that have already been determined under that section.

    * (2) If:
