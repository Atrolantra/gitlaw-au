   * 2**  Commencement **[_see_ Note 1]

   * (1) This Act commences on the commencement of the _Australian Prudential Regulation Authority Act 1998_.

##### 3  Act binds the Crown

   * This Act binds the Crown in each of its capacities.

##### 4  External Territories

   * This Act extends to each external Territory.

##### 5  Definitions

   * In this Act, unless the contrary intention appears:

   * **_authorised NOHC_** means:

    * (a) an authorised NOHC within the meaning of the _Banking Act 1959_ or the _Insurance Act 1973_; or

    * (b) a registered NOHC within the meaning of the _Life Insurance Act 1995_.

     * Note: NOHC is short for non-operating holding company.

   * **_indexation factor_** means the indexation factor calculated under section 8.

   * **_index number_**, in relation to a quarter, means the All Groups Consumer Price Index number, being the weighted average of the 8 capital cities, published by the Australian Statistician in respect of that quarter.

   * **_levy imposition day_**, in relation to an authorised NOHC for a financial year, means:

    * (a) if the authorised NOHC is an authorised NOHC on 1 July of the financial year--that day; or

    * (b) in any other case--the day, during the financial year, on which the authorised NOHC becomes an authorised NOHC.

   * **_statutory upper limit_** means:

    * (a) in relation to the financial year commencing on 1 July 2005--$1,500,000; or

    * (b) in relation to a later financial year--the amount calculated by multiplying the statutory upper limit for the previous financial year by the indexation factor for the later financial year.

##### 6  Imposition of authorised non-operating holding companies supervisory levy

   * Levy payable in accordance with subsection 8(2) of the _Financial Institutions Supervisory Levies Collection Act 1998_ is imposed.

##### 7  Amount of levy

   * (1) Subject to subsection (2), the amount of levy payable by an authorised NOHC for a financial year is:

    * (a) if the authorised NOHC is an authorised NOHC within the meaning of the _Banking Act 1959_--the amount determined, by legislative instrument, by the Treasurer for the purpose of this paragraph in relation to the financial year; or

    * (b) if the authorised NOHC is an authorised NOHC within the meaning of the _Insurance Act 1973_--the amount determined, by legislative instrument, by the Treasurer for the purpose of this paragraph in relation to the financial year; or

    * (c) if the authorised NOHC is a registered NOHC within the meaning of the _Life Insurance Act 1995_--the amount determined, by legislative instrument, by the Treasurer for the purpose of this paragraph in relation to the financial year.

   * The amount determined under paragraph (a), (b) or (c) must not exceed the statutory upper limit as at the time when the determination is made.

   * (2) If the levy imposition day for the authorised NOHC for the financial year is later than 1 July in the financial year, the amount of levy payable by the authorised NOHC for the financial year is the amount worked out using the following formula:

##### 8  Calculation of indexation factor

   * (1) The indexation factor for a financial year is the number worked out by:

    * (a) dividing the index number for the March quarter immediately preceding that financial year by the index number for the March quarter immediately preceding that first-mentioned March quarter; and

    * (b) adding 0.030 to the number worked out under paragraph (a).

   * (2) The indexation factor is to be calculated to 3 decimal places, but increased by .001 if the 4th decimal place is more than 4.

   * (3) Calculations under paragraph (1)(a):

    * (a) are to be made using only the index numbers published in terms of the most recently published reference base for the Consumer Price Index; and

    * (b) are to be made disregarding index numbers that are published in substitution for previously published index numbers (except where the substituted numbers are published to take account of changes in the reference base).

##### 9  Regulations

   * The Governor-General may make regulations for the purposes of subsection 2(2).
