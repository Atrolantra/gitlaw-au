### An Act to implement A New Tax System by establishing a Register of Australian Business and providing for the issue of Australian Business Numbers, and for related purposes

### Part 1--Preliminary

##### 1  Short title 

    * This Act may be cited as the _A New Tax System (Australian Business Number) Act 1999_.

##### 2  Commencement 

    * This Act commences on the day on which it receives the Royal Assent.

#### Division 2--Objects

##### 3  Objects

    * Main object

    * (1) The main object of this Act is to make it easier for businesses to conduct their dealings with the Australian Government. This is done by establishing a system for registering businesses and issuing them with unique identifying numbers so that they can identify themselves reliably:

     * (a) in all their dealings with the Australian Government; and

     * (b) for all other Commonwealth purposes.

    * (2) Without limiting paragraph (1)(b), the main object of this Act includes allowing businesses to identify themselves reliably for the purposes of *taxation laws.

    * Reducing registration and reporting requirements

    * (3) The objects of this Act also include reducing the number of government registration and reporting requirements by making the system available to State, Territory and local government regulatory bodies.

       * Note: Section 30 facilitates this object by enabling the Registrar to provide information collected under this Act to State, Territory and local government bodies.

    * Multiagency dealings

    * (4) The objects of this Act also include allowing the *Registrar to register and maintain details about representatives of *businesses that are registered under this Act, for the purpose of facilitating electronic dealings by those businesses with *government entities.

#### Division 3--Application of this Act

##### 4  Crown bound by this Act

    * This Act binds the Crown in each of its capacities, but does not make the Crown liable to be prosecuted for an offence.

##### 5  Application to government entities, nonprofit subentities, superannuation funds and certain RSE licensees

    * (1) This Act applies to a *government entity, a *nonprofit subentity or a *superannuation fund as if it were an *entity *carrying on an *enterprise in *Australia.

    * (2) This Act applies to an *RSE licensee, or an applicant for an *RSE licence, that is a group of individual trustees as if the group were an *entity *carrying on an *enterprise in *Australia.

     * (a) does an activity, or a series of activities:

      * (i) in pursuit of his or her vocation as a religious practitioner; and

      * (ii) as a member of a religious institution; and

     * (b) does not do the activity, or series of activities, as an employee or agent of the religious institution or another entity;

    * this Act applies as if the activity, or series of activities, had been done by the religious institution and not by the religious practitioner.

       * Note: This will mean that such an activity will be an enterprise of the religious institution and not an enterprise of the religious practitioner.

##### 6  Application of Criminal Code

    * The _Criminal Code_ applies to all offences against this Act.

##### 7  Application to the external Territories

    * This Act extends to every external Territory.
