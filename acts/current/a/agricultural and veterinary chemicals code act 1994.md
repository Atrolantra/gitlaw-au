### Part 7--Permits

##### 108  Explanation of Part

    * (1) This Part sets up a system under which a person who wants to do something in respect of an active constituent for a proposed or existing chemical product, or in respect of a chemical product, that would otherwise be prohibited by this Code or another law of this jurisdiction may obtain a permit in respect of the doing of the thing.

    * (2) Examples of circumstances in which a permit could be sought are:

     * (a) if someone wants to conduct a trial or experiment in relation to a constituent that is not an approved constituent, or in relation to a chemical product that is not a registered chemical product or a reserved chemical product, in order to decide whether to make an application for approval or registration; or

##### 109  Definition of permit

    * In this Part: 

    * **_permit_** means a permit, in respect of an active constituent for a proposed or existing chemical product, or in respect of a chemical product, to do or omit to do any thing stated in the permit the doing of which, or the omission to do which, would, apart from the permit, be:

     * (a) an offence against section 74, 75, 76, 77, 78, 79, 79B, 80, 81, 84, 85, 86, 87 or 91 or subsection 121(4A) or (5A); or

    * (2) The APVMA must make the application within 6 years of the alleged contravention.

    * Court may order person to pay pecuniary penalty

    * (3) If the court is satisfied that the person has contravened the civil penalty provision, the court may order the person to pay to the Commonwealth such pecuniary penalty for the contravention as the court determines to be appropriate.

        * Note: Section 145AA sets out the maximum penalty that the court may order the person to pay.

    * (4) An order under subsection (3) is a **_civil penalty order_**.

    * Determining pecuniary penalty

    * (5) In determining the pecuniary penalty, the court may take into account all relevant matters, including:

    * (1) The pecuniary penalty for a contravention of a civil penalty provision by a body corporate must not exceed 5 times the amount of the maximum monetary penalty that could be imposed by a court if the body corporate were convicted of an offence constituted by conduct that is the same as the conduct constituting the contravention.

    * Penalty for individuals

    * (2) The pecuniary penalty for a contravention of a civil penalty provision by an individual must not exceed 3 times the amount of the maximum monetary penalty that could be imposed by a court if the person were convicted of an offence constituted by conduct that is the same as the conduct constituting the contravention.

##### 145AB  Civil enforcement of penalty

    * (1) A pecuniary penalty is a debt payable to the Commonwealth.

##### 145AC  Conduct contravening more than one civil penalty provision

##### 145AD  Multiple contraventions

    * (1) A court may make a single civil penalty order against a person for multiple contraventions of a civil penalty provision if proceedings for the contraventions are founded on the same facts, or if the contraventions form, or are part of, a series of contraventions of the same or a similar character.

        * Note: For continuing contraventions of civil penalty provisions, see section 145C.

##### 145BB  Criminal proceedings after civil proceedings

##### 145CB  Mistake of fact

    * (1) A person is not liable to have a civil penalty order made against the person for a contravention of a civil penalty provision if:

      * (i) considered whether or not facts existed; and

      * (ii) was under a mistaken but reasonable belief about those facts; and

     * (b) had those facts existed, the conduct would not have constituted a contravention of the civil penalty provision.

    * (3) Subsection (1) does not affect the operation of section 145CB (which is about mistake of fact).

    * (4) Subsection (1) does not apply to the extent that the civil penalty provision, or a provision that relates to the civil penalty provision, expressly provides otherwise.

##### 145CD  Evidential burden for exceptions

    * In proceedings for a civil penalty order, a person who wishes to rely on any exception, excuse, qualification or justification in relation to a civil penalty provision bears an evidential burden in relation to that matter.

    * (1) For the purposes of section 145CF, in determining whether an executive officer of a body corporate failed to take all reasonable steps to prevent the contravention of a civil penalty provision, a court is to have regard to:

     * (a) what action (if any) the officer took towards ensuring that the body's employees, agents and contractors have a reasonable knowledge and understanding of the requirements to comply with this Code, in so far as those requirements affect the employees, agents or contractors concerned; and

     * (b) what action (if any) the officer took when he or she became aware that the body was contravening this Code.
