     * (a) the quality, standard or grade of goods;

     * (b) the period during which the goods are to be exported;

     * (c) the way in which a restriction on export is to apply to goods (for example, the rate of tariff or other similar charge that is to apply to goods).

##### 4  Object of this Act

    * The object of this Act is to enable the Secretary to establish systems of quotas to protect the orderly export of goods: 

     * (a) where restrictions on exports of meat or particular classes of meat to particular countries are imposed, or in the opinion of the Secretary will be imposed, either by Australia or the countries concerned; or

     * (b) where, in relation to live sheep and lambs, the Secretary otherwise considers it in the best interests of the industry to do so.

##### 5  Limitation on exports

    * (1) The Secretary may, by notices in writing given to licensees, impose a limitation on the total quantity of goods, or a specified class of goods, that may be exported to a specified country.

    * (2) A licensee who has been given a notice under subsection (1) must not export goods, or goods of the class specified in the notice, as the case may be, to the country referred to in the notice, except in accordance with a quota held by the licensee.

##### 6  Quotas

    * (1) Where a limitation has been, or is to be, imposed under section 5 in relation to particular exports, the Secretary may grant:

     * (a) a single quota authorising the holder to make all those exports; or

     * (b) 2 or more quotas authorising each of the holders to make a specified proportion of those exports.

##### (2) The Secretary may grant a quota:

##### (a) by allocating it to a licensee on application by the licensee and on payment of the prescribed fee; or

     * (b) by selling it to a licensee by auction, sale by tender or private sale.

    * (3) A quota has effect for the period, not exceeding 2 years, specified in the quota document, but this subsection does not prevent the grant of other quotas.

     * (a) to sell or allocate a quota of a particular amount or kind; or
