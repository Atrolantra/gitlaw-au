    * This Act also creates an Advisory Group, the AntiDoping Rule Violation Panel (known as the ADRVP) and the Australian Sports Drug Medical Advisory Committee (known as the ASDMAC).

    * The Advisory Group provides advice and recommendations to the CEO.

    * The ADRVP has various functions, including those conferred on the ADRVP by the NAD scheme (see section 41). The NAD scheme must authorise the ADRVP to make assertions relating to investigations of possible violations of the antidoping rules, and require the ADRVP to notify the CEO of such assertions.

    * The ASDMAC has various functions, including those conferred on the ASDMAC by the NAD scheme (see section 52).
