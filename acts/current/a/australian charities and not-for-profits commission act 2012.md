### An Act to establish the Australian Charities and Notforprofits Commission and a national regulatory framework for the notforprofit sector, and for related purposes

#### Preamble

     * The Parliament of Australia recognises the unique nature and diversity of notforprofit entities and the distinctive role that they play in Australia.

     * Notforprofit entities promote a broad range of community, altruistic and philanthropic purposes. The notforprofit sector delivers vital services and benefits to communities throughout Australia.

     * The notforprofit sector receives a range of funding, including donations from members of the public and tax concessions, grants and other support from Australian governments.

     * It is important that a national regulatory system that promotes good governance, accountability and transparency for notforprofit entities be introduced to maintain, protect and enhance public trust and confidence in the notforprofit sector.

     * It is therefore necessary to establish a Commissioner of the Australian Charities and Notforprofits Commission who will focus on the notforprofit sector and will recognise and respond to the diversity and uniqueness of the sector.

     * The Parliament of Australia enacts:

#### Division 20--Object of this Part

##### 205  Object of this Part

     * Tax concessions

     * (1) This Part provides for the Commissioner to register entities as particular types and subtypes of notforprofit entities. It also provides for the Commissioner to revoke the registration of registered entities.

     * (2) Such registration is a prerequisite for an entity to access certain Commonwealth tax concessions. The object of this Part is to ensure that these tax concessions are available only to entities that are governed and regulated in accordance with this Act.

     * Other concessions

     * (3) Registration under this Act may also be a prerequisite for other exemptions, benefits and concessions provided under other Australian laws.

#### Division 25--Entitlement to registration

##### 251  Simplified outline

     * The following is a simplified outline of this Division: 

     * A notforprofit entity is entitled to registration under this Act as a type of entity if certain conditions are satisfied.

     * A notforprofit entity is entitled to registration under this Act as a subtype of entity if certain conditions are satisfied (including that the entity is registered as a type of entity).

##### 255  Entitlement to registration

     * (1) An entity is entitled to registration as a type of entity if:

      * (a) it meets the conditions in subsection (3); and

      * (b) it meets the description of that type of entity in column 1 of the table in subsection (5); and

      * (c) if the entity has previously been a registered entity, but its registration as a type of entity has been revoked--the Commissioner is satisfied that the matters which led to the revocation have been dealt with such that the registration of the entity would not conflict with the objects of this Act.

          * Note: Registration of an entity mentioned in paragraph (c) has effect from the time of registration (see section 3030). It does not rescind the revocation of the previous registration.

     * (2) An entity is entitled to registration as a subtype of entity if:

      * (a) it meets the conditions in subsection (3); and

      * (b) it meets the description of that subtype of entity in column 2 of the table in subsection (5); and

      * (c) it is entitled to registration as the type of entity that corresponds to that subtype of entity (as set out in that table); and

      * (d) it is registered as that type of entity.

     * (3) The conditions are as follows:

      * (a) the entity is a notforprofit entity;

      * (b) the entity is in compliance with the governance standards and external conduct standards (see Part 31);

      * (c) the entity has an ABN;

      * (d) the entity is not covered by a decision in writing made by an Australian government agency (including a judicial officer) under an Australian law that provides for entities to be characterised on the basis of them engaging in, or supporting, terrorist or other criminal activities.

     * (4) To avoid doubt, an entity may be entitled to registration as more than one subtype of entity.

         * Note: An entity could be registered as an entity with a purpose of advancing social or public welfare, and also be registered as a public benevolent institution.

     * (5) The table is as follows:

         * Note 1: For the definition of **_charity_**, see the _Charities Act 2013_.

         * Note 2: An entity commonly known as a health promotion charity could be an entity described in column 2 of item 13 of the table (institution whose principal activity is to promote the prevention or the control of diseases in human beings).

     * Trusts

     * (6) Section 18 of the _Charities Act 2013_ (Cy pres and similar schemes) applies:

      * (a) for the purposes of this Act; or

      * (b) for the purposes of determining whether an entity meets the description of a type or subtype of entity in the table in subsection (5) of this section;

     * in the same way as that section 18 applies for the purposes of that Act.

     * Treating application as being refused

     * (2) After the time worked out under subsection (3), the applicant may give the Commissioner, in the approved form, written notice that the applicant wishes to treat the application as having been refused, if the Commissioner has not given the applicant before that time written notice that the Commissioner has registered or has refused to register the applicant.

      * (a) registration as a type of entity;

      * (b) registration as a subtype of entity.

     * (1) The Commissioner may revoke the registration of a registered entity if the Commissioner reasonably believes that any of the following conditions are met:

      * (a) at any time after the date of effect of the registration, the entity is or was not entitled to registration;

      * (b) the registered entity provided, in connection with its application for registration, information that was false or misleading in a material particular;

      * (b) what action the Commissioner, the registered entity, or any of the responsible entities of the registered entity, could take or have taken:

       * (i) to address any such contravention or noncompliance (or prevent any such contravention or noncompliance that is more likely than not); or

       * (ii) to prevent any similar contravention or noncompliance;

      * (c) the desirability of ensuring that contributions (see section 20540) to the registered entity are applied consistently with the notforprofit nature, and the purpose, of the registered entity;

      * (d) the objects of any Commonwealth laws that refer to registration under this Act;

      * (e) the extent (if any) to which the registered entity is conducting its affairs in a way that may cause harm to, or jeopardise, the public trust and confidence in the notforprofit sector mentioned in subsection 155(1) (Objects of this Act);

      * (f) the welfare of members of the community (if any) that receive direct benefits from the registered entity;

      * (g) any other matter that the Commissioner considers relevant.

       * (i) the day on which the entity first ceased to be entitled; or

       * (ii) a later day; or

      * (b) if the reason for the revocation is that the entity provided, in connection with its application for registration, information that was false or misleading in a material particular:

       * (i) the day on which the registration took effect; or

       * (ii) a later day; or

      * (c) otherwise:

       * (i) the day on which the revocation is made; or

       * (ii) a later day.

     * (4) The Commissioner must give the entity written notice within 14 days if the Commissioner revokes its registration.

##### 3515  Notice to registered entity to show cause

      * (b) invite the registered entity to give the Commissioner, within 28 days after the day the notice is given, a written statement showing cause why the Commissioner should not revoke the registration.

     * (3) This section does not apply if the Commissioner believes, on reasonable grounds and taking into account the matters mentioned in subsection 3510(2), that it would be appropriate for the Commissioner to revoke the registration without giving a show cause notice to the registered entity.

##### 3520  Review of revocation of registration

     * If the entity is dissatisfied with the revocation of its registration or a decision by the Commissioner to not revoke the entity's registration, the entity may object against the revocation or decision in the manner set out in Part 72.

## Chapter 3--Responsibilities of registered entities

### Part 31--Governance standards and external conduct standards

#### Division 45--Governance standards

##### 451  Simplified outline

     * The following is a simplified outline of this Division: 

     * This Division sets up a system to allow the creation of minimum governance standards that entities are required to meet (in order to become registered, and on an ongoing basis). These governance standards are to be set out in the regulations.

     * Compliance with the governance standards is a condition of entitlement to registration under paragraph 255(3)(b).

     * The object of the system setting up the standards is to provide a minimum level of confidence that registered entities will promote the effective and efficient use of their resources, will meet community expectations about managing their affairs and the use of public money, volunteer time and donations, and will minimise the risk of mismanagement and misappropriation.

##### 455  Object of this Division

     * (1) The object of this Division is to promote the objects of this Act by giving the public (including donors, members and volunteers of registered entities) confidence that registered entities:

      * (a) manage their affairs openly, accountably and transparently; and

      * (b) use their resources (including contributions and donations) effectively and efficiently; and

      * (c) minimise the risk of mismanagement and misappropriation; and

      * (d) pursue their purposes.

         * Note: The objects of this Act include supporting and sustaining a robust, vibrant, independent and innovative Australian notforprofit sector (see subsection 155(1)).

     * (2) This Division achieves that object by setting up a system to allow the regulations to specify standards with which an entity must comply in order to become registered under this Act, and to remain entitled to be registered under this Act.

         * Note 1: The main consequence of failure to comply with these standards is a loss of the entity's entitlement to registration. If the entity is a federally regulated entity, such a failure to comply may also result in enforcement action under Chapter 4.

         * Note 2: For the consequences of registration, see section 205.

         * Note 3: A registered entity must notify the Commissioner of significant noncompliance with these standards that results in the entity no longer being entitled to be registered (see section 655).

##### 4510  Regulations establishing governance standards

     * (1) The regulations may specify standards (the **_governance standards_**) with which an entity must comply in order to become registered under this Act, and to remain entitled to be registered under this Act.

     * (2) Without limiting the scope of subsection (1), those standards may:

      * (a) require the entity to ensure that its governing rules provide for a specified matter; or

      * (b) require the entity to achieve specified outcomes and:

       * (i) not specify how the entity is to achieve those outcomes; or

       * (ii) specify principles as to how the entity is to achieve those outcomes; or

      * (c) require the entity to establish and maintain processes for the purpose of ensuring specified matters.

     * (2A) Without limiting subparagraph (2)(b)(ii), the principles mentioned in that subparagraph may reflect the size of the entity, the amount and nature of contributions to the entity and the nature of the activities undertaken by the entity in pursuit of its purposes.

     * (3) Without limiting the scope of subsection (1), those standards may provide that specified requirements do not apply to specified kinds of entity.

     * (4) Without limiting the scope of subsection (1), those standards may provide that different requirements apply to different kinds of entity.

     * Basic religious charities

     * (5) The regulations must not require a registered entity to do, or not to do, a thing (including the things mentioned in subsection (2)) if the registered entity is a basic religious charity.

     * Political advocacy

     * (6) The regulations must not require an entity not to comment on, or advocate support for, a change to any matter established by law, policy or practice in the Commonwealth, a State, a Territory or another country, if:

      * (a) the comment or advocacy furthers, or is in aid of, the purpose of the entity; and

      * (b) the comment or advocacy is lawful.

##### 4515  Consultation

     * (1) Before the GovernorGeneral makes a regulation for the purposes of subsection 4510(1), the Minister must be satisfied that:

      * (a) appropriate consultation has been undertaken with:

       * (i) the notforprofit sector (such as through entities that represent parts of the sector); and

       * (ii) entities having expertise in fields relevant to the proposed regulation; and

       * (iii) entities likely to be affected by the proposed regulation; and

       * (iv) the Commissioner; and

      * (b) relevant input received as part of that consultation has been taken into account adequately.

     * (2) Without limiting, by implication, the form that consultation mentioned in paragraph (1)(a) might take, consultation to which all of the following paragraphs apply is appropriate consultation:

      * (a) the consultation involves consultation with the public;

      * (b) the consultation involves:

       * (i) notifying, directly and by advertisement, the entities mentioned in paragraph (1)(a) of the consultation; and

       * (ii) inviting them to make submissions by a specified date and, where necessary, to participate in public hearings to be held concerning the proposed regulation;

      * (c) the consultation is facilitated by the Commissioner.

     * (3) The fact that consultation does not occur, or that input is not taken into account, does not affect the validity or enforceability of the regulation.

     * (4) Part 3 of the _Legislative Instruments Act 2003_ does not apply to a regulation proposed to be made for the purposes of subsection 4510(1) of this Act.

##### 4520  Parliamentary scrutiny of standards

     * Despite subsection 12(1) of the _Legislative Instruments Act 2003_, a provision of a regulation made for the purposes of subsection 4510(1) of this Act does not commence until the day after the earlier of:

      * (a) if both Houses of the Parliament pass a resolution approving the provision--the day the resolution is passed by the second House to do so; and

      * (b) the last day on which the regulation could be disallowed in either House, unless:

       * (i) the regulation is disallowed; or

       * (ii) either House passes a resolution disapproving the provision;

      * on or before that day.

#### Division 50--External conduct standards

##### 501  Simplified outline

     * The following is a simplified outline of this Division: 

     * This Division sets up a system to allow the creation of minimum external conduct standards that entities are required to meet (in order to become registered, and on an ongoing basis). These external conduct standards are to be set out in the regulations and must deal only with:

         * (a) matters external to Australia; or

         * (b) matters not external to Australia but that are closely related to, or have or will have a significant impact on, entities, things or matters external to Australia.

     * Compliance with the external conduct standards is a condition of entitlement to registration under paragraph 255(3)(b).

##### 505  Object of this Division

     * (1) The object of this Division is to give the public (including donors, members and volunteers of registered entities) confidence that:

      * (a) funds sent outside Australia by registered entities:

       * (i) are reaching legitimate beneficiaries; and

       * (ii) are being used for legitimate purposes; and

       * (iii) are not contributing to terrorist, or other criminal, activities; and

      * (b) activities engaged in outside Australia by registered entities are not contributing to terrorist, or other criminal, activities.

     * (2) This Division achieves that object by setting up a system to allow the regulations to specify standards:

      * (a) with which an entity must comply in order to become registered under this Act, and to remain entitled to be registered under this Act; and

      * (b) regulating funds sent outside Australia by registered entities, and activities engaged in outside Australia by registered entities.

         * Note 1: The main consequence of failure to comply with these standards is a loss of the entity's entitlement to registration. Such a failure to comply may also result in enforcement action under Chapter 4.

         * Note 2: For the consequences of registration, see section 205.

         * Note 3: A registered entity must notify the Commissioner of significant noncompliance with these standards that results in the entity no longer being entitled to be registered (see section 655).

##### 5010  External conduct standards

     * (1) The regulations may specify standards (the **_external conduct standards_**) with which an entity must comply in order to become registered under this Act, and to remain entitled to be registered under this Act.

     * (2) Without limiting the scope of subsection (1), those standards may:

      * (a) require the entity to ensure that its governing rules provide for a specified matter; or

      * (b) require the entity to achieve specified outcomes and:

       * (i) not specify how the entity is to achieve those outcomes; or

       * (ii) specify principles as to how the entity is to achieve those outcomes; or

      * (c) require the entity to establish and maintain processes for the purpose of ensuring specified matters.

     * (2A) Without limiting subparagraph (2)(b)(ii), the principles mentioned in that subparagraph may reflect the size of the entity, the amount and nature of contributions to the entity and the nature of the activities undertaken by the entity in pursuit of its purposes.

     * (3) However, the external conduct standards must deal only with:

      * (a) matters external to Australia; or

      * (b) matters not external to Australia but that are closely related to, or have or will have a significant impact on, entities, things or matters external to Australia.

##### 5015  Consultation

     * (1) Before the GovernorGeneral makes a regulation for the purposes of subsection 5010(1), the Minister must be satisfied that:

      * (a) appropriate consultation has been undertaken with:

       * (i) the notforprofit sector (such as through entities that represent parts of the sector); and

       * (ii) entities having expertise in fields relevant to the proposed regulation; and

       * (iii) entities likely to be affected by the proposed regulation; and

       * (iv) the Commissioner; and

      * (b) relevant input received as part of that consultation has been taken into account adequately.

     * (2) Without limiting, by implication, the form that consultation mentioned in paragraph (1)(a) might take, consultation to which all of the following paragraphs apply is appropriate consultation:

      * (a) the consultation involves consultation with the public;

      * (b) the consultation involves:

       * (i) notifying, directly and by advertisement, the entities mentioned in paragraph (1)(a) of the consultation; and

       * (ii) inviting them to make submissions by a specified date and, where necessary, to participate in public hearings to be held concerning the proposed regulation;

      * (c) the consultation is facilitated by the Commissioner.

     * (3) The fact that consultation does not occur, or that input is not taken into account, does not affect the validity or enforceability of the regulation.

     * (4) Part 3 of the _Legislative Instruments Act 2003_ does not apply to a regulation proposed to be made for the purposes of subsection 5010(1) of this Act.

##### 5020  Parliamentary scrutiny of standards

     * Despite subsection 12(1) of the _Legislative Instruments Act 2003_, a provision of a regulation made for the purposes of subsection 5010(1) of this Act does not commence until the day after the earlier of:

      * (a) if both Houses of the Parliament pass a resolution approving the provision--the day the resolution is passed by the second House to do so; and

      * (b) the last day on which the regulation could be disallowed in either House, unless:

       * (i) the regulation is disallowed; or

       * (ii) either House passes a resolution disapproving the provision;

      * on or before that day.

     * so as to enable any recognised assessment activity to be carried out in relation to the entity.

     * (2) A registered entity must also keep written records that correctly record its operations, so as to enable any recognised assessment activity to be carried out in relation to the entity.

     * (3) The records must be:

     * Offence

     * (6) A registered entity commits an offence if the entity does not comply with this section.

       * Penalty: 20 penalty units.

     * (7) An offence against subsection (6) is an offence of strict liability.

         * Note: For strict liability, see section 6.1 of the _Criminal Code_.

##### 5510  Recognised assessment activity

     * A **_recognised assessment activity_**, in relation to a registered entity, is:

      * (a) an activity carried out by the Commissioner involving assessment of the entity's entitlement to registration as a type or subtype of entity; or

      * (b) an activity carried out by the Commissioner involving assessment of the entity's compliance with this Act and the regulations; or

      * (c) an activity carried out by the Commissioner of Taxation involving assessment of the entity's compliance with any taxation law.

#### Division 60--Reporting

##### Subdivision 60A--Overview

##### 601  Simplified outline

     * This Division sets out the reporting obligations for registered entities based upon the entity's size and determined according to whether the entity is a small, medium or large registered entity.

     * All registered entities must provide the Commissioner with an annual information statement.

     * Medium and large entities must also provide the Commissioner with a financial report. Generally, financial reports need to be reviewed for medium entities or audited for large entities.

     * Additional reporting obligations may be placed on registered entities by the Commissioner in special circumstances, for example, if the Commissioner is concerned about an entity's compliance with this Act.

##### Subdivision 60AA--Object of this Division

##### 603  Object of this Division

     * (1) The object of this Division is to promote:

      * (a) the transparency and accountability of registered entities; and

      * (b) the reduction of reporting obligations of registered entities under other Australian laws.

     * (2) The Division does this by requiring registered entities to provide information to the Commissioner that:

      * (a) relates to this Act or the taxation law; and

      * (b) the Commissioner:

       * (i) will use for the purposes of this Act; or

       * (ii) may pass on to other Australian government agencies, removing the need for those agencies to require the information from the registered entities; or

       * (iii) will make publicly available by publishing it on the Register.

          * Note 1: Other Australian laws provide that giving information to the Commissioner in accordance with this Act satisfies the reporting requirements of those laws.

          * Note 2: Division 40 limits the information the Commissioner may publish on the Register.

     * (3) The requirements this Division places on a registered entity are proportional to the size of the registered entity.

#### Division 100--Suspension and removal of responsible entities

##### Subdivision 100A--Overview

##### 1001  Simplified outline

     * The following is a simplified outline of this Division: 

     * The Commissioner's guidance and education (see section 11010) will assist registered entities to comply with and understand their obligations under this Act. However, where enforcement action is required, the Commissioner's range of enforcement powers includes the power to suspend or remove a responsible entity of a registered entity, so that the Commissioner can provide a proportionate and effective regulatory response.

     * The Commissioner may suspend or remove a responsible entity of a registered entity if: 

         * (a) the registered entity is a federally regulated entity and the Commissioner reasonably believes that the registered entity has contravened a provision of this Act, or that it is more likely than not that the registered entity will contravene a provision of this Act; or

         * (b) the registered entity is a federally regulated entity and the Commissioner reasonably believes that the registered entity has not complied with a governance standard, or that it is more likely than not that the registered entity will not comply with a governance standard; or

         * (c) the Commissioner reasonably believes that the registered entity has not complied with an external conduct standard, or that it is more likely than not that the registered entity will not comply with an external conduct standard.

     * The Commissioner may only do so if the suspension or removal is necessary to address the contravention or noncompliance, and may only do so after considering a range of policy matters.

     * A decision of the Commissioner to suspend or remove a responsible entity is reviewable in accordance with Part 72.

     * The Commissioner may appoint acting responsible entities to replace suspended or removed responsible entities, so that the registered entity may continue to function.

     * Subdivision 100D deals with the property of a registered entity that is a trust, if a trustee of the trust is suspended or removed.

##### Subdivision 100B--Suspension and removal of responsible entities

##### 1005  Commissioner's exercise of power under this Subdivision

     * (1) The Commissioner can exercise a power under this Subdivision in relation to a registered entity only if:

      * (a) the registered entity is a federally regulated entity and the Commissioner reasonably believes that:

       * (i) the registered entity has contravened a provision of this Act; or

       * (ii) it is more likely than not that the registered entity will contravene a provision of this Act; or

      * (b) the registered entity is a federally regulated entity and the Commissioner reasonably believes that:

       * (i) the registered entity has not complied with a governance standard; or

       * (ii) it is more likely than not that the registered entity will not comply with a governance standard; or

      * (c) the Commissioner reasonably believes that:

       * (i) the registered entity has not complied with an external conduct standard; or

       * (ii) it is more likely than not that the registered entity will not comply with an external conduct standard.

     * (2) This Subdivision does not apply to an entity that is a responsible entity of the registered entity only because of paragraph 20530(c) (about trustees in bankruptcy, liquidators etc.).

     * (3) The Commissioner cannot exercise a power under this Subdivision in relation to a registered entity that is a basic religious charity.

     * (6) Subsections (4) and (5) do not apply if the Commissioner believes, on reasonable grounds and taking into account the matters mentioned in subsection 3510(2), that it would be appropriate for the Commissioner to suspend the responsible entity without giving a show cause notice to the registered entity.

##### 10015  Removal of responsible entities

     * Removal

     * (1) The Commissioner may remove any of the responsible entities of the registered entity if the Commissioner considers that doing so is necessary to address the contravention or noncompliance mentioned in subsection 1005(1) (or prevent the likely contravention or noncompliance mentioned in that subsection).

     * (4) The show cause notice must:

##### 10020  Effect of suspension or removal--suspended or removed responsible entities must not be reappointed

     * (1) A responsible entity suspended under section 10010 cannot become a responsible entity of the registered entity until the suspension ends.

     * (2) A responsible entity removed under section 10015 cannot become a responsible entity of the registered entity.

     * (3) If:

      * (a) an individual is a responsible entity of a registered entity because:

       * (i) the registered entity is a company (or is a trust, a trustee of which is a company); and

       * (ii) the individual is a director of the company; and

      * (b) the individual is suspended under section 10010 or removed under section 10015;

     * the individual ceases to be a director of the company (until, in the case of suspension, the suspension ends).

         * Note: Suspension or removal of an individual as a responsible entity does not necessarily affect the rights or duties of the individual in other capacities.

         * For example, under the governing rules of an incorporated sporting club an individual may be a director of the club (and therefore a responsible entity) because he or she is the club captain. Removal of the individual as a responsible entity may not in itself remove the individual from the office of club captain.

##### 10025  Effect of suspension or removal--prohibition on managing the registered entity

     * (1) An entity commits an offence if:

      * (a) the entity is suspended under section 10010 or removed under section 10015; and

       * Penalty: Imprisonment for 1 year or 50 penalty units, or both.

     * (3) An entity commits an offence if:

      * (b) the entity is an individual; and

      * (c) the entity communicates instructions or wishes to the remaining responsible entities of the registered entity:

       * (i) knowing that those responsible entities are accustomed to act in accordance with the suspended or removed entity's instructions or wishes; or

       * (ii) intending that those responsible entities will act in accordance with those instructions or wishes; and

      * (d) the communication of those instructions or wishes is not advice given by the entity in the proper performance of functions attaching to the entity's professional capacity or his or her business relationship with the remaining responsible entities of the registered entity.

       * Penalty: Imprisonment for 1 year or 50 penalty units, or both.

##### Subdivision 175A--Overview

##### 1751  Simplified outline

     * The following is a simplified outline of this Division: 

     * Subdivision 175B sets out the circumstances in which administrative penalties apply for making false or misleading statements. It also sets out the amounts of those penalties.

     * An entity is liable to an administrative penalty if the entity is required to give a report, return, notice, statement or other document to the Commissioner by a particular time and the entity does not do so. Subdivision 175C sets out when the penalty applies and how the amounts of the penalty are calculated.

##### Subdivision 175B--Penalties for statements

##### 1755  Application of this Subdivision to statements

     * (1) This Subdivision applies to a statement made orally, in a document, or in any other way (including electronically) for a purpose connected with this Act.

     * (2) This Subdivision applies to a statement made by an entity's agent as if it had been made by the entity.

##### 17510  Penalty for false or misleading statements

     * (1) An entity is liable to an administrative penalty if:

      * (a) the entity makes a statement to the Commissioner or to an entity that is exercising powers or performing functions under this Act; and

      * (b) the statement is false or misleading in a material particular, whether because of things in it or omitted from it.

         * Note: This section applies to a statement made by an entity's agent as if it had been made by the entity (see subsection 1755(2)).

     * (2) An entity is liable to an administrative penalty if:

      * (a) the entity makes a statement to an entity other than:

       * (i) the Commissioner; or

       * (ii) an entity exercising powers or performing functions under this Act; and

      * (b) the statement is, or purports to be, one required or permitted by this Act; and

      * (c) the statement is false or misleading in a material particular, whether because of things in it or omitted from it.

     * Exception for reasonable care

     * (3) The entity is not liable to an administrative penalty under this section if the entity, and the entity's agent (if relevant), took reasonable care in connection with the making of the statement.

##### 17515  Amount of penalty

     * Base penalty amount

     * (1) Work out the base penalty amount under section 17520.

     * Adjustments

     * (2) Increase the amount in accordance with section 17525.

     * (3) Decrease the amount in accordance with section 17530.

     * Amount of penalty

     * (4) The result is the amount of the penalty.

##### 17520  Base penalty amount

     * (1) The **_base penalty amount_** under this Subdivision is worked out using this table:

     * (2) If 2 or more items in that table apply and one of them produces a greater base penalty amount than any of the others, use that item.

     * (3) If, apart from this subsection, the entity would have a base penalty amount because the entity or its agent treated this Act as applying in a particular way, and that way agreed with:

      * (a) advice given to the entity or its agent by or on behalf of the Commissioner; or

      * (b) general administrative practice under this Act; or

      * (c) a statement in a publication approved in writing by the Commissioner;

     * the base penalty amount is reduced to the extent that it was caused by that treatment.

##### 17525  Increase in penalty

     * Increase the amount by 20% of the base penalty amount if:

      * (a) the entity took steps to prevent or obstruct the Commissioner from finding out about the false or misleading nature of the relevant statement; or

      * (b) the entity:

       * (i) became aware of the false or misleading nature of the relevant statement made to the Commissioner or another entity after the statement had been made; and

       * (ii) did not tell the Commissioner or other entity about it within a reasonable time; or

      * (c) the entity had previously been liable to a penalty under this Subdivision.

##### 17530  Reduction of penalty if entity voluntarily tells the Commissioner

     * (1) Reduce the amount by 20% of the base penalty amount if:

      * (a) the Commissioner tells the entity that an examination is to be made of the entity's affairs relating to this Act; and

      * (b) _after_ that time, the entity voluntarily tells the Commissioner, in the approved form, about the false or misleading nature of the relevant statement; and

      * (c) telling the Commissioner can reasonably be estimated to have saved the Commissioner a significant amount of time or significant resources in the examination.

     * (2) Reduce the amount to nil if the entity voluntarily tells the Commissioner, in the approved form, about the false or misleading nature of the relevant statement _before_:

      * (a) the day the Commissioner tells the entity that an examination is to be made of the entity's affairs relating to this Act; or

      * (b) if the Commissioner makes a public statement requesting entities to make a voluntary disclosure by a particular earlier day about a matter that applies to its affairs--that earlier day.

     * (3) If the entity voluntarily tells the Commissioner, in the approved form, about the false or misleading nature of the statement _after_ the Commissioner tells the entity that an examination is to be conducted of the entity's affairs relating to this Act, the Commissioner may treat the entity as having done so _before_ being told about the examination if the Commissioner considers it appropriate to do so in the circumstances.

##### Subdivision 175C--Penalties for failing to lodge documents on time

##### 17535  Liability to penalty

     * An entity is liable to an administrative penalty if:

      * (b) the entity does not give the report, return, notice, statement or document to the Commissioner in the approved form by that day.

##### 17540  Amount of penalty

     * (1) The amount of the penalty is:

      * (a) if the entity is a medium registered entity--double the base penalty amount; or

      * (b) if the entity is a large registered entity--5 times the base penalty amount; or

      * (c) otherwise--the base penalty amount.

     * (2) The **_base penalty amount_** under this Subdivision is 1 penalty unit for each period of 28 days or part of a period of 28 days:

      * (a) starting on the day when the report, return, notice, statement or other document is due; and

      * (b) ending when the entity gives it;

     * (up to a maximum of 5 penalty units).

         * Note: See section 4AA of the _Crimes Act 1914_ for the current value of a penalty unit.

         * Example: An entity lodges a return 31 days late. The base penalty amount under subsection (2) is 2 penalty units.

     * (3) In working out the base penalty amount, the amount of a penalty unit is the amount applying at the start of the relevant 28day period.

     * (4) The fact that the entity has not yet given the relevant report, return, notice or other document does not prevent the Commissioner notifying the entity that it is liable to an administrative penalty under this Subdivision. That penalty may be later increased under this section.

         * Note: The Commissioner is required to notify the entity of an administrative penalty (see section 17550).

##### Subdivision 175D--Machinery provisions for administrative penalties

      * (a) treat the penalty in the same way as a primary tax debt; and

      * (b) treat general interest charge (if any) under section 17565 in respect of the penalty in the same way as a primary tax debt.

         * Note: This allows the Commissioner of Taxation to add the penalty to an entity's running balance account.

     * (2) For the purposes of Chapter 4 in Schedule 1 to the _Taxation Administration Act 1953_ (Generic collection and recovery rules):

      * (a) treat the penalty in the same way as a taxrelated liability; and

      * (b) treat general interest charge (if any) under section 17565 in respect of the penalty in the same way as a taxrelated liability.

         * Note 1: When the penalty is due and payable (see section 17555), it is a debt due to the Commonwealth and payable to the Commissioner of Taxation (see section 2555 in Schedule 1 to the _Taxation Administration Act 1953_).

     * (4) If the Commissioner later remits all or a part of the penalty under section 17560, the Commissioner must notify the Commissioner of Taxation that he or she has done so.

     * (5) The Commissioner of Taxation must notify the Commissioner of any action taken to recover a debt attributable to the penalty, if the Commissioner requests the Commissioner of Taxation in writing to do so.

## Chapter 8--Interpretation

### Part 81--Core concepts

#### Division 205--Core concepts

##### Subdivision 205A--Entities

##### 2055  Entities

     * (1) **_Entity_** means any of the following:

      * (a) an individual;

      * (b) a body corporate;

      * (c) a body politic;

      * (d) any other unincorporated association or body of persons;

      * (e) a trust.

         * Note: The term **_entity_** is used in a number of different but related senses. It covers all kinds of legal person. It also covers groups of legal persons, and other things, that in practice are treated as having a separate identity in the same way as a legal person does.

     * (2) Paragraph (1)(d) does not include a nonentity joint venture (within the meaning of the _Income Tax Assessment Act 1997_).

     * (3) The trustee of a trust is taken to be an entity consisting of the person who is the trustee, or the persons who are the trustees, at any given time.

         * Note 1: This is because a right or obligation cannot be conferred or imposed on an entity that is not a legal person.

         * Note 2: The entity that is the trustee of a trust does not change merely because of a change in the person who is the trustee of the trust, or persons who are the trustees of the trust.

     * (4) A legal person can have a number of different capacities in which the person does things. In each of those capacities, the person is taken to be a different entity.

         * Example: In addition to his or her personal capacity, an individual may be:

          * (a) sole trustee of one or more trusts; and

          * (b) one of a number of trustees of a further trust.

         * In his or her personal capacity, he or she is one entity. As trustee of each trust, he or she is a different entity. The trustees of the further trust are a different entity again, of which the individual is a member.

     * (5) If a provision refers to an entity of a particular kind, it refers to the entity in its capacity as that kind of entity, not to that entity in any other capacity.

         * Example: A provision that refers to a company does not cover a company in a capacity as trustee, unless it also refers to a trustee.

##### 20510  Companies

     * In this Act: 

     * **_company_** means:

      * (a) a body corporate; or

      * (b) any unincorporated association or body of persons;

     * but does not include a partnership.

##### 20515  Federally regulated entity

     * A **_federally regulated entity_** is:

      * (a) a constitutional corporation; or

      * (b) a trust, all of the trustees of which are constitutional corporations; or

      * (c) a body corporate that is taken to be registered in a Territory under section 119A of the _Corporations Act 2001_; or

      * (d) a trust, if the proper law of the trust and the law of the trust's administration are the law of a Territory; or

      * (e) an entity, the core or routine activities of which are carried out in or in connection with a Territory.

##### 20520  Constitutional corporation

     * An entity is a **_constitutional corporation_** if it is:

      * (a) a corporation to which paragraph 51(xx) of the Constitution applies; or

      * (b) a body corporate that is incorporated in a Territory.
