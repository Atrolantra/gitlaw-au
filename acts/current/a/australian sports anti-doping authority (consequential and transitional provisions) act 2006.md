##### Part 2--Assets, liabilities and legal proceedings

##### 2  Vesting of assets of ASDA

   * (1) This item applies to the assets of the ASDA immediately before the transition time.

   * (2) At the transition time, the assets cease to be assets of the ASDA and become assets of the Commonwealth without any conveyance, transfer or assignment. The Commonwealth becomes the successor in law in relation to the assets.

##### 3  Vesting of liabilities of ASDA

   * (1) This item applies to the liabilities of the ASDA immediately before the transition time.

   * (2) At the transition time, the liabilities cease to be liabilities of the ASDA and become liabilities of the Commonwealth without any conveyance, transfer or assignment. The Commonwealth becomes the successor in law in relation to the liabilities.

##### 4  Certificates relating to vesting of assets other than land

   * (1) This item applies if:

     * (a) any asset other than land vests in the Commonwealth under this Part; and

     * (b) there is lodged with an assets official a certificate that:

      * (i) is signed by the Minister; and

      * (ii) proceedings taken against the ASDA in respect of a liability that is vested in the Commonwealth by item 3;

   * the Commonwealth is substituted for the ASDA, from the transition time, as a party to the proceedings.

   * (2) To avoid doubt, if:

     * (a) any proceedings to which the ASDA was a party were pending in any court or tribunal immediately before the transition time; and

     * (b) the proceedings were not, and were not related to:

      * (i) proceedings taken by the ASDA in the exercise of a right that is vested in the Commonwealth by item 2; or

   * section 25B of the _Acts Interpretation Act 1901_ applies in relation to the proceedings.

   * Note: After the transition time, the ASADA will be a party to the proceedings. This is because the body corporate that is the ASDA continues in existence as the ASADA after the transition time (see section 20 of the ASADA Act and section 25B of the _Acts Interpretation Act 1901_).

   * (3) The regulations may determine that one of subitems (1) and (2), rather than the other of those subitems, applies in relation to a particular proceeding or a class of proceedings.
