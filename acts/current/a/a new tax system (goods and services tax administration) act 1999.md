#### Division 1--Introduction

##### 19  Overview

   * This Part sets out administrative provisions for the GST and should be read in conjunction with the _A New Tax System (Goods and Services Tax) Act 1999_.

   * Other provisions of this Act can also affect the way the GST is administered.

      * Example: It is an offence under section 8C to fail to notify the Commissioner of a change of address as required by subsection 67(2).

##### 20  Meaning of expressions

   * (1) In this Part:

   * **_GST Act_** means the _A New Tax System (Goods and Services Tax) Act 1999_.

   * **_authorised officer_**, when used in a particular provision, means a person the Commissioner has authorised to exercise powers or perform functions under that provision.

   * (2) Other expressions in this Part have the same meaning as in the GST Act_._

##### _21  Application of the Criminal Code

   * The _Criminal Code_ applies to all offences against this Part.

#### Division 2--Assessments

##### 22  Commissioner may make assessment of GST

   * (1) The Commissioner may at any time make an assessment of your net amount for a tax period.

   * (2) The Commissioner may at any time make an assessment of the amount of GST payable by you on an importation of goods.

   * (3) The Commissioner may make an assessment under this section even if he or she has already made an assessment for the tax period or importation concerned.

     * Note: An assessment made under this section is a reviewable GST decision (see Division 7).

##### 23  Request for assessment

   * (1) You may request the Commissioner in the approved form to make an assessment of your net amount for a tax period or of an amount of GST payable by you on an importation of goods.

   * (2) The Commissioner must comply with the request if it is made within:

    * (a) 4 years after the end of the tax period or the time of the importation; or

    * (b) such further period as the Commissioner allows.

##### 24  GST liabilities do not depend on assessment

   * (1) Your liability to pay GST, and the time by which a net amount or an amount of GST must be paid, do not depend on, and are not in any way affected by, the making of an assessment under this Division.

   * (2) The Commissioner's obligation to pay a net amount under section 35-5 of the GST Act, and the time by which it must be paid, do not depend on, and are not in any way affected by, the making of an assessment under this Division.

     * Note: However, an assessment can be used as evidence of liability: see section 59.

##### 25  Commissioner must give notice of the assessment

   * (1) The Commissioner must give you notice of an assessment as soon as practicable after the assessment is made. However, failing to do so does not affect the validity of the assessment.

   * (2) The Commissioner may give you the notice electronically if you are required to lodge or have lodged your GST returns electronically.

##### 26  Amendment of assessment

   * The Commissioner may at any time amend an assessment. An amended assessment is an assessment for all purposes of the GST law.

     * Note: However, there is a time limit on the recovery of overpaid or underpaid GST: see sections 35 and 36.

##### 27  Later assessment prevails in case of inconsistency

   * If there is an inconsistency between assessments that relate to the same tax period or importation of goods, the later assessment prevails to the extent of the inconsistency.

#### Division 3--Recovery

##### 28  Recovery of unpaid GST and penalty

   * (1) The Commissioner or a Deputy Commissioner may, in his or her official name, sue for and recover in a court of competent jurisdiction a net amount or an amount of GST that remains unpaid after the time by which it must be paid, or an amount of penalty under this Part.

   * (2) Section 8ZL (which deals with averments) applies in proceedings for the recovery of the amount in a corresponding way to the way in which it applies to a prosecution for a prescribed taxation offence within the meaning of Part III.

   * (3) A notice under section 47 that the Commissioner gives to an entity is prima facie evidence of the matters stated in the notice.

##### 29  Payment when multiple amounts owing

   * (1) This section applies if an entity must pay 2 or more of any of the following:

    * (a) net amounts;

    * (b) amounts of GST;

    * (c) amounts of penalty under this Part;

   * and the total of those amounts is more than a payment that the entity makes to the Commissioner in respect of one or more of the amounts, or a net amount under section 35-5 of the GST Act that the Commissioner must pay to the entity.

   * (2) The Commissioner may:

    * (a) apply the payment or amount in partial discharge of the total of the amounts payable by the entity, in the order in which they became payable unless the Commissioner determines a different order; and

    * (b) recover the remaining balance as a debt due to the Commonwealth.

   * (3) The Commissioner may do those things despite any direction by or on behalf of the entity who is liable to pay the amounts or the entity who makes the payment.

##### 30  Recovery of GST paid on behalf of another entity

   * If you pay a net amount, amount of GST or amount of penalty under this Part for or on behalf of another entity you may:

    * (a) recover the amount from the other entity as a debt (together with the cost of recovery) in any court of competent jurisdiction; or

    * (b) retain or deduct the amount out of money in your hands that belongs to, or is payable to, the other entity.

##### 31  Recovery of GST if joint liability

   * (1) If 2 or more entities are jointly liable to pay a net amount, amount of GST or amount of penalty under this Part, they are each liable for the whole of the amount.

   * (2) However, any of them who has paid the amount may recover the following contribution from any other entity jointly liable to pay the amount:

   * where: 

   * **_interest_** means:

    * (a) if the amount is a net amount--interest in the taxable supplies, creditable acquisitions and creditable importations from which that amount is worked out; and

    * (b) if the amount is an amount of GST--interest in the taxable importation that gave rise to the amount; and

    * (c) if the amount is an amount of penalty--interest in the event, or unsatisfied obligation, that gave rise to the penalty.

   * (3) The entity entitled to the contribution:

    * (a) may recover it as a debt in any court of competent jurisdiction; or

    * (b) may retain or deduct it out of money in the entity's hands that belongs to, or is payable to, the contributor.

##### 32  Recovery of GST from trustee of deceased estate

   * (1) This section applies if, at the time of a person's death, a net amount or amount of GST that the person must pay has not been paid.

   * (2) The Commissioner has the same powers and remedies for the assessment and recovery of the amount from the trustee of the person's estate as the Commissioner would have had against the person if he or she were still alive.

   * (3) The trustee must provide any GST returns and other information that the person was required to provide, or would have been required to provide if he or she had not died. The trustee must also provide any other GST returns or other information that the Commissioner requires.

   * (4) If the trustee fails to provide any GST return or other information, the Commissioner may make an assessment of a net amount or amount of GST in relation to the deceased person.

     * Note: An assessment made under this subsection is a reviewable GST decision (see Division 7).

   * (5) The trustee is liable to penalty under this Part for an unpaid net amount or unpaid GST to the same extent as the deceased person would be if he or she were still alive.

   * (6) Any amount payable by the trustee is a charge on all of the deceased person's estate in the trustee's hands in priority to any other encumbrance (other than a charge in relation to a debt payable to the Commissioner).

##### 33  Recovery of GST from unadministered deceased estate

   * (1) This section applies if neither of the following are granted within 6 months after a person's death:

    * (a) probate of the person's will;

    * (b) letters of administration of the person's estate.

   * (2) The Commissioner may make an assessment of a net amount or amount of GST in relation to the deceased person. If the person resided in a State or Territory at the time of death, the Commissioner must publish notice of the assessment twice in a daily newspaper circulating in the State or Territory.

   * (3) Anyone who:

    * (a) claims an interest in the estate; or

    * (b) is granted probate of the deceased person's will, or letters of administration of the estate;

   * and who is dissatisfied with the assessment, may object in the manner set out in Part IVC. That Part applies in relation to the objection as if the person were the deceased person.

##### 34  Recovery from third party

   * (1) The Commissioner may direct an entity (the**_ third party_**) who owes, or may later owe, money (the**_ available money_**) to another entity that has a GST debt (the **_GST debtor_**) to pay some or all of the available money to the Commissioner in accordance with the direction.

   * (2) The Commissioner must give a copy of the direction to the GST debtor.

   * (3) The direction cannot require an amount to be paid to the Commissioner at a time before it becomes owing by the third party to the GST debtor.

   * (4) The third party is guilty of an offence if the third party fails to comply with the direction, so far as the third party is able to do so.

     * Maximum penalty: 20 penalty units.

     * Note 1: Chapter 2 of the _Criminal Code_ sets out the general principles of criminal responsibility.

     * Note 2: See section 4AA of the _Crimes Act 1914 _for the current value of a penalty unit.

   * (5) If an entity is convicted of an offence in relation to a refusal or failure of the third party to comply with subsection (4), the court may (in addition to imposing a penalty on the convicted entity) order the convicted entity to pay to the Commissioner an amount up to the amount involved in the refusal or failure.

   * (6) Any payment made by the third party under this section is taken to have been made with the authority of the GST debtor and of all other entities concerned, and the third party is indemnified for the payment.

   * (7) If the whole of the GST debt of the GST debtor is discharged before any payment is made by the third party, the Commissioner must immediately withdraw the direction and notify the third party that it has been withdrawn.

   * (8) For the purposes of this section, the third party is taken to owe money to the GST debtor if:

    * (a) money is due or accruing by the third party to the GST debtor; or

    * (b) the third party holds money for or on account of the GST debtor; or

    * (c) the third party holds money on account of some other entity for payment to the GST debtor; or

    * (d) the third party has authority from some other entity to pay money to the GST debtor;

   * even if the payment of the money to the GST debtor is dependent on a pre-condition that has not been fulfilled.

   * (9) For the purposes of this section, money that has been paid by an entity to a building society for the issue of withdrawable shares in the capital of the society, but has not been repaid, is taken to be:

    * (a) if the money is repayable on demand--money due by the building society to the entity;

    * (b) if the money is not repayable on demand--money that may become due by the building society to the entity.

   * (10) In this section:

   * **_building society_** means a society registered or incorporated as a building society, co-operative housing society or other similar society under the law in force in a State or Territory.

   * **_GST debt_** means any of the following amounts payable by an entity (whether or not the amount has become due for payment):

    * (a) a net amount or amount of GST;

    * (b) penalty under this Part;

    * (c) a judgment debt, or costs, for GST or penalty under this Part;

    * (d) a fine, or costs, that a court has imposed for an offence against the GST law;

    * (e) an amount that a court has ordered the entity to pay to the Commissioner, following conviction of the entity for an offence against the GST law.

##### 35  Time limit on recovering unpaid GST

   * A net amount or an amount of GST that has not been paid within 4 years after the time when it became payable by you (together with any relevant penalty under section 40 for unpaid GST) ceases to be payable at the end of that period, unless:

    * (a) within that period the Commissioner has required payment of the amount by giving a notice to you; or

    * (b) the Commissioner is satisfied that the payment of the amount was avoided by fraud or evaded.

##### 36  Time limit on credits and refunds

   * You are not entitled to a refund under section 35-5 of the GST Act or an input tax credit, that is attributable to a particular tax period, unless:

    * (a) within 4 years after the end of the tax period you notify the Commissioner (in a GST return or otherwise) that you are entitled to the refund or credit; or

    * (b) within that period the Commissioner notifies you (in a notice of assessment or otherwise) that you are entitled to the refund or credit; or

    * (c) in the case of a credit--the credit is taken into account in working out a net amount that the Commissioner may recover from you only because of paragraph 35(b) of this Act.

##### 37  Reliance on Commissioner's interpretation of GST law

   * (1) This section applies to you if:

    * (a) the Commissioner alters a previous ruling that applied to you; and

    * (b) relying on the previous ruling, you have underpaid a net amount or an amount of GST, or the Commissioner has overpaid an amount under section 35-5 of the GST Act, in respect of one or more taxable supplies or taxable importations that happened before the alteration.

   * (2) Unless the Commissioner is satisfied that you contributed to the giving, or continuing in force, of the earlier ruling by a misstatement or by suppressing a material fact:

    * (a) the underpaid GST ceases to be payable; or

    * (b) the overpaid amount under section 35-5 of the GST Act is taken to have been payable in full;

   * from when the previous ruling was made.

   * (3) The following rules apply in deciding whether a ruling applies to you, or whether a ruling has been altered:

    * (a) a private ruling applies only to the entity to whom it was given;

    * (b) so far as a private ruling conflicts with an earlier public ruling, the private ruling prevails;

    * (c) so far as a public ruling conflicts with an earlier private ruling, the public ruling prevails;

    * (d) an alteration that a later ruling makes to an earlier ruling is disregarded so far as the alteration results from a change in the law that came into operation after the earlier ruling was given.

   * (4) In this section:

   * **_private ruling_** means a ruling given to a particular entity.

   * **_public ruling_** means a ruling other than a private ruling.

   * **_ruling_** means any ruling or advice given or published by the Commissioner, including one that has been previously altered, but not including:

    * (a) one given orally; or

    * (b) an assessment.

##### 38  Refunds if earlier GST return not provided

   * (1) The Commissioner may withhold a net amount for a tax period that he or she must pay to you under section 35-5 of the GST Act, if you have not given the Commissioner:

    * (a) a GST return for an earlier tax period that you must give to the Commissioner; or

    * (b) a further or fuller GST return for the first-mentioned tax period or an earlier tax period if the Commissioner has asked you to provide it under section 31-20 of the GST Act.

   * (2) The Commissioner must pay the amount within 14 days after you give the Commissioner the GST return or further or fuller GST return (and no interest is payable on the amount in the meantime).

   * (3) However, if the Commissioner makes an assessment of your net amount for the tax period to which the GST return relates, or further or fuller GST return relates, at any time before the GST return, or further or fuller GST return, is given to the Commissioner, he or she must pay the withheld amount to you when the assessment is made.

     * Note: The Commissioner may apply the amount against other liabilities that you have: see subsection 35-5(2) of the GST Act.

##### 39  Refund of amounts overpaid by you or owing to you

   * (1) The Commissioner must refund to you:

    * (a) so much of any net amount or amount of GST as you have overpaid; and

    * (b) so much of any net amount that is payable to you under section 35-5 of the GST Act as the Commissioner has not paid to you.

   * (2) However, if you have a liability to the Commonwealth under a taxation law, the Commissioner may:

    * (a) apply that amount against the liability; and

    * (b) pay to you any part of that amount not so applied.

   * (3) The Commissioner need not give you the refund, or apply the amount under subsection (2), if:

    * (a) you overpaid the amount, or the amount was not refunded to you, because a supply was treated as a taxable supply to any extent; and

    * (b) the supply is not a taxable supply to that extent (for example, because it is GST-free);

   * unless: 

    * (c) the Commissioner is satisfied that you have reimbursed a corresponding amount to the recipient of the supply; and

    * (d) the recipient is neither registered nor required to be registered.

#### Division 4--Penalties

##### 40  Penalty for unpaid GST

   * (1) If a net amount or an amount of GST that is payable by you remains unpaid after the day by which it must be paid, you are liable to a penalty at the rate of 16% per year on the unpaid amount.

   * (2) The penalty is calculated from:

    * (a) the day on which the amount becomes due to be paid, ignoring any extension of time to pay the amount given by the Commissioner under section 33-20 of the GST Act; or

    * (b) a later day determined by the Commissioner if the Commissioner has extended the time to pay the amount, or permitted it to be paid by instalments, under that section.

   * (3) The fact that a judgment is entered or given in a court for the payment of a net amount or amount of GST, or of a composite amount that includes a net amount or an amount of GST, does not of itself cause the net amount or amount of GST to stop being unpaid for the purposes of this section.

   * (4) If the judgment debt bears interest, the penalty payable under this section is reduced (but not beyond nil) by the following amount:

   * where: 

   * **_net amount or GST component _**means the net amount, or GST, component of the judgment debt.

##### 41  Penalty for failing to make electronic payment

   * If you must pay a net amount by electronic payment under subsection 33-10(2) of the GST Act and you pay it in some other way, you are liable to a penalty of 5 penalty units.

     * Note: See section 4AA of the _Crimes Act 1914 _for the current value of a penalty unit.

##### 42  Penalty for failing to register or cancel registration

   * If you fail to apply for registration, or to apply for cancellation of registration, as required by the GST Act, you are liable to a penalty of 20 penalty units.

     * Note: See section 4AA of the _Crimes Act 1914 _for the current value of a penalty unit.

##### 43  Penalty for failing to give GST return or other information

   * (1) You are liable to a penalty if you fail to give the Commissioner on time a GST return that you are required to give by Division 31 of the GST Act. The penalty is $10 for each week (or part of a week) in the period that:

    * (a) starts on the day by which you must give the GST return to the Commissioner; and

    * (b) ends on the day before you give the GST return to the Commissioner.

   * However, the penalty for a particular GST return cannot exceed $200.

   * (2) You are liable to a penalty if you fail to give the Commissioner on time any information (other than information you are required to give in a GST return) on a taxable supply or taxable importation that you are required to give under the GST law. The penalty is equal to double the amount of GST payable on the taxable supply or taxable importation.

   * (3) You are liable to a penalty if:

    * (a) you fail to give the Commissioner on time any information (other than information you are required to give in a GST return) on a creditable acquisition or a creditable importation; and

    * (b) the net amount for the tax period concerned, worked out without knowing that information, is less than it would be if the information had been known.

   * The penalty is equal to double the difference.

##### 44  Penalty for failing to issue tax invoice or adjustment note

   * (1) If you fail to issue a tax invoice as required by section 29-70 of the GST Act, you are liable to a penalty of 20 penalty units.

   * (2) If you fail to issue an adjustment note as required by section 29-75 of the GST Act, you are liable to a penalty of 20 penalty units.

     * Note: See section 4AA of the _Crimes Act 1914 _for the current value of a penalty unit.

##### 45  Penalty for both principal and agent issuing certain documents

   * An entity is liable to a penalty if both the entity and its agent issue: 

    * (a) separate tax invoices relating to the same taxable supply, contrary to subsection 153-15(2) of the GST Act; or

    * (b) separate adjustment notes for the same decreasing adjustment, contrary to subsection 153-20(2) of that Act.

   * The penalty is 20 penalty units.

     * Note: See section 4AA of the _Crimes Act 1914 _for the current value of a penalty unit.

##### 46  Penalty for making false statements

   * (1) You are liable to a penalty if you make a false statement:

    * (a) to a tax officer; or

    * (b) to another entity who is not a tax officer, for a purpose in connection with the operation of the GST law;

   * (whether or not you know that it is a false statement) and either of these cases applies:

    * (c) the net amount or amount of GST properly payable by you, or by the other entity, exceeds the net amount or amount of GST that would have been payable if the statement was not false;

    * (d) the net amount or amount of GST that would have been payable, if the statement was not false, to you or to the other entity exceeds the net amount or amount of GST properly payable to you or to the other entity.

   * (2) The amount of the penalty is double the excess.

   * (3) In this section:

   * **_false statement_** means a statement (whether made orally, in a document or in any other way) that:

    * (a) is false or misleading in a material particular; or

    * (b) omits any matter or thing without which the statement is misleading in a material particular;

   * but does not include a statement made in a document produced under paragraph 65(1)(c).

   * **_tax officer_** means a person who is exercising powers, or performing functions, under or in connection with the GST law.

##### 47  Notification of penalty and due date for payment

   * (1) The Commissioner must notify an entity that is liable to a penalty under this Part (other than a penalty under section 40 for unpaid GST) of the amount of the penalty.

   * (4) The asset holder must not, without the Commissioner's permission, part with any of the company's assets before receiving the notice from the Commissioner.

    * (b) an attorney or agent of the company.

   * (2) The representative has the same liability in respect of the notice, process or proceeding as the company or public officer would have had if it had been given to, served on or taken against the company or public officer.

     * Note 1: Chapter 2 of the _Criminal Code_ sets out the general principles of criminal responsibility.

     * Note 2: See section 4AA of the _Crimes Act 1914 _for the current value of a penalty unit.

   * (9) In a prosecution of an entity for an offence that the entity is taken to have committed because of subsection (8), it is a defence if the entity proves that the entity:

    * (a) did not aid, abet, counsel or procure the relevant act or omission; and

    * (b) was not in any way knowingly concerned in, or party to, the relevant act or omission (whether directly or indirectly and whether by any act or omission of the entity).
