#### No. 63, 2014

### An Act to appropriate money out of the Consolidated Revenue Fund for the ordinary annual services of the Government, and for related purposes

##### [Assented to 30 June 2014]

### The Parliament of Australia enacts: 

### Part 1--Preliminary

##### 1  Short title

    * This Act may be cited as the _Appropriation Act (No. 1) 20142015_.

##### 2  Commencement

    * This Act commences on the day this Act receives the Royal Assent.

##### 3  Definitions

    * In this Act: 

    * **_administered item_** means an amount set out in Schedule 1 opposite an outcome for an Agency under the heading "Administered".

    * **_Agency_** means:

     * (a) an Agency within the meaning of the _Financial Management and Accountability Act 1997_; or

     * (b) the High Court of Australia.

    * **_CAC Act body_** means:

     * (a) a Commonwealth authority within the meaning of the _Commonwealth Authorities and Companies Act 1997_; or

     * (b) a Commonwealth company within the meaning of the _Commonwealth Authorities and Companies Act 1997_.

    * **_CAC Act body payment item_** means the total amount set out in Schedule 1 in relation to a CAC Act body under the heading "Administered".

      * Note: The amounts set out opposite outcomes for CAC Act bodies, under the heading "Administered", are "notional". They are not part of the item, and do not in any way restrict the scope of the expenditure authorised by the item.

    * **_current year_** means the financial year ending on 30 June 2015.

    * **_departmental item_** means the total amount set out in Schedule 1 in relation to an Agency under the heading "Departmental".

      * Note: The amounts set out opposite outcomes, under the heading "Departmental", are "notional". They are not part of the item, and do not in any way restrict the scope of the expenditure authorised by the item.

    * **_expenditure_** means payments for expenses, acquiring assets, making loans or paying liabilities.

    * **_Finance Minister_** means the Minister administering this Act.

    * **_item_** means an administered item or a departmental item.

    * **_Portfolio Budget Statements_** means the Portfolio Budget Statements that were tabled in the Senate or the House of Representatives in relation to the Bill for this Act.

    * **_Portfolio Statements_** means the Portfolio Budget Statements.

    * **_Special Account_** has the same meaning as in the _Financial Management and Accountability Act 1997_.

##### 4  Portfolio Statements

    * The Portfolio Statements are hereby declared to be relevant documents for the purposes of section 15AB of the _Acts Interpretation Act 1901_.

      * Note: See paragraph 15AB(2)(g) of the _Acts Interpretation Act 1901_.

##### 5  Notional payments, receipts etc.

    * For the purposes of this Act, notional transactions between Agencies are to be treated as if they were real transactions.

      * Note: This section applies, for example, to a "payment" between Agencies that are both part of the Commonwealth. One of the effects of this section is that the payment will be debited from an appropriation for the paying Agency, even though no payment is actually made from the Consolidated Revenue Fund.

### Part 2--Appropriation items

##### 6  Summary of appropriations

    * The total of the items specified in Schedule 1 is $79,789,007,000.

      * Note 1: Items in Schedule 1 can be adjusted under Part 3 of this Act.

      * Note 2: Sections 30 to 32 of the _Financial Management and Accountability Act 1997_ also provide for adjustments of amounts appropriated by this Act.

##### 7  Departmental items

    * The amount specified in a departmental item for an Agency may be applied for the departmental expenditure of the Agency.

      * Note: The Finance Minister manages the expenditure of public money through the issue of drawing rights under the _Financial Management and Accountability Act 1997_.

##### 8  Administered items

    * (1) The amount specified in an administered item for an outcome for an Agency may be applied for expenditure for the purpose of contributing to achieving that outcome.

      * Note: The Finance Minister manages the expenditure of public money through the issue of drawing rights under the _Financial Management and Accountability Act 1997_.

    * (2) If the Portfolio Statements indicate that activities of a particular kind were intended to be treated as activities in respect of a particular outcome, then expenditure for the purpose of carrying out those activities is taken to be expenditure for the purpose of contributing to achieving the outcome.

##### 9  CAC Act body payment items

    * (1) The amount specified in a CAC Act body payment item for a CAC Act body may be paid to the body to be applied for the purposes of the body.

      * Note: The Finance Minister manages the expenditure of public money through the issue of drawing rights under the _Financial Management and Accountability Act 1997_.

    * (2) If:

     * (a) an Act provides that a CAC Act body must be paid amounts that are appropriated by the Parliament for the purposes of the body; and

     * (b) Schedule 1 contains a CAC Act body payment item for that body;

    * then the body must be paid the full amount specified in the item.

### Part 3--Advance to the Finance Minister

##### 10  Advance to the Finance Minister

    * (1) This section applies if the Finance Minister is satisfied that there is an urgent need for expenditure, in the current year, that is not provided for, or is insufficiently provided for, in Schedule 1:

     * (a) because of an erroneous omission or understatement; or

     * (b) because the expenditure was unforeseen until after the last day on which it was practicable to provide for it in the Bill for this Act before that Bill was introduced into the House of Representatives.

    * (2) This Act has effect as if Schedule 1 were amended, in accordance with a determination of the Finance Minister, to make provision for so much (if any) of the expenditure as the Finance Minister determines.

    * (3) The total of the amounts determined under subsection (2) cannot be more than $295 million.

    * (4) A determination made under subsection (2) is a legislative instrument, but neither section 42 (disallowance) nor Part 6 (sunsetting) of the _Legislative Instruments Act 2003_ applies to the determination.

### Part 4--Miscellaneous

##### 11  Crediting amounts to Special Accounts

    * If any of the purposes of a Special Account is a purpose that is covered by an item (whether or not the item expressly refers to the Special Account), then amounts may be debited against the appropriation for that item and credited to that Special Account.

##### 12  Appropriation of the Consolidated Revenue Fund

    * The Consolidated Revenue Fund is appropriated as necessary for the purposes of this Act, including the operation of this Act as affected by the _Financial Management and Accountability Act 1997_.

##### 13  Act ceases to be in force

    * This Act ceases to be in force at the start of 1 July 2017.
