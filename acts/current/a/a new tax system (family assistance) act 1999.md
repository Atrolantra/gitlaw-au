##### 56  Circumstances when 24 hour care limit applies

    * Overview of section

    * (1) This section sets out the circumstances in which a 24 hour care limit for sessions of care provided to a child applies in a week to the eligibility of certain fee reduction claimants (see paragraph 52(1)(a)). A 24 hour care limit can only apply if the care is provided by an approved child care service other than an approved occasional care service.

    * Meaning of **fee reduction claimant **and** approved child care service**

    * **	(2)	In this section (other than subsection (1)):

     * (a) **_fee reduction claimant_** does not include an individual if the care the individual is eligible for is provided by an approved occasional care service; and

     * (b) **_approved child care service _**does not include an approved occasional care service.

    * 24 hour care certified by a service--if claimant is an individual

    * (3) Subject to subsection (5), a 24 hour care limit applies in the week to a fee reduction claimant who is an individual if the approved child care service providing care to the child certifies that the child needs, or needed, 24 hour care in the week for one or more 24 hour care periods specified in the certificate, because neither the claimant, nor the claimant's partner (if any), is able to care for the child during those periods for the reason that:

     * (a) both the claimant and the claimant's partner (if any) have work related commitments during those periods; or

     * (b) exceptional circumstances exist during those periods.

    * 24 hour care certified by a service--if claimant is a service

    * (4) Subject to subsection (5), a 24 hour care limit applies in the week to a fee reduction claimant that is an approved child care service if:

     * (a) the person in whose care the child last was before the first session of care in the week is an individual; and

     * (b) the service certifies that the child needs, or needed, 24 hour care in the week for one or more 24 hour care periods specified in the certificate, because neither the individual, nor the individual's partner (if any), is able to care for the child during those periods for the reason that:

      * (i) both the individual and that individual's partner (if any) have work related commitments during those periods; or

      * (ii) exceptional circumstances exist during those periods.

    * Limitation on service giving certificates under subsection (3) or (4)

    * (5) An approved child care service may only give a certificate under subsection (3) or (4) if the number of 24 hour care periods specified in the certificate in relation to a child, together with the number of 24 hour care periods specified in each other certificate (if any) given by the service, or any other approved child care service, in relation to the child and the same financial year, does not in total exceed 14.

    * 24 hour care decided by the Secretary

    * (6) Subject to subsection (7), a 24 hour care limit applies in the week to a fee reduction claimant if:

     * (a) the approved child care service providing care to the child has given a certificate under subsection (3) or (4) such that the total of the 24 hour care periods specified in that certificate and other certificates (if any) given by the service, or any other approved child care service, in respect of the child in the same financial year equals 14; and

     * (b) the Secretary considers that, at some time after those 14 24 hour care periods, the child needs or needed 24 hour care for one or more specified 24 hour care periods in the week because:

      * (i) in the case where the claimant is an individual--neither the claimant nor the claimant's partner (if any); or

      * (ii) in the case where the claimant is the approved child care service providing care to the child--neither the individual in whose care the child last was before the first session of care in the week nor the individual's partner (if any);

     * is able to care for the child during those periods; and

     * (c) the Secretary considers that the reason for that inability is:

      * (i) because both the individual and the individual's partner (if any) have work related commitments during those periods; or

      * (ii) because exceptional circumstances exist during those periods.

    * Limitation on Secretary's decision making under subsection (5)

    * (7) Subject to subsection (8), in respect of a child during a financial year, the Secretary may make a decision under subsection (6) in respect of only 14 24 hour care periods.

    * Maximum of 28 24 hour care periods may be lifted in certain circumstances

    * (8) If:

     * (a) in respect of the child during a financial year, there have already been certificates given, and decisions of the Secretary made, in which the total of the 24 hour care periods specified is 28; and

     * (b) the Secretary is satisfied that it is essential in the circumstances that the child receive one or more further periods of 24 hour care during the financial year;

     * (c) the Secretary considers that, at some time after those 28 24 hour care periods, the child needs or needed 24 hour care for one or more specified 24 hour care periods in the week because:

      * (i) in the case where the claimant is an individual--neither the claimant nor the claimant's partner (if any); or

      * (ii) in the case where the claimant is the approved child care service providing care to the child--neither the individual in whose care the child last was before the first session of care in the week nor the individual's partner (if any);

     * is able to care for the child during those periods; and

     * (d) the Secretary considers that the reason for that inability is:

      * (i) because both the individual and the individual's partner (if any) have work related commitments during those periods; or

      * (ii) because exceptional circumstances exist during those periods.

     * (b) by having regard to the actual circumstances during that period of any other child who is, from time to time, an FTB child, or a regular care child, of the individual.

##### 65  Calculation of single amount for death of FTB or regular care child

    * Instalment case

    * (1) The single amount of family tax benefit an individual is eligible for under subsection 32(1) is worked out as follows:

Method statement

      * Step 1.	Work out the rate of family tax benefit for which the individual would be eligible under this Act (other than under section 31) for the period (the **_lump sum period_**) beginning on the request day (see subsection 32(1)) and ending at the end of the section 31 accrual period (see subsection 32(1)) by applying the Rate Calculator in Schedule 1 on the following assumptions:

        * (a) that the child who died did not die and is an FTB child, or a regular care child, (as the case requires) of the individual for each day in the lump sum period;

        * (b) if on the request day the individual had any other children who were FTB children or regular care children--that each of those children is an FTB child, or a regular care child, (as the case requires) of the individual for each day in the lump sum period, other than an excluded day (see subsection (2)) in relation to the child;

        * (c) if the lump sum period extends over 2 income years--that the individual's adjusted taxable income for the lump sum period is the same as the individual's adjusted taxable income for the first of those income years.

      * Step 2.	If paragraph (b) of step 1 applies, work out the rate of family tax benefit for which the individual would be eligible under this Act (other than under section 31) for the lump sum period by applying the Rate Calculator in Schedule 1 on the following assumptions:

        * (a) that each child mentioned in that paragraph is an FTB child, or a regular care child, (as the case requires) of the individual for each day in that period, other than an excluded day (see subsection (2)) in relation to the child;

        * (b) if paragraph (c) of step 1 applies--the assumption in that paragraph.

      * Step 3.	The single amount is the step 1 amount less the step 2 amount (if any).

    * (2) For the purposes of the method statement in subsection (1), a day in the lump sum period is an **_excluded day_** in relation to the child if:

     * (a) where the child had turned 16 when the child died--the Secretary is satisfied the child would not have been a senior secondary school child on that day if the child had not died; or

     * (b) where the child had not turned 16 when the child died--the child would have been aged 16, and the Secretary is satisfied the child would not have been a senior secondary school child, on that day if the child had not died.

    * Other cases

    * (3) The single amount of family tax benefit an individual is eligible for under subsection 32(2) is worked out:

     * (a) by applying the method statement in subsection (1) of this section (disregarding paragraph (c) of step 1, and paragraph (b) of step 2, of the statement) as if a reference to the request day in that statement were a reference to the first day of the second of those income years (see subsection 32(2)); and

     * (b) on the assumption that the individual's adjusted taxable income for the period falling in the second of those income years is the same as the individual's adjusted taxable income for the first of those income years.

    * For the purposes of this Part, an individual's higher income free area is worked out using the following table. An individual's higher income free area is the basic amount in column 1 plus an additional amount in column 2 for each FTB child of the individual (after the first).

### Part 2--Part A rate (Method 1)

#### Division 1--Overall rate calculation process

##### 3  Method of calculating Part A rate

    * Subject to the operation of clauses 5, 38J and 38K, if the individual's Part A rate is to be calculated using this Part, it is calculated as follows: 

Method statement

      * Step 1.	Add the following amounts:

        * (a) the individual's standard rate under Division 2 of this Part (clauses 7 to 11);

        * (b) the individual's large family supplement (if any) under Division 1 of Part 5 (clauses 34 and 35);

        * (ba) the individual's newborn supplement (if any) under Division 1A of Part 5 (clauses 35A and 35B);

        * (c) the individual's multiple birth allowance (if any) under Division 2 of Part 5 (clauses 36 to 38);

        * (ca) the individual's FTB Part A supplement under Division 2A of Part 5 (clause 38A);

        * (cb) the individual's energy supplement (Part A) under Subdivision A of Division 2AA of Part 5 (clause 38AA);

        * (d) the individual's rent assistance (if any) under Subdivision A of Division 2B of Part 5 (clauses 38B to 38H).

      * The result is the individual's **_maximum rate_**.

      * Step 2.	Apply the income test in Division 2C of Part 5 (clauses 38L to 38N) to work out any reduction for adjusted taxable income. Take any reduction away from the individual's maximum rate: the result is the individual's **_income tested rate_**.

      * Step 3.	Apply the maintenance income test in Division 5 of this Part (clauses 20 to 24) to work out any reduction for maintenance income. Take any reduction away from the individual's income tested rate: the result is the individual's **_income and maintenance tested rate_**.

      * Step 4.	The individual's **_Part A rate _**is: 

        * (a) the individual's income and maintenance tested rate if it is equal to or greater than the individual's base rate (see clause 4); or

        * (b) the individual's base rate (see clause 4) if it is more than the individual's income and maintenance tested rate.

##### 4  Base rate

    * **_		_**The individual's **_base rate_** is the rate that would be the individual's Method 2 base rate under clause 25 if the individual's Part A rate were worked out using Part 3.

##### 5  Family tax benefit advance to individual

    * (1) If:

     * (a) an individual is entitled to be paid family tax benefit by instalment; and

     * (b) the individual is paid a family tax benefit advance; and

     * (c) the individual has not repaid the whole of the advance; and

     * (d) the amount of unrepaid family tax benefit advance is not an FTB advance debt;

    * then, subject to clauses 44 and 49, the individual's Part A rate (as reduced (if at all) under clauses 38J and 38K) is to be reduced in accordance with Division 4 of Part 5 (clauses 40 to 51).

    * (2) If an individual satisfies paragraphs (1)(a) to (d) for more than one family tax benefit advance, the individual's Part A rate is to be reduced under subclause (1) for each of those advances.

##### 6  Components of Part A rates under this Part

    * The Minister may, by legislative instrument, determine a method for working out the extent to which Part A rates under this Part are attributable to the amounts referred to in step 1 of the method statement in clause 3.

#### Division 2--Standard rate

##### 7  Standard rate

    * Subject to clauses 8 to 11, an individual's standard rate is worked out using the following table. Work out which category applies to each FTB child of the individual. The FTB child rate is the corresponding amount in column 2. The standard rate is the sum of the FTB child rates.

##### 8  Base FTB child rate

    * For the purposes of this Division, the **_base FTB child rate_** for an FTB child of an individual is the rate that would be the FTB child rate under subclause 26(2) if:

     * (a) the individual's Part A rate were being worked out under Part 3; and

     * (b) clause 27 did not apply.

##### 9  FTB child rate--recipient of other periodic payments

    * The FTB child rate for an FTB child of an individual is the base FTB child rate (see clause 8) if:

     * (a) the individual or the individual's partner is receiving a periodic payment under a law of the Commonwealth and the law provides for an increase in the rate of payment by reference to an FTB child of the individual; or

     * (b) the individual or the individual's partner is receiving a periodic payment under a scheme administered by the Commonwealth and the scheme provides for an increase in the rate of payment by reference to an FTB child of the individual.

##### 10  Effect of certain maintenance rights

    * (1) The FTB child rate for an FTB child of an individual is the base FTB child rate (see clause 8) if:

     * (a) the individual or the individual's partner is entitled to claim or apply for maintenance for the child; and

     * (b) the Secretary considers that it is reasonable for the individual or partner to take action to obtain maintenance; and

     * (c) the individual or partner does not take action that the Secretary considers reasonable to obtain maintenance.

    * (2) Subclause (1) does not apply to maintenance that is:

     * (a) a liability under an administrative assessment (within the meaning of the _Child Support (Assessment) Act 1989_); and

     * (b) not an enforceable maintenance liability (within the meaning of the _Child Support (Registration and Collection) Act 1988_).

##### 11  Sharing family tax benefit (shared care percentages)

    * If an individual has a shared care percentage for an FTB child of the individual, the FTB child rate for the child, in working out the individual's standard rate, is the individual's shared care percentage of the FTB child rate that would otherwise apply to the child.

#### Division 5--Maintenance income test

##### Subdivision A--Maintenance income test

##### 19A  Extended meaning of receiving maintenance income

    * In this Division, if the FTB child of an individual receives maintenance income, the individual is taken to have received the maintenance income.

##### 19AA  References to applying for maintenance income

    * A reference in this Division to an individual being, or not being, entitled to apply for maintenance income includes an individual who is, or is not, entitled to so apply under the _Child Support (Assessment) Act 1989_ or the _Family Law Act 1975_.

##### 19B  Application of maintenance income test to certain pension and benefit recipients and their partners

    * If the individual, or the individual's partner, is:

     * (a) permanently blind; and 

     * (b) receiving:

      * (i) an age pension (under Part 2.2 of the _Social Security Act 1991_); or

      * (ii) a disability support pension (under Part 2.3 of the _Social Security Act 1991_); or

      * (iii) a service pension; or

      * (iv) income support supplement (under Part IIIA of the _Veterans' Entitlements Act 1986_);

    * then: 

     * (c) the individual's maintenance income excess is nil; and

     * (d) the individual's income and maintenance tested rate is the same as the individual's income tested rate.

##### 20  Effect of maintenance income on family tax benefit rate

    * (1) This is how to work out an individual's reduction for maintenance income if clause 19B does not apply:

Method statement

      * Step 1.	Work out the annualised amount of the individual's **_maintenance income_**. In doing so:

        * (a) disregard any maintenance income for an FTB child for whom the FTB child rate under clause 7 does not exceed the base FTB child rate (see clause 8); and

        * (b) disregard the operation of clause 11 (sharing of family tax benefit) in applying paragraph (a); and

        * (c) disregard any amount that, for the income year for which the individual's reduction for maintenance income is being worked out, is required under clause 24E to be depleted from a maintenance income credit balance of the individual and, if the individual is a member of a couple, from a maintenance income credit balance of the individual's partner; and

        * (d) disregard any maintenance income that is received by the individual, or the individual's partner, from another individual if the income is over the maintenance income ceiling for the income (see Subdivisions C and D).

      * Step 2.	Work out the individual's **_maintenance income free area _**using clauses 22 and 23.

      * Step 3.	Work out whether the individual's maintenance income exceeds the individual's maintenance income free area.

      * Step 4.	If the individual's maintenance income does not exceed the individual's maintenance income free area, the individual's **_maintenance income excess _**is nil and there is no reduction for maintenance income.

      * Step 5.	If the individual's maintenance income exceeds the individual's maintenance income free area, the individual's **_maintenance income excess _**is the individual's maintenance income less the individual's maintenance income free area.

      * Step 6.	The individual's **_reduction for maintenance income_** is half the maintenance income excess.

    * (2) Paragraph (c) of step 1 of the method statement in subclause (1) does not apply unless and until the individual has satisfied the FTB reconciliation conditions in section 32B of the Family Assistance Administration Act for all of the samerate benefit periods (within the meaning of that section) that are included in the income year for which the individual's reduction for maintenance income is being worked out.

##### 20A  Annualised amount of maintenance income

    * Object of clause

    * (1) The object of this clause is to annualise the maintenance income (other than capitalised maintenance income) (**_CMI_**) of an individual during an income year.

    * Annualisation of maintenance income other than CMI

    * (2) If an individual receives maintenance income (other than CMI) from another individual during any period or periods (the **_relevant period or periods_**) in an income year, the annualised amount of the maintenance income of the individual is worked out using the following formula:

    * Commencement of relevant period

    * (3) If:

     * (a) an individual (**_payee_**) receives maintenance income (other than CMI) from another individual (**_payer_**) in an income year under a maintenance liability; and

     * (b) subsection (4) does not apply;

    * the relevant period in respect of the maintenance income commences: 

     * (c) in the case where the maintenance liability arises after 1 July of the income year in which the maintenance income is received--on the day that the maintenance liability arises; or

     * (d) in the case where the maintenance liability exists on 1 July of the income year in which the maintenance income is received--1 July.

    * (4) If:

     * (a) a payee receives maintenance income (other than CMI) from a payer in an income year under a maintenance liability; and

     * (b) the payee has received maintenance income (other than CMI) from that payer previously during a period in the income year, but not under a maintenance liability; and

     * (c) in between the time the payee receives maintenance income under paragraph (a) and the end of the period referred to in paragraph (b):

      * (i) the payee and the payer were not members of the same couple; and

      * (ii) the payee was entitled to claim, or apply for, maintenance from the payer;

    * the relevant period in respect of the maintenance income commences: 

     * (d) on the day the payee first received the previously received maintenance income in the income year; or

     * (e) on such earlier day in respect of the previously received maintenance income that the Secretary determines.

    * (5) If a payee receives maintenance income (other than CMI) from a payer during a period in an income year but not under a maintenance liability, the relevant period, in respect of the maintenance income, commences:

     * (a) on the day that the payee first received the maintenance income during that period; or

     * (b) on such earlier day that the Secretary determines.

    * End of relevant period

    * (6) A relevant period, in respect of maintenance income (other than CMI) received under a maintenance liability in an income year, ends either when the maintenance liability ceases (if it ceases before the end of the income year) or on 30 June of the income year.

    * (7) If:

     * (a) a payee receives maintenance income (other than CMI) in an income year; and

     * (b) the maintenance income is not received under a maintenance liability; 

    * the relevant period ends in respect of the payee either: 

     * (c) unless subclause (8) applies--when the payee ceases to receive the maintenance income (if the payee ceases to receive the income before the end of the income year); or

     * (d) on 30 June of the income year.

    * (8) If:

     * (a) a payee receives maintenance income (other than CMI) from a payer in an income year under a maintenance liability; and

     * (b) the payee has received maintenance income (other than CMI) from that payer previously during a period in the income year, but not under a maintenance liability; and

     * (c) in between the time the payee receives maintenance income under paragraph (a) and the end of the period referred to in paragraph (b):

      * (i) the payee and the payer were not members of the same couple; and

      * (ii) the payee was entitled to claim, or apply for, maintenance from the payer;

    * the relevant period ends either when the maintenance liability ceases (if it ceases before the end of the income year) or on 30 June of the income year.

    * Relevant period where payee elects to end an assessment

    * (9) If:

     * (a) a payee receives maintenance income (other than CMI) in an income year from a payer under a maintenance liability which is an assessment under Part 5 of the _Child Support (Assessment) Act 1989_; and

     * (b) the payee and payer become members of the same couple; and

     * (c) the payee elects under the _Child Support (Assessment) Act 1989 _to end the assessment from a specified day before the day the payee and payer became members of the same couple;

    * for the purpose of determining the commencement or end of the relevant period, the assessment is taken to end from the day the payee and the payer became a member of the same couple or from such earlier day as the Secretary determines (not being a day earlier than the specified day).

    * Meaning of **maintenance liability**

    * **	(10)	In this clause, **_maintenance liability _**means a liability to provide:

     * (a) child support; or

     * (b) maintenance (other than child support) that arises as a result of:

      * (i) the order of a court; or

      * (ii) a maintenance agreement (within the meaning of the _Family Law Act 1975_) that has been registered in, or approved by, a court in Australia or an external Territory; or

      * (iii) a financial agreement, or Part VIIIAB financial agreement, within the meaning of that Act; or

      * (iv) any other agreement with respect to the maintenance of a person that has been registered in, or approved by, a court in Australia or an external Territory.

    * Day a maintenance liability arises

    * (11) The day a maintenance liability arises is:

     * (a) if the liability is to provide child support, the day that the liability arises under the _Child Support (Assessment) Act 1989_; or

     * (b) if the liability is to provide maintenance that arises as set out in paragraph (10)(b), the day that the order of the court or the agreement has effect from.

##### 20B  Working out amounts of child maintenance using notional assessments

    * (1) If:

     * (a) an individual receives child maintenance for an FTB child of the individual under a child support agreement or court order; and

     * (b) there is, in relation to the agreement or order, a notional assessment of the annual rate of child support that would be payable to the individual for the child for a particular day in a child support period if that annual rate were payable under Part 5 of the _Child Support (Assessment) Act 1989 _instead of under the agreement or order;

    * then the amount of child maintenance that the individual is taken to have received in an income year under the agreement or order for the child for a period is worked out in accordance with this clause.

        * Note: The amount worked out in accordance with this clause is annualised under clause 20A.

    * Individual taken to have received notional assessed amount

    * (2) For the purposes of this Act, the amount of child maintenance that the individual is taken to have received under the agreement or order for the child for the period is, subject to this clause, the amount (the **_notional assessed amount_**) that the individual would have received if the individual had received the annual rate of child support for the child for the period that is included in the notional assessment, disregarding so much of that rate as is attributable to the individual receiving disability expenses maintenance.

    * Underpayments

    * (3) If the amount received in an income year by the individual under the agreement or order for the child for the period is less than the amount that is payable to the individual under the agreement or order for the child for the period (such that a debt arises for the period under the agreement or order), then, for the purposes of this Act, the amount of child maintenance that the individual is taken to have received under the agreement or order for the child for the period is the following amount (the **_notional amount paid_**):

        * Note: This subclause only applies in respect of enforceable maintenance liabilities (see subclause (7)).

    * Underpayments--nonperiodic payments and lump sum payments

    * (3A) For the purposes of the formula in subclause (3), the amount received by the individual under the agreement or order, for the child for the period, is taken to include:

     * (a) if the agreement or order is a nonperiodic payments agreement or order--the amount by which the annual rate of child support payable for the child is reduced for the period under the agreement or order; and

     * (b) if the agreement or order is a lump sum payments agreement or order--the total amount of the lump sum payment that is credited for each day in the period under section 69A of the _Child Support (Registration and Collection) Act 1988_ against the amount payable under the liability under the agreement or order.

    * (3B) If the agreement or order is a nonperiodic payments agreement or order, for the purposes of the formula in subclause (3), the amount payable to the individual under the agreement or order for the child for the period is taken to include the amount by which the annual rate of child support payable for the child is reduced for the period under the agreement or order.

    * Arrears

    * (4) If the amount received in an income year by the individual under the agreement or order for the child for the period exceeds the amount that is payable to the individual under the agreement or order for the child for the period, then, for the purposes of this Act, the amount of child maintenance that the individual is taken to have received under the agreement or order for the child for the period is:

        * Note: This subclause only applies in respect of enforceable maintenance liabilities (see subclause (7)).

    * (5) The **_notional arrears amount_**, in respect of a debt arising for a previous period under the agreement or order, is:

    * (6) For the purposes of subclause (5), if:

     * (a) an individual has more than one debt that arose under an agreement or order for previous periods; and

     * (b) the amount received in an income year by the individual under the agreement or order for a child for a period exceeds the amount that is payable to the individual under the agreement or order for the child for the period;

    * then: 

     * (c) the individual is taken to have received the excess to pay off each debt in the order in which the debts arose; and

     * (d) each debt is reduced by the amount of the debt that is paid off.

    * (7) Subclauses (3) and (4) only apply in respect of enforceable maintenance liabilities (within the meaning of the _Child Support (Registration and Collection) Act 1988_).

    * (8) In this clause:

    * **_lump sum payments agreement or order_** means:

     * (a) an agreement containing lump sum payment provisions (within the meaning of the _Child Support (Assessment) Act 1989_); or

     * (b) a court order made under section 123A of that Act.

    * **_nonperiodic payments agreement or order_** means:

     * (a) an agreement containing nonperiodic payment provisions (within the meaning of the _Child Support (Assessment) Act 1989_); or

     * (b) a court order made under section 124 of that Act that includes a statement made under section 125 of that Act that the annual rate of child support payable by a liable parent under an administrative assessment is to be reduced.

##### 20C  Working out amounts of child maintenance in relation to lump sum payments

    * (1) This clause applies if an individual receives in an income year child maintenance for an FTB child of the individual under:

     * (a) a child support agreement, containing lump sum payment provisions (within the meaning of paragraph 84(1)(e) of the _Child Support (Assessment) Act 1989_), to which clause 20B does not apply; or

     * (b) a court order made under section 123A of that Act;

    * in the form of a lump sum payment that is to be credited under section 69A of the _Child Support (Registration and Collection) Act 1988 _against the amount payable under a liability under an administrative assessment.

    * (2) For the purposes of this Act, the amount of child maintenance that the individual is taken to have received in an income year under the agreement or order for the child for a period is the amount that is credited under section 69A of the _Child Support (Registration and Collection) Act 1988_ against the amount payable under the liability under the administrative assessment for the child for the period.

        * Note: The amount worked out under this clause is annualised under clause 20A.

    * (3) Subclause (2) does not apply in relation to the individual and the child for a period if subclause 20B(2), (3) or (4) or 20D(2) has applied in relation to the individual and the child for that period.

##### 20D  Working out amounts of child maintenance for administrative assessments privately collected

    * (1) This clause applies if, during a period in an income year:

     * (a) an individual is entitled to receive an amount of child maintenance for an FTB child of the individual under a liability under an administrative assessment (within the meaning of the _Child Support (Assessment) Act 1989_); and

     * (b) the liability is not an enforceable maintenance liability (within the meaning of the _Child Support (Registration and Collection) Act 1988_); and

     * (c) the child maintenance is not maintenance to which clause 20B applies; and

     * (d) the Secretary considers that it is reasonable for the individual to take action to obtain the amount.

    * Individual taken to have received full entitlement

    * (2) For the purposes of this Act, the individual is taken to have received, for the period in the income year, the amount of child maintenance for the child that the individual is entitled to receive under the liability, disregarding so much of that amount as is attributable to the individual receiving disability expenses maintenance.

##### 21  Maintenance income of members of couple to be added

    * The annualised amount of the maintenance income of an individual who is a member of a couple is the sum of the amounts that, apart from this clause, would be the respective annualised amounts of each of the members of the couple.

##### 22  How to calculate an individual's maintenance income free area

    * An individual's **_maintenance income free area_** is worked out using the following table. Work out which family situation in the table applies to the individual. The maintenance income free area is the corresponding amount in column 2 plus an additional corresponding amount in column 3 for each FTB child after the first, disregarding any child:

     * (a) for whom maintenance income is disregarded under paragraph (a) of step 1 of the method statement in clause 20; or

     * (b) in respect of whom neither the individual, nor the individual's partner, is entitled to apply for maintenance income.

##### 23  Only maintenance actually received taken into account in applying clause 22

    * In determining whether or not item 2 or 3 of the table in clause 22 applies to an individual, clause 21 is to be disregarded. This has the effect of taking into account only maintenance income that the individual actually receives rather than any maintenance income that the individual is taken to receive because of maintenance income received by the individual's partner.

##### 24  Apportionment of capitalised maintenance income

    * (1) The object of this clause is to spread capitalised maintenance income so that it is taken into account over the whole of the period in respect of which it is received.

    * (2) If an individual receives capitalised maintenance income, the maintenance income of the individual that is attributable to the capitalised maintenance income during any period (the **_relevant period_**) in the capitalisation period is the amount worked out using the formula:

    * (2A) For the capitalisation period in an income year, the annualised amount of an individual's capitalised maintenance income is worked out using the following formula:

    * Capitalisation period--court order or agreement

    * (3) If:

     * (a) the capitalised maintenance income is received under or as a result of:

      * (i) the order of a court; or

      * (ii) a maintenance agreement (within the meaning of the _Family Law Act 1975_) that has been registered in, or approved by, a court in Australia or an external Territory; or

      * (iii) a financial agreement, or Part VIIIAB financial agreement, within the meaning of that Act; or

      * (iv) any other agreement with respect to the maintenance of a person that has been registered in, or approved by, a court in Australia or an external Territory; and

     * (b) the order or agreement specified the period in relation to which the capitalised maintenance income was to be provided; and

     * (c) the length of the period could be ascertained with reasonable certainty when the order was made or the agreement was so registered or approved;

    * the **_capitalisation period_** is, subject to subclause (6), the period specified in the order or agreement.

    * Capitalisation period--FTB child under 18

    * (4) If:

     * (a) the capitalised maintenance income relates to the maintenance of an FTB child of the individual; and

     * (b) the child has not turned 18 on the day on which the income is received; and

     * (c) subclause (3) does not apply to the capitalised maintenance income;

    * the **_capitalisation period_** is, subject to subclause (6), the period that starts on the day on which the income is received and ends on the day immediately before the day on which the child turns 18.

    * Capitalisation period--partner under 65

    * (5) If:

     * (a) the capitalised maintenance income relates to the maintenance of the individual by the individual's partner or former partner; and

     * (b) the individual has not turned 65 on the day on which the income is received; and

     * (c) subclause (3) does not apply to the capitalised maintenance income;

    * the **_capitalisation period _**is, subject to subclause (6), the period that starts on the day on which the income is received and ends on the day immediately before the day on which the individual turns 65.

    * Capitalisation period--other cases

    * (6) If:

     * (a) the Secretary considers:

      * (i) in a case falling within subclause (3) where the period referred to in that subclause was specified in an order of a court that was made by consent or in an agreement referred to in subparagraph (3)(a)(ii), (iii) or (iv)--that the period is not appropriate in the circumstances of the case; or

      * (ii) in a case falling within subclause (4) or (5)--that the period referred to in that subclause is not appropriate in the circumstances of the case; or

     * (b) no capitalisation period is applicable in relation to the capitalised maintenance income under subclause (3), (4) or (5);

    * the **_capitalisation period_** is such period as the Secretary considers appropriate in the circumstances of the case.

##### Subdivision B--Maintenance income credit balances

##### 24A  Maintenance income credit balances

    * (1) A **_maintenance income credit balance_**, for a registered entitlement of an individual, is, at any particular time, the balance at that time of the accruals under clause 24B and the depletions under clause 24E in relation to that entitlement.

    * (2) Despite subclause (1), a maintenance income credit balance for a registered entitlement, at the end of an income year, cannot exceed the total arrears owing from that registered entitlement, at that time, for all income years for which the entitlement has existed.

    * (3) If:

     * (a) but for the condition in subclause 24B(3) not being met in relation to an income year, there would be an accrual to a maintenance income credit balance of an individual for a day in that income year; and

     * (b) after there has been an accrual under clause 24C for a day in a later income year or a depletion under clause 24E for a later income year, that condition is met in relation to the earlier income year;

    * the maintenance income credit balance is recalculated, taking into account the accrual for the day in the earlier income year before taking into account the accrual or depletion mentioned in paragraph (b).

    * (4) This Subdivision continues to apply in relation to a maintenance income credit balance of an individual whether or not the individual or the individual's partner continues to be eligible for family tax benefit.

##### 24B  Accruals to a maintenance income credit balance

    * Accrual if conditions are satisfied

    * (1) There is an accrual to a maintenance income credit balance for a registered entitlement of an individual, for a day in an income year, of the amount worked out under clause 24C for that day, if all the conditions in this clause are satisfied.

    * Conditions that must be satisfied

    * (2) Either or both of the following must apply:

     * (a) the individual is eligible for family tax benefit for the day;

     * (b) if the individual is a member of a couple on the day--the individual's partner is eligible for family tax benefit for the day.

    * (3) The eligible person must have satisfied the FTB reconciliation conditions in section 32B of the Family Assistance Administration Act for all of the samerate benefit periods (within the meaning of that section) that are included in the income year.

    * (4) The annualised amount of the maintenance income of the eligible person for the day must be less than the maintenance income free area that applied to the eligible person for that day.

    * (5) The maintenance income that the individual received in the income year from the registered entitlement must be less than the amount due in the income year from the registered entitlement.

##### 24C  Amount of accrual to a maintenance income credit balance

    * (1) This is how to work out the amount of the accrual under clause 24B, for a day in an income year, to a maintenance income credit balance for a registered entitlement of an individual who is, or is the partner of, an eligible person under subclause 24B(2):

Method statement

      * Step 1.	Work out the global maintenance entitlement of the eligible person for the day using clause 24D.

      * Step 2.	Identify the lower of:

        * (a) that global maintenance entitlement; and

        * (b) the maintenance income free area that applied to the eligible person for the day.

      * Step 3.	Subtract from the lower amount identified in step 2 the annualised amount of the maintenance income of the eligible person for the day.

      * Step 4.	Divide the result of step 3 by 365 and round the result of the division to the nearest cent (rounding 0.5 cents upwards).

      * Step 5.	Unless subclause (2) applies to the individual, the amount that accrues to the maintenance income credit balance of the individual for the day is the amount worked out under step 4.

      * If subclause (2) applies to the individual, take the amount worked out under step 4 and apply the method statement in subclause (2).

    * (2) If either or both of the following apply:

     * (a) the individual has more than one registered entitlement for the day in respect of which the condition in subclause 24B(5) is met;

     * (b) if the individual is a member of a couple on the day--the individual's partner has one or more registered entitlements for the day in respect of which the condition in subclause 24B(5) is met;

    * this is how to work out the amount of the accrual under clause 24B, for a day in an income year, to each of the maintenance income credit balances (the **_relevant balances_**) for those entitlements:

Method statement

      * Step 1.	Work out the **_daily cap_** for each relevant balance as follows:

        * (a) work out the annualised amount mentioned in paragraph 24D(1)(a) that is due in the income year from the registered entitlement to which the balance relates, and any related private collection entitlement;

        * (b) work out under subclause (4) the annualised amount of maintenance income received in the income year from that registered entitlement, and any related private collection entitlement;

        * (c) the daily cap is the excess of the amount mentioned in paragraph (a) over the amount mentioned in paragraph (b), divided by 365 and rounded to the nearest cent (rounding 0.5 cents upwards).

      * Step 2.	Distribute the amount worked out under step 4 of the method statement in subclause (1) equally among each relevant balance, up to the amount of the daily cap for the relevant balance.

      * Step 3.	Distribute any remaining amount equally among each relevant balance for which the daily cap has not been reached, up to the amount of the daily cap for the relevant balance.

      * Step 4.	Reapply step 3 to any remaining amount until:

        * (a) there is no remaining amount to distribute; or

        * (b) the daily cap for each relevant balance is reached.

      * Step 5.	The amount that accrues to each of the relevant balances for the day is the sum of the amount distributed under step 2 and any additional amounts distributed under steps 3 and 4, with that sum rounded to the nearest cent (rounding 0.5 cents upwards).

    * (3) To avoid doubt, clauses 24B and 24C apply only once for a day in relation to any relevant balance.

    * (4) For the purposes of step 1 of the method statement in subclause (2), the **_annualised amount of maintenance income _**received in an income year from a registered entitlement, and any related private collection entitlement, of an individual (or an individual's partner) is the amount worked out by using this formula:

    * (5) In this clause:

    * **_related private collection entitlement_**, in relation to a registered entitlement, has the same meaning as in clause 24D.

##### 24D  Global maintenance entitlement of an eligible person

    * (1) For the purposes of step 1 of the method statement in subclause 24C(1), the **_global maintenance entitlement _**of the eligible person under subclause 24B(2) for the day is the sum of:

     * (a) the annualised amounts worked out using the formula in subclause (2) for:

      * (i) each registered entitlement for the day, and any related private collection entitlement, of the eligible person; and

      * (ii) if the eligible person is a member of a couple on the day--each registered entitlement for the day, and any related private collection entitlement, of the eligible person's partner; and

     * (b) any amounts worked out under subclause (3); and

     * (c) the annualised amount of any capitalised maintenance income of the eligible person and, if the eligible person is a member of a couple on the day, of the eligible person's partner, for the day; and

     * (d) the annualised amount of any maintenance income of the eligible person and, if the eligible person is a member of a couple on the day, of the eligible person's partner, for the day:

      * (i) that is not from a registered entitlement; and

      * (ii) that is not capitalised maintenance income.

    * (2) For the purposes of paragraph (1)(a), the formula is:

    * (3) If:

     * (a) in respect of:

      * (i) a registered entitlement for the day, and any related private collection entitlement, of the eligible person; or

      * (ii) if the eligible person is a member of a couple on the day--a registered entitlement for the day, and any related private collection entitlement, of the eligible person's partner;

     * the maintenance income received by the eligible person or partner for the income year exceeds the amount due in the income year from the registered entitlement, and any related private collection entitlement; and

     * (b) that excess, or any part of it (the **_relevant excess_**), is not disregarded for the purposes of paragraph (c) of step 1 of the method statement in clause 20;

    * an amount for the purposes of paragraph (1)(b) is worked out by using this formula:

    * (4) For the purposes of this clause, an individual's private collection entitlement is **_related _**to the individual's registered entitlement if the private collection entitlement and registered entitlement relate to the same registrable maintenance liability, within the meaning of the _Child Support (Registration and Collection) Act 1988_.

    * (5) In this clause:

    * **_private collection entitlement_**, of an individual, means the individual's entitlement to receive maintenance income from a particular payer, if the payer's liability to pay that maintenance income is a registrable maintenance liability that is not an enforceable maintenance liability, within the meaning of the _Child Support (Registration and Collection) Act 1988_.

##### 24E  Depletions from a maintenance income credit balance

    * (1) There is a depletion from the maintenance income credit balance for a registered entitlement of an individual, for an income year, of the amount worked out under subclause (2), if:

     * (a) the income year has ended; and

     * (b) the maintenance income that the individual received in the income year from the entitlement is more than the amount due in the income year from the entitlement.

    * (2) The amount by which the maintenance income credit balance is depleted is the lower of:

     * (a) the excess of the maintenance income that the individual received in the income year from the entitlement over the amount due in the income year from the entitlement; and

     * (b) the amount of the maintenance income credit balance.

    * (3) For the purposes of paragraphs (1)(b) and (2)(a), in working out the maintenance income received in an income year or the amount of maintenance income due in an income year:

     * (a) disregard any maintenance income received or due for an FTB child for whom the FTB child rate under clause 7 does not exceed the base FTB child rate (see clause 8); and

     * (b) disregard the operation of clause 11 (sharing of family tax benefit) in applying paragraph (a).

##### 24EA  Amounts due under notional assessments

    * (1) This clause applies if:

     * (a) an individual receives child maintenance for an FTB child of the individual under a child support agreement or court order; and

     * (b) there is, in relation to the agreement or order, a notional assessment of the annual rate of child support that would be payable to the individual for the child for a particular day in a child support period if that annual rate were payable under Part 5 of the _Child Support (Assessment) Act 1989 _instead of under the agreement or order; and

     * (c) the child maintenance is received, wholly or in part, from a registered entitlement.

    * (2) For the purposes of this Subdivision, the amount of child maintenance that is taken to be due to the individual under the agreement or order (whether from the registered entitlement or from a related private collection entitlement within the meaning of clause 24D), for the child for a period, is the amount that would have been due if the amount due to the individual had been the annual rate of child support for the child for the period that is included in the notional assessment.

    * (3) To avoid doubt, subclause (2) does not apply in relation to the total arrears owing from a registered entitlement, as mentioned in subclause 24A(2).

##### Subdivision C--Maintenance income ceiling for Method 1

##### 24F  Subdivision not always to apply

    * This Subdivision does not apply to an individual if:

#### Division 1--Overall rate calculation process

##### 25  Method of calculating Part A rate

    * Subject to the operation of clause 25A, if the individual's Part A rate is to be calculated using this Part, it is calculated as follows: 

Method statement

      * Step 1.	Add the following amounts:

        * (a) the individual's standard rate under Division 2 of this Part (clauses 26 and 27);

        * (b) the individual's large family supplement (if any) under Division 1 of Part 5 (clauses 34 and 35);

        * (e) the individual's energy supplement (Part A) under Subdivision B of Division 2AA of Part 5 (clause 38AF).

      * The result is the individual's**_ Method 2 base rate_**.

      * Step 2.	Apply the income test in Division 3 of this Part (clause 28) to work out any reduction for adjusted taxable income. Take any reduction away from the individual's Method 2 base rate: the result is the individual's **_provisional Part A rate_**.

      * Step 3.	Work out the rate that would be the individual's income and maintenance tested rate under step 3 of the method statement in clause 3 if the individual's Part A rate were to be calculated using Part 2 (but disregarding clause 24G): the result is the individual's **_Method 2 income and maintenance tested rate_**.

      * Step 4.	The individual's **_Part A rate_** is:

        * (a) the individual's provisional Part A rate if it is equal to or greater than the individual's Method 2 income and maintenance tested rate; or

        * (b) the individual's Method 2 income and maintenance tested rate if it is greater than the individual's provisional Part A rate.

##### 25A  Family tax benefit advance to individual

##### 27  Sharing family tax benefit (shared care percentages)

    * If an individual has a shared care percentage for an FTB child of the individual, the FTB child rate for the child, in working out the individual's standard rate under clause 26, is the individual's shared care percentage of the FTB child rate that would otherwise apply to the child.

#### Division 3--Income test

##### 28  Income test

    * This is how to work out an individual's reduction for adjusted taxable income:

Method statement

      * Step 2.	Work out whether the individual's adjusted taxable income exceeds the individual's higher income free area.

      * Step 3.	If the individual's adjusted taxable income does not exceed the individual's higher income free area, the individual's **_income excess _**is nil.

      * Step 4.	If the individual's adjusted taxable income exceeds the individual's higher income free area, the individual's **_income excess _**is the individual's adjusted taxable income less the individual's higher income free area.

      * Step 5.	The individual's **_reduction for income _**is 30% of the income excess.

### Part 3A--Part A rate (Method 3)

##### 28A  Method of calculating Part A rate

    * Subject to the operation of clauses 38J and 38K, if the individual's Part A rate is to be calculated using this Part, it is calculated as follows:

Method statement

      * Step 1.	Work out the individual's rent assistance (if any) under Subdivision A of Division 2B of Part 5 (clauses 38B to 38H). The result is the individual's **_maximum rate_**.

      * Step 2.	Apply the income test in Division 2C of Part 5 (clauses 38L to 38N) to work out any reduction for adjusted taxable income. Take any reduction away from the individual's maximum rate: the result is the individual's **_income tested rate_**.

      * Step 3.	The individual's **_Part A rate _**is the individual's income tested rate.

### Part 4--Part B rate

#### Division 1--Overall rate calculation process

##### Subdivision AA--When Part B rate is nil

##### 28B  Adjusted taxable income exceeding $150,000

    * (1) Despite Subdivisions A and B, an individual's Part B rate is nil if the individual's adjusted taxable income is more than $150,000.

        * Note: If the individual is a member of a couple, the individual's adjusted taxable income is the higher of the individual's adjusted taxable income and the adjusted taxable income of the individual's partner: see clause 3 of Schedule 3.

    * (2) However, subclause (1) does not apply while the individual, or the individual's partner, is receiving a social security pension, a social security benefit, a service pension or income support supplement.

##### 28C  Paid parental leave

    * Despite Subdivisions A and B, the Part B rate that an individual is eligible for in respect of a day is nil if the day occurs during a PPL period applying to the individual, or the individual's partner.

##### Subdivision A--General method of calculating Part B rate

##### 29  General method of calculating Part B rate

    * (1) The individual's Part B rate is the amount worked out by adding the following amounts if the individual is not a member of a couple:

     * (a) the individual's standard rate under Division 2 (clauses 30 and 31);

     * (b) the individual's FTB Part B supplement under Division 2A (clause 31A);

     * (c) the individual's energy supplement (Part B) under Division 2B (clause 31B).

    * (2) The individual's Part B rate is worked out using the following method statement if the individual is a member of a couple:

Method statement

      * Step 1.	Add the following amounts:

        * (a) the individual's standard rate under Division 2 (clauses 30 and 31);

        * (b) the individual's FTB Part B supplement under Division 2A (clause 31A);

        * (c) the individual's energy supplement (Part B) under Division 2B (clause 31B).

      * The result is the individual's **_maximum rate_**.

      * Step 2.	Work out the individual's **_reduction for adjusted taxable income_** using Division 3 (clauses 32 and 33).

      * Step 3.	The individual's Part B rate is the maximum rate less the reduction for adjusted taxable income.

        * Note: An individual who is a member of a couple works out his or her Part B rate under Subdivision B if the secondary earner of the couple returns to paid work after the birth of a child etc.

    * (2A) The Minister may, by legislative instrument, determine a method for working out the extent to which Part B rates under subclause (2) are attributable to the amounts referred to in step 1 of the method statement in subclause (2).

    * (3) In applying this Part to an individual, disregard an FTB child who has turned 16 years of age unless the FTB child is a senior secondary school child.

    * (4) Later during that income year, the secondary earner returns to paid work for the first time since a child became an FTB child of the secondary earner.

    * (4A) If, in different income years, more than one secondary earner returns to paid work for the first time in respect of the same child, the Part B rate of the individual is not calculated under this clause in respect of a return to paid work that is not the earliest return to paid work.

    * (4B) If, in the same income year, more than one secondary earner returns to paid work for the first time in respect of the same child, the Part B rate of the individual is not calculated under this clause in respect of a secondary earner for whom the period mentioned under paragraph 29C(1)(a) does not begin first.

     * (a) at some time during the income year, the other individual is the partner of:

      * (i) the secondary earner; or

      * (ii) the individual mentioned in subclause 29A(1) (if he or she is not the secondary earner); and

     * (b) the other individual's Part B rate has been calculated under clause 29A in respect of the same return to paid work, and the same FTB child, of the secondary earner.

        * Note: For the definition of **_eligible partner_** see subclause (5).

    * Part A rate to be reduced

    * (2) The individual's Part A rate for that day (as calculated or recalculated because of the making of the family assistance decision) is to be reduced:

     * (a) first, by the individual's annual social security RA amount for that day (see subclause (3)); and

      * Step 2.	If the individual or the individual's partner was receiving family tax payment, but not family allowance, immediately before 1 July 2000, the individual's or partner's fortnightly Part A rate of family tax payment immediately before 1 July 2000 is the individual's **_fortnightly rate_**.

      * Step 3.	If the individual or the individual's partner was receiving family allowance and family tax payment immediately before 1 July 2000, add the following amounts:

        * (a) the individual's or partner's fortnightly rate of family allowance immediately before 1 July 2000;

From the individual's fortnightly rate subtract any amount of guardian allowance included in the individual's or the individual's partner's family allowance by virtue of Module F of the Family Allowance Rate Calculator in section 1069 of the _Social Security Act 1991_, as in force immediately before 1 July 2000: the result is the individual's **_net fortnightly rate_**.

      * Step 5.	Divide the individual's net fortnightly rate by 14. If the result is not a whole number of cents or dollars or a whole number of dollars and a whole number of cents, round the result upwards to the nearest cent and multiply the rounded amount by 365: the result of the multiplication is the individual's **_annual rate_**.

      * Step 6.	If neither the individual nor the individual's partner was receiving family allowance or family tax payment immediately before 1 July 2000, the individual's **_annual rate_** is nil.

      * Step 7.	If either or both of subparagraphs (2)(a)(i) and (ii) are satisfied but subparagraph (2)(a)(iii) is not satisfied, the individual's annual rate is his or her **_30 June 2000 rate_**.

      * Step 8.	If subparagraph (2)(a)(iii) is satisfied but subparagraph (2)(a)(ii) is not satisfied, add the following amounts:

        * (a) the individual's annual rate;

        * (b) the individual's 19992000 family tax assistance component.

      * The result is the individual's **_30 June 2000 rate_**.

     * (b) as if neither the individual nor the individual's partner was receiving a pension referred to in paragraph (2)(b).

    * (8) An individual's 19992000 family tax assistance component is the amount worked out according to the formula:

    * where:

     * (b) the sum of the amounts by which the individual's Part A rate would be reduced under clause 5 or 25A to repay the unrepaid advances would exceed the amount of the individual's Part A rate before reduction (the **_unreduced Part A rate_**), if the amounts were worked out under clause 40.

    * (2) Subject to clause 45, the amount by which the individual's Part A rate is to be reduced under clause 5 or 25A to repay the unrepaid advances is worked out using the following method statement:

Method statement

      * Step 1.	Take each advance, in the order in which the advances were paid.

      * Step 2.	If the unreduced Part A rate, less any amounts by which the individual's Part A rate has been reduced under a previous application of this step, equals or exceeds the standard reduction for the advance, the individual's Part A rate is to be reduced by an amount equal to the standard reduction.

      * Step 3.	If the unreduced Part A rate, less any amounts by which the individual's Part A rate has been reduced under a previous application of step 2, does not equal or exceed the standard reduction for the advance (but is greater than nil), the Secretary must determine that the number of days in the repayment period for the advance is to be increased so that the individual's Part A rate is reduced by an amount that is no more than the remainder.

      * Step 4.	If the unreduced Part A rate, less any amounts by which the individual's Part A rate has been reduced under a previous application of step 2 or step 3, is nil, the Secretary must determine that the repayment period for the advance is to be suspended while the determination is in force.

    * (3) The Secretary may vary a determination made under step 3 of the method statement in subclause (2).

    * (4) The Secretary may revoke a determination made under step 4 of the method statement in subclause (2).

    * (5) Subject to clause 45, if the Secretary revokes a determination made under step 4 of the method statement in subclause (2) in relation to a family tax benefit advance, the Secretary must determine the number of days remaining in the repayment period for the advance.

    * (6) The Secretary must not vary a determination under subclause (3), or make a determination under subclause (5), in relation to a family tax benefit advance so that the amount by which the individual's Part A rate is to be reduced under clause 5 or 25A to repay the advance is more than the standard reduction.

##### 45  Part A rate insufficient to cover reduction--discretion to create FTB advance debt

    * (1) The Secretary may, instead of making a determination under subclause 43(2), step 3 of the method statement in subclause 44(2) or under subclause 44(5), determine that the amount of unrepaid family tax benefit advance is to be a debt.

        * Note: See subsection 71A(7) of the Family Assistance Administration Act.

    * (2) However, the Secretary must not make a determination under subclause (1) unless the individual's Part A rate before reduction under clause 5 or 25A is less than the amount that would, under clause 26, be the FTB child rate if:

     * (a) the individual's Part A rate were required to be worked out using Part 3 of this Schedule; and

     * (b) clause 27 did not apply.

    * Request for variation of the determination

    * (3) On the request of the individual, the Secretary may, in writing, vary the determination so as to increase the number of days in the repayment period.

    * (4) However, the Secretary must not vary the determination under subclause (3) if, as a result of the variation, the amount by which the individual's Part A rate is to be reduced under clause 5 or 25A would be less than the standard reduction.

        * Note: If, after a variation under subclause (3), the reduction in the individual's Part A rate under clause 5 or 25A would cause the individual to suffer severe financial hardship, the individual may request a longer repayment period under clause 47.

##### 47  Changing the repayment period--individual requests longer period

    * Request for longer repayment period

    * (1) The Secretary may determine that the number of days in a repayment period for a family tax benefit advance paid to an individual is to be increased if:

     * (a) the individual has made a request in accordance with subclause (2) for a longer repayment period; and

     * (b) the Secretary is satisfied that:

      * (i) special circumstances relevant to the repayment of the advance exist in relation to the individual that could not reasonably have been foreseen at the time of the individual's request for a family tax benefit advance; and

     * (b) the amount by which the individual's Part A rate is to be reduced under clause 5 or 25A, as a result of the variation, is not greater than the standard reduction.

##### 48  Changing the repayment period--recalculation of amount of unrepaid family tax benefit advance

    * (1) This clause applies if, during the repayment period for a family tax benefit advance, the amount of the family tax benefit advance that is unrepaid is increased, due to a variation in a determination, or a variation or substitution of a decision on review (other than a variation under subsection 28(2) or (6) of the Family Assistance Administration Act), so that the amount by which the individual's Part A rate is to be reduced under clause 5 or 25A is an amount that is more than the standard reduction.

    * (2) The Secretary must determine that the number of days in a repayment period is to be increased so that the amount by which the individual's Part A rate is to be reduced under clause 5 or 25A is an amount that is no more than the standard reduction.

        * Note: The individual may also request that the Secretary determine a shorter or longer repayment period under clause 46 or 47.

    * (3) The request must be made in a form and manner, contain any information, and be accompanied by any documents, required by the Secretary.

    * Secretary may revoke the suspension

    * (4) The Secretary may in writing, at any time, revoke the determination, but only if the Secretary is satisfied that the individual would not suffer severe financial hardship from the individual's Part A rate being reduced under clause 5 or 25A as a result of the revocation.

    * Determination of repayment period on revocation of suspension

    * (5) If the Secretary revokes the determination, the Secretary must determine the number of days remaining in the repayment period so that the amount by which the individual's Part A rate is to be reduced under clause 5 or 25A is an amount that is no more than the standard reduction.

        * Note: The individual may also request that the Secretary determine a shorter or longer repayment period under clause 46 or 47.

##### 50  Repayment of family tax benefit advance by another method

    * (1) The Secretary may determine that an individual may repay all or part of an amount of unrepaid family tax benefit advance by a method other than by reduction under clause 5 or 25A if:

     * (e) at the time of the variation of the determination, or the variation or substitution of the decision on review:

      * (i) the individual is entitled to be paid family tax benefit by instalment; and

## Schedule 2--Child care benefit rate calculator

  * Note: See subsection 70(1).

### Part 1--Overall rate calculation process

##### 1  Method of calculating rate of child care benefit

    * (1) If an individual's rate of child care benefit for a session of care provided to a child is to be worked out using this Schedule, the individual's hourly rate of child care benefit for the session is worked out in accordance with the following method statement:

Method statement

      * Step 1.	Use Part 2 (clause 4) to work out the standard hourly rate for the session.

      * Step 2.	Work out the individual's adjustment percentage using clause 2.

      * Step 3.	Work out that percentage of the standard hourly rate: the result is the **_individual's rate of child care benefit_** for the care.

    * (2) If the individual is eligible for child care benefit for only part of a session of care, this Schedule applies to the individual's rate of child care benefit for that part of the session as if a reference in this Schedule to a session of care included a reference to a part of a session of care.

##### 2  Adjustment percentage

    * (1) An individual's **_adjustment percentage_** for the purposes of step 2 in the method statement in clause 1 is:

    * (2) In subclause (1):

    * **_CCB %_** is:

    * **_schooling %_** is:

     * (a) 85% if the child is a school child; and

     * (b) 100% if the child is not a school child.

    * **_parttime %_** is:

     * (a) if:

      * (i) the care is provided by an approved centre based long day care service; and

      * (ii) the child is not a school child; and

      * (iii) the total number of hours in sessions of care that are provided to the child by the approved centre based long day care service, and for which the family incurs liability to pay, in the week concerned, is less than 34--110%; or

     * (b) if:

      * (i) the care is provided by an approved centre based long day care service; and

      * (ii) the child is not a school child; and

      * (iii) the total number of hours in sessions of care that are provided to the child by the approved centre based long day care service, and for which the family incurs liability to pay, in the week concerned, is 34 or more, but less than 35--108%; or

     * (c) if:

      * (i) the care is provided by an approved centre based long day care service; and

      * (ii) the child is not a school child; and

     * (d) if:

      * (i) the care is provided by an approved centre based long day care service; and

      * (ii) the child is not a school child; and

      * (iii) the total number of hours in sessions of care that are provided to the child by the approved centre based long day care service, and for which the family incurs liability to pay, in the week concerned, is 36 or more, but less than 37--104%; or

      * (ii) the child is not a school child; and

      * (iii) the total number of hours in sessions of care that are provided to the child by the approved centre based long day care service, and for which the family incurs liability to pay, in the week concerned, is 37 or more, but less than 38--102%; or

     * (f) in any other case--100%.

    * (3) In subclause (2):

    * **_multiple child %_** is worked out using Part 3 (clause 5).

    * **_taxable income %_** is worked out using Part 4 (clauses 6 to 11).

##### 3  Number of children in care of a particular kind

    * (1) An individual's multiple child % and taxable income % are affected by the number of children the individual has in care of a particular kind.

    * (2) For the purposes of applying this Schedule to work out an individual's rate of child care benefit for a session of care of a particular kind, the number of children in care of that kind is worked out in accordance with the following method statement:

Method statement

Step 1.	Work out what kind of care was provided. For this purpose, the kinds of care are:

        * (a) care other than care provided by an approved occasional care service; and

        * (b) care provided by an approved occasional care service.

      * Step 2.	Work out, in relation to the individual, how many children are in sessions of care of that kind in the week concerned for which the individual is eligible for child care benefit. That number is the **_number of children in care of that kind_** in relation to the individual and that kind of care.

### Part 2--Standard hourly rate

##### 4  Standard hourly rate--basic meaning

    * (1) The **_standard hourly rate_** for a session of care provided to a child is worked out using the following table and rounding the result to the nearest cent (rounding 0.5 cents upwards):

    * (2) For the purposes of item 2 of the table in subclause (1), the **_ceiling rate_** is:

    * where: 

    * **_item 1 rate_** is the item 1 standard hourly rate in the table in subclause (1).

    * **_number of eligible hours _**is the total number of hours in sessions of care of the kind referred to in item 2 of the table in subclause (1) that are provided to the child in the week concerned and for which the individual is eligible for child care benefit.

### Part 3--Multiple child %

##### 5  Multiple child %

    * The multiple child % for an individual's child care benefit for a session of care of a particular kind provided to a child is worked out in accordance with the following method statement:

Method statement

      * Step 1.	Use clause 3 to work out the number of children the individual has in care of that kind: the result is the **_number of children_**.

      * Step 2.	Use clause 11 to work out the individual's maximum weekly benefit: the result is the **_multiple child rate_**.

      * Step 3.	Work out what would be the individual's maximum weekly benefit under clause 11 if the individual had only one child in care of that kind and multiply it by the number of children: the result is the **_single child rate_**.

      * Step 4.	Divide the multiple child rate by the single child rate and express the result as a percentage: the result is the **_multiple child %_**.

### Part 4--Taxable income %

##### 6  Income thresholds

    * (1) There are 2 income thresholds that are relevant for working out an individual's taxable income %.

    * (2) The **_lower income threshold_** is $28,200.

    * (3) The **_upper income threshold_** is $66,000.

##### 7  Method of calculating taxable income %

    * An individual's **_taxable income %_** for a session of care provided to a child in an income year is:

     * (a) 100% if:

      * (i) the individual's adjusted taxable income for the income year does not exceed the lower income threshold; or

      * (ii) the individual or the individual's partner is receiving a social security benefit, a social security pension or a service pension or is receiving income support supplement under Part IIIA of the _Veterans' Entitlements Act 1986_; and

     * (b) worked out using clause 8 if paragraph (a) does not apply.

##### 8  Taxable income % if adjusted taxable income exceeds lower income threshold and if neither individual nor partner on income support

    * If an individual's taxable income % for a session of care provided to a child in an income year is to be worked out using this clause, it is to be worked out in accordance with the following method statement:

Method statement

      * Step 1.	Use clause 9 to work out the individual's income threshold.

      * Step 2.	Take the individual's income threshold from the individual's adjusted taxable income for the income year: the result is the individual's **_income excess_**.

      * Step 3.	Divide the income excess by 52 to convert it into a weekly amount: the result is the **_weekly income excess_**.

      * Step 4.	Use clause 10 to work out the individual's taper % and then work out that percentage of the weekly income excess: the result is the **_weekly taper amount_**.

      * Step 5.	Divide the weekly taper amount by the individual's maximum weekly benefit worked out under clause 11 and express the result as a percentage.

      * Step 6.	Take the percentage obtained in step 5 from 100% and round to 2 decimal places: the result is the individual's **_taxable income %_**. However, if the result is less than zero, the individual's **_taxable income %_** is zero.

     * (d) the individual's entitlement to family assistance of that kind, for the total period, or for the total of the periods, that the individual was a member of that couple, would be less if worked out using the final ATI amount than if worked out using the current ATI amount as determined from time to time; and

     * (e) if the current ATI amount at any time was based on an estimate provided by the individual and is less than the final ATI amount:

      * (i) at the time when the estimate was provided--the individual did not know, and had no reason to suspect, that the estimate was incorrect; and

      * (ii) if, after the estimate was provided and before ceasing to be a member of the couple, the individual knew or had reason to suspect that the estimate was incorrect--the individual provided a revised estimate as soon as practicable after knowing or suspecting that the estimate was incorrect;

    * then, despite the final determination of that adjusted taxable income by the Secretary, the individual's adjusted taxable income during any period during the income year:

     * (f) that the individual and partner A were a couple; and

     * (g) that a particular current ATI amount applied;

    * is to be taken to be that particular current ATI amount.

##### 4  Adjusted fringe benefits total

    * **_indexation day_** means 1 July 2005.

    * **_reference quarter_** means December quarter 2004.

    * **_rounding base_** means $3.65.

##### 4  Indexation of amounts

    * (1) If an amount is to be indexed under this Part on an indexation day, this Act has effect as if the indexed amount were substituted for that amount on that day.

    * (2) This is how to work out the indexed amount for an amount that is to be indexed under this Part on an indexation day: 

Method statement 

      * Step 1.	Use clause 5 to work out the indexation factor for the amount on the indexation day. 

      * Step 2.	Work out the current figure for the amount immediately before the indexation day. 

      * Step 3.	Multiply the current figure by the indexation factor: the result is the **_provisional indexed amount_**. 

      * Step 4 .	Use clause 6 to round off the provisional indexed amount: the result is the indexed amount.

##### 5  Indexation factor

    * (1) Subject to subclauses (2) and (3) and clauses 10 and 11, the indexation factor for an amount that is to be indexed under this Part on an indexation day is:

    * worked out to 3 decimal places.

    * (2) If an indexation factor worked out under subclause (1) would, if it were worked out to 4 decimal places, end in a number that is greater than 4, the indexation factor is to be increased by 0.001.

    * (3) If an indexation factor worked out under subclauses (1) and (2) would be less than 1, the indexation factor is to be increased to 1.

    * (4) Subject to subclause (5), if at any time (whether before or after the commencement of this clause), the Australian Statistician publishes an index number for a quarter in substitution for an index number previously published by the Australian Statistician for that quarter, the publication of the later index number is to be disregarded for the purposes of this clause.

    * (5) If at any time (whether before or after the commencement of this clause) the Australian Statistician changes the reference base for the Consumer Price Index, regard is to be had, for the purposes of applying this clause after the change takes place, only to index numbers published in terms of the new reference base.

##### 6  Rounding off indexed amounts

    * (1) If a provisional indexed amount is a multiple of the rounding base, the provisional indexed amount becomes the indexed amount.

    * (2) If a provisional indexed amount is not a multiple of the rounding base, the indexed amount is the provisional indexed amount rounded up or down to the nearest multiple of the rounding base.

    * (3) If a provisional indexed amount is not a multiple of the rounding base but is a multiple of half the rounding base, the indexed amount is the provisional indexed amount rounded up to the nearest multiple of the rounding base.

### Part 4--Transitional indexation provisions

##### 9  Adjustment of amounts following 10% increase to maximum rent assistance amounts

    * (1) This clause applies to modify the way an amount specified in column 3 of the table in clause 14 or 14A of Schedule 1 (the **_maximum rent assistance amount_**) is indexed under Part 2 of this Schedule for a limited period after 19 March 2001.

Method statement

      * Step 1.	Work out the current figure for the maximum rent assistance amount on 19 March 2001.

      * Step 2.	Multiply the current figure by 0.02. The result is the **_provisional overall adjustment amount_**.

      * Step 3.	Round off the provisional overall adjustment amount in accordance with subclauses (2) to (4). The result is the **_overall adjustment amount_**.

      * Step 4.	For the first indexation day for the maximum rent assistance amount that occurs after 19 March 2001, subtract the current figure for the amount from the indexed amount (arrived at using the method statement in subclause 4(2)). The result (which could be zero) is the **_first indexation increase amount_**.

      * Step 5.	Compare the overall adjustment amount with the first indexation increase amount. If the overall adjustment amount is equal to or less than the first indexation increase amount, go to step 6. If the overall adjustment amount is greater than the first indexation increase amount, go to step 7.

      * Step 6.	Subtract the overall adjustment amount from the indexed amount referred to in step 4. The result is taken to be the indexed amount for the purposes of step 4 of the method statement in subclause 4(2) and this clause has no further application in relation to the maximum rent assistance amount.

      * Step 7.	The indexed amount for the purposes of step 4 of the method statement in subclause 4(2) is taken to be equal to the current figure worked out under step 2 of that method statement. Go to step 8.

      * Step 8.	For the second indexation day for the maximum rent assistance amount that occurs after 19 March 2001, subtract the first indexation increase amount from the overall adjustment amount. The result is the **_remaining adjustment amount_**.

      * Step 9.	Subtract the current figure for the maximum rent assistance amount from the indexed amount (arrived at using the method statement in subclause 4(2)). The result (which could be zero) is the **_second indexation increase amount_**.

      * Step 10.	Compare the remaining adjustment amount with the second indexation increase amount. If the remaining adjustment amount is equal to or less than the second indexation increase amount, go to step 11. If the remaining adjustment amount is greater than the second indexation increase amount, go to step 12.

      * Step 11.	Subtract the remaining adjustment amount from the indexed amount. The result is taken to be the indexed amount for the purposes of step 4 of the method statement in subclause 4(2) and this clause has no further application in relation to the maximum rent assistance amount.

      * Step 12.	The indexed amount for the purposes of step 4 of the method statement in subclause 4(2) is taken to be equal to the current figure worked out under step 2 of that method statement. Go to step 13.

      * Step 13.	Repeat the method set out in steps 8 to 12 in relation to the third indexation day and to subsequent indexation days until the remaining adjustment amount is zero.

    * Rounding of provisional overall adjustment amounts

    * (2) If a provisional overall adjustment amount is a multiple of the rounding base for the maximum rent assistance amount (see column 5 of item 4 of the CPI Indexation Table in subclause 3(1)), the provisional overall adjustment amount is the overall adjustment amount.

    * (3) If a provisional overall adjustment amount is not a multiple of the rounding base, the overall adjustment amount is the provisional overall adjustment amount rounded up or down to the nearest multiple of the rounding base.

    * (4) If a provisional overall adjustment amount is not a multiple of the rounding base, but is a multiple of half the rounding base, the overall adjustment amount is the provisional overall adjustment amount rounded up to the nearest multiple of the rounding base.

##### 10  Adjustment of indexation factor for certain amounts on and after 1 July 2013

    * (1) This clause applies to the following amounts:

     * (a) FTB child rate (A1);

     * (b) FTB child rate (A2);

     * (c) FTB standard rate (B);

     * (d) FTB standard ACO rate.

    * (2) For each amount to which this clause applies, the indexation factor, worked out under clause 5 for each indexation day that is on or after 1 July 2013, is to be reduced by the brought forward indexation amount, but not below 1.

    * (3) In this clause:

    * **_brought forward indexation amount_**, in relation to an indexation day, means 0.007 less any reduction made under this clause for a previous indexation day.

        * Note: Once the brought forward indexation amount becomes zero, there will be no further reduction of the indexation factor.

        * Example: Assume that the indexation factor worked out under clause 5 on 1 July 2013 is 1.004. The brought forward indexation amount in relation to 1 July 2013 is 0.007 (as there has been no previous reduction). That indexation factor is reduced to 1 on 1 July 2013.

        * Further assume that on 1 July 2014 the indexation factor is 1.010. The brought forward indexation amount in relation to 1 July 2014 is 0.003. That indexation factor is reduced to 1.007 on 1 July 2014.

        * The brought forward indexation amount in relation to later indexation days is now zero so there is no further reduction of the indexation factor.

##### 11  Adjustment of indexation factor for certain amounts on and after 1 July 2014

    * (1) This clause applies to the following amounts:

     * (a) FTB gross supplement amount (A);

     * (b) FTB gross supplement amount (B).

    * (2) For each amount to which this clause applies, the indexation factor, worked out under clause 5 for each indexation day (a **_reduction day_**) that is on or after 1 July 2014, is to be reduced by the brought forward indexation amount, but not below 1.

    * (3) In this clause:

    * **_brought forward indexation amount_**, in relation to a reduction day, means 0.007 less:

     * (a) any reduction made under subclause 10(2) on 1 July 2013; and

     * (b) any reduction made under this clause for a previous reduction day.

        * Note: Once the brought forward indexation amount becomes zero, there will be no further reduction of the indexation factor.

        * Example: Assume that the indexation factor worked out under clause 5 on 1 July 2014 is 1.010 and that there was a reduction of 0.004 under subclause 10(2) on 1 July 2013.

        * The brought forward indexation amount in relation to 1 July 2014 is 0.003. The indexation factor worked out under clause 5 on 1 July 2014 is reduced to 1.007.

        * The brought forward indexation amount in relation to later reduction days is now zero so there is no further reduction of the indexation factor.
