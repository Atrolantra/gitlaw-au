#### Division 2--Objects

##### 21  The objects of this Act

    * (1) The objects of this Act are as follows:

     * (a) to provide for funding of *aged care that takes account of:

      * (i) the quality of the care; and

      * (ii) the *type of care and level of care provided; and

      * (iii) the need to ensure access to care that is affordable by, and appropriate to the needs of, people who require it; and

      * (iv) appropriate outcomes for recipients of the care; and

      * (v) accountability of the providers of the care for the funding and for the outcomes for recipients;

     * (b) to promote a high quality of care and accommodation for the recipients of *aged care services that meets the needs of individuals;

     * (c) to protect the health and wellbeing of the recipients of aged care services;

     * (d) to ensure that aged care services are targeted towards the people with the greatest needs for those services;

     * (e) to facilitate access to aged care services by those who need them, regardless of race, culture, language, gender, economic circumstance or geographic location;

     * (f) to provide respite for families, and others, who care for older people;

     * (g) to encourage diverse, flexible and responsive aged care services that:

      * (i) are appropriate to meet the needs of the recipients of those services and the carers of those recipients; and

      * (ii) facilitate the independence of, and choice available to, those recipients and carers;

     * (h) to help those recipients to enjoy the same rights as all other people in Australia;

     * (i) to plan effectively for the delivery of aged care services that:

      * (i) promote the targeting of services to areas of the greatest need and people with the greatest need; and

      * (ii) avoid duplication of those services; and

     * (j) to promote ageing in place through the linking of care and support services to the places where older people prefer to live.

    * (2) In construing the objects, due regard must be had to:

     * (a) the limited resources available to support services and programs under this Act; and

     * (b) the need to consider equity and merit in accessing those resources.

#### Division 3--Overview of this Act

##### 31  General

    * (1) This Act provides for the Commonwealth to give financial support:

     * (a) through payment of *subsidies for the provision of *aged care; and

     * (b) through payment of grants for other matters connected with the provision of aged care.

    * Subsidies are paid under Chapter 3 (but Chapters 2 and 4 are also relevant to subsidies), and grants are paid under Chapter 5.

    * (2) *Subsidies are also paid under Chapter 3 of the _Aged Care (Transitional Provisions) Act 1997_.

##### 32  Preliminary matters relating to subsidies (Chapter 2)

    * Before the Commonwealth can pay *subsidy to a provider of *aged care, a number of approvals and similar decisions may need to have been made under Chapter 2. These may relate to:

     * (a) the provider (for example, the requirement that the provider be an approved provider); or

     * (b) the *aged care service in question (for example, the requirement that *places have been allocated in respect of the service); or

     * (c) the recipient of aged care (for example, the requirement that the recipient has been approved as a recipient of the type of aged care that is provided).

##### 33  Subsidies

    * A number of different kinds of *subsidy can be paid. They are paid for *aged care that has been provided. Eligibility for a subsidy depends on:

     * (a) particular approvals and similar decisions having been made under Chapter 2; and

     * (b) the circumstances in which the care is provided (for example, whether the care is provided in a residential care service that meets its *accreditation requirement).

##### 33A  Fees and payments

    * Care recipients may be required to pay for, or contribute to, the costs of their care and accommodation. Fees and payments are dealt with in Chapter 3A of this Act, and in Divisions 57, 57A, 58 and 60 of the _Aged Care (Transitional Provisions) Act 1997_.

##### 34  Responsibilities of approved providers (Chapter 4)

    * Approved providers have certain responsibilities under Chapter 4. These responsibilities relate to:

     * (a) the quality of care they provide; and

     * (b) user rights for the people to whom care is provided; and

     * (c) accountability for the care that is provided, and the basic suitability of their *key personnel.

    * Failure to meet these responsibilities can lead to the imposition of sanctions that affect the status of approvals and similar decisions under Chapter 2 (and therefore may affect amounts of *subsidy payable to an approved provider).

##### 35  Grants (Chapter 5)

    * The Commonwealth makes grants under Chapter 5 to contribute to costs associated with: 

     * (a) the establishment or enhancement of *aged care services (for example, *residential care grants); or

     * (c) support services related to the provision of aged care (for example, *advocacy grants).

    * The grants are (in most cases) payable under agreements with the recipients of the grants, and may be subject to conditions.

#### Division 4--Application of this Act

##### 41  Application of this Act

    * (1) This Act applies in all the States and Territories.

    * (2) However, this Act does not apply in any external Territory, except the Territory of Christmas Island and the Territory of Cocos (Keeling) Islands.

    * (3) Despite subsection (1), Parts 2.2, 2.5 and 3.1 apply in relation to the Territory of Christmas Island and the Territory of Cocos (Keeling) Islands as if those Territories were part of Western Australia and were not Territories.

        * Note: This has the effect that references in Parts 2.2, 2.5 and 3.1 to a Territory do not apply to the Territory of Christmas Island or the Territory of Cocos (Keeling) Islands, and that references in those Parts to a State will be relevant to Western Australia as if it included those Territories.

##### 42  Binding the Crown

    * (1) This Act binds the Crown in each of its capacities.

    * (2) This Act does not make the Crown liable to be prosecuted for an offence.

## Chapter 2--Preliminary matters relating to subsidies

#### Division 5--Introduction

##### 51  What this Chapter is about

    * Before the Commonwealth can pay a *subsidy for the provision of care, a number of approvals and similar decisions may need to have been made. These relate to:

     *  	the provider of the service--the provider must be an approved provider (see Part 2.1);

     *  	the *aged care service in question--*places must have been allocated in respect of the service (see Part 2.2). In addition, decisions can be made under Part 2.5 allowing places in a residential care service to become *extra service places (enabling higher fees to be charged for those places);

     *  	the recipient of the care--the recipient must (in most cases) be approved in respect of the type of *aged care provided (see Part 2.3), and (in the case of residential care or flexible care) can be classified in respect of the level of care that is required (see Part 2.4).

        * Note: Not all of these approvals and decisions are needed in respect of each kind of subsidy.

##### 52  Which approvals etc. may be relevant

    * The following table shows, in respect of each kind of payment under Chapter 3 of this Act or Chapter 3 of the _Aged Care (Transitional Provisions) Act 1997_, which approvals and similar decisions under this Chapter may be relevant.

        * Note 1: Classification of care recipients is relevant to *flexible care subsidy only in respect of some kinds of flexible care services.

        * Note 2: Allocation of funding for grants is dealt with in Chapter 5.

##### 362  Extra service agreements not to be entered under duress etc.

    * (1) An *extra service agreement must not be entered into in circumstances under which the care recipient is subject to duress, misrepresentation, or threat of disadvantage or detriment.

    * (2) An *extra service agreement must not be entered into in a way that contravenes the Extra Service Principles.

    * (3) Without limiting subsection (1), a threat to cease providing care to a care recipient through a particular residential care service unless the care recipient signs an *extra service agreement is taken to be a threat of disadvantage for the purposes of that subsection.

##### 363  Contents of extra service agreements

    * (1) An *extra service agreement must specify:

     * (a) the level of the extra service amount (within the meaning of section 585) in respect of the *place concerned; and

     * (b) how the extra service amount may be varied; and

     * (c) the standard of the accommodation, services and food to be provided to the care recipient.

        * Note: The notice under subsection 329(1) will specify minimum standards, but care recipients and the persons providing care may make agreements to provide more than the minimum.

    * (2) An *extra service agreement must also:

     * (a) contain the provisions (if any) set out in the Extra Service Principles; and

     * (b) deal with the matters (if any) specified in the Extra Service Principles.

##### 364  Additional protection for existing residents

    * An *extra service agreement entered into with a care recipient who was being provided with care in a residential care service, or a *distinct part of a residential care service, immediately before *extra service status became effective under Division 32 must provide that the care recipient may terminate the agreement:

     * (a) at any time during the 3 months after the date of effect of the agreement; and

     * (b) without penalty of any kind.

        * Note: Under paragraph 561(g), an approved provider has a responsibility to comply with this Division. A failure to comply may lead to sanctions being imposed under Part 4.4.

## Chapter 3--Subsidies

#### Division 40--Introduction

##### 401  What this Chapter is about

    * The Commonwealth pays *subsidies under this Chapter to approved providers for *aged care that has been provided. These subsidies are:

     *  	*residential care subsidy (see Part 3.1);

     *  	*home care subsidy (see Part 3.2);

     *  	*flexible care subsidy (see Part 3.3).

    * A number of approvals and other decisions may need to have been made under Chapter 2 before a particular kind of payment can be made (see section 52). Receipt of payments under this Chapter gives rise to certain responsibilities, that are dealt with in Chapter 4.

### Part 3.1--Residential care subsidy

#### Division 41--Introduction

##### 411  What this Part is about

    * The *residential care subsidy is a payment by the Commonwealth to approved providers for providing residential care to care recipients.

     * 43	How is residential care subsidy paid?

     * 44	What is the amount of residential care subsidy?

##### 412  The Subsidy Principles

    * *Residential care subsidy is also dealt with in the Subsidy Principles. Provisions in this Part indicate when a particular matter is or may be dealt with in these Principles.

        * Note: The Subsidy Principles are made by the Minister under section 961.

##### 413  Meaning of residential care

    * (1) **_Residential care_** is personal care or nursing care, or both personal care and nursing care, that:

     * (a) is provided to a person in a residential facility in which the person is also provided with accommodation that includes:

      * (i) appropriate staffing to meet the nursing and personal care needs of the person; and

      * (ii) meals and cleaning services; and

      * (iii) furnishings, furniture and equipment for the provision of that care and accommodation; and

     * (b) meets any other requirements specified in the Subsidy Principles.

    * (2) However, residential care does not include any of the following:

     * (a) care provided to a person in the person's private home;

     * (b) care provided in a hospital or in a psychiatric facility;

     * (c) care provided in a facility that primarily provides care to people who are not frail and aged;

     * (d) care that is specified in the Subsidy Principles not to be residential care.

#### Division 42--Who is eligible for residential care subsidy?

##### 421  Eligibility for residential care subsidy

    * (1) An approved provider is eligible for *residential care subsidy in respect of a day if the Secretary is satisfied that, during that day:

     * (a) the approved provider holds an allocation of *places for residential care subsidy that is in force under Part 2.2 (not being a *provisional allocation); and

     * (b) the approved provider provides residential care to a care recipient in respect of whom an approval is in force under Part 2.3 as a recipient of residential care; and

     * (c) the residential care service through which the care is provided meets its *accreditation requirement (if any) applying at that time (see section 424).

        * Note 1: A care recipient can be taken to be provided with residential care while he or she is on *leave from that care (see section 422).

        * Note 2: If the care recipient's approval under Part 2.3 is not in force, subsidy will not be payable. (For example, the approval may have been given only for a limited period.)

    * (2) However, the approved provider is not eligible in respect of residential care provided to the care recipient during that day if:

     * (a) it is excluded because the approved provider exceeds the approved provider's allocation of *places for residential care subsidy (see section 427); or

     * (b) the approved provider stopped providing residential care to the person during that day; or

     * (c) subject to subsection (3), another approved provider would, but for this paragraph, also be eligible for *residential care subsidy in respect of residential care provided to the same care recipient during that day.

    * (3) Paragraph (2)(c) does not apply if the approved provider started providing residential care to the care recipient before the other approved provider.

        * Note: Eligibility may also be affected by Division 7 (relating to a person's approval as a provider of aged care services) or Division 20 (relating to a person's approval as a recipient of residential care).

##### 422  Leave from residential care services

    * (1) On each day during which a care recipient is on *leave under this section from a residential care service, the care recipient is taken, for the purposes of this Part (other than section 423) and for the purposes of section 67A5, to be provided with residential care by the approved provider operating the residential care service.

    * (2) A care recipient is on *leave under this section from a residential care service on each day of any period during which the care recipient attends a hospital for the purpose of receiving hospital treatment, so long as the day is on or after the day on which the care recipient *enters the residential care service.

        * Note: Attending a hospital for a period of extended hospital leave may result in the Minister determining a lower basic subsidy amount for the recipient for days occurring during that period, which will affect the amount of subsidy that is payable (see section 443).

    * (3) A care recipient is on *leave under this section from a residential care service on a day if:

     * (a) during the whole of that day, the care recipient is absent from the residential care service; and

     * (b) either:

      * (i) the care recipient does not, during that day, attend a hospital for the purpose of receiving hospital treatment; or

      * (ii) the care recipient does, during that day, attend a hospital for that purpose and the day is before the day on which the care recipient *enters the residential care service; and

     * (c) the number of days on which the care recipient has previously been on leave under this subsection, during the current financial year, is less than 52.

        * Note: If a care recipient is taken not to have been provided with care because the maximum number of days has been exceeded, subsidy will not be payable in respect of those days. However, the care recipient may agree to pay a fee to the approved provider to reserve the care recipient's *place in the service. The maximum amount in such a case is set by section 586.

    * (3A) A care recipient is on *leave under this section from a residential care service on a day if:

     * (a) *flexible care subsidy is payable in respect of the care recipient and the day; and

     * (b) the requirements specified in the Subsidy Principles for the purposes of this paragraph are met.

        * Note: If a care recipient is on leave for at least 30 days continuously under subsections (2) and (3A), this may result in the Minister determining a lower basic subsidy amount for the recipient for days occurring during that period, which will affect the amount of residential care subsidy that is payable (see section 443).

    * (4) Despite subsections (2), (3) and (3A), a care recipient cannot be on *leave under this section from a residential care service during any period during which the residential care in question would have been *respite care.

##### 423  Working out periods of leave

    * (1) In working out the days on which a care recipient is on *leave under section 422:

     * (a) include the day on which the period commenced; and

     * (b) do not include the day on which the approved provider recommenced, or commenced, providing residential care to the care recipient.

        * Note: Absences that do not include an overnight absence from a residential care service are not counted as *leave because of paragraph (b).

    * (2) Subject to subsection (3), a care recipient cannot be on *leave under section 422 from a residential care service before he or she *enters the service.

    * (3) A care recipient may be on leave (the **_preentry leave_**) under section 422 on the days during the period starting on the later of:

     * (a) the day on which he or she was notified that there was a vacancy in the residential care service in question; or

     * (aa) the day on which he or she accepted a place in the residential care service; or

     * (b) the day that is 7 days, or such other period as is specified in the Subsidy Principles, before the day on which the person *enters the residential care service;

    * and ending on the day of entry.

##### 424  Accreditation requirement

    * A residential care service meets its accreditation requirement at all times during which: 

     * (a) there is in force an accreditation of the service by the *CEO of the Quality Agency; or

     * (b) there is in force a determination under section 425 that the service is taken, for the purposes of this Division, to meet its accreditation requirement.

##### 425  Determinations allowing for exceptional circumstances

    * (1) The Secretary may determine, in accordance with the Subsidy Principles, that a residential care service is taken, for the purposes of this Division, to meet its *accreditation requirement. However, the Secretary must first be satisfied that exceptional circumstances apply to the service.

        * Note: Refusals to make determinations are reviewable under Part 6.1.

    * (3) The Secretary must not make a determination if:

     * (a) there is an immediate or severe risk to the safety or wellbeing of care recipients to whom residential care is being provided through the residential care service; or

     * (b) the approved provider has not applied for accreditation of the service; or

     * (c) a determination under this section has previously been made in relation to the service and the service has not subsequently met its *accreditation requirement as set out in section 424; or

     * (d) any circumstances specified in the Subsidy Principles for the purposes of this paragraph apply.

    * (4) A determination ceases to be in force on the earlier of:

     * (a) the end of 6 months, or such shorter period as is specified in the determination, after the determination is made; or

     * (b) the occurrence of a specified event, if the determination so provides.

        * Note: Determinations specifying periods or events are reviewable under Part 6.1.

    * (4A) A determination made under subsection (1) is not a legislative instrument.

    * (5) If the Secretary needs further information to determine the application, the Secretary may give to the applicant a notice requesting the applicant to give the further information within 28 days after receiving the notice.

    * (6) The application is taken to be withdrawn if the applicant does not give the further information within 28 days.

        * Note: The period for giving the further information can be extended--see section 967.

    * (7) The notice must contain a statement setting out the effect of subsection (6).

    * (8) The Secretary must notify the approved provider, in writing, of the Secretary's decision on whether to make the determination. If the Secretary makes the determination, the notice must inform the approved provider of:

##### 426  Revocation of determinations

    * (1) The Secretary must revoke a determination under section 425 if satisfied that:

     * (a) the exceptional circumstances that applied to the residential care service in question at the time the determination was made no longer apply; or

     * (b) circumstances have changed such that one or more of the circumstances referred to in subsection 425(3) now applies.

        * Note: Revocations of determinations are reviewable under Part 6.1.

    * (2) The Secretary must, in writing, notify the approved provider conducting the service of the Secretary's decision to revoke the determination. The notice must be given within 7 days after the decision is made.

##### 427  Exceeding the number of places for which there is an allocation

    * (1) For the purposes of a person's eligibility for *residential care subsidy, residential care provided to a particular care recipient on a particular day is excluded if:

     * (a) the number of care recipients provided with residential care by the approved provider during that day exceeds the number of *places included in the approved provider's allocation of places for residential care subsidy; and

     * (b) the Secretary decides, in accordance with subsection (2), that the residential care provided to that particular care recipient on that day is to be excluded.

    * (2) In deciding under paragraph (1)(b) which residential care is to be excluded, the Secretary must:

     * (a) make the number of exclusions necessary to ensure that the number of *places for which *residential care subsidy will be payable does not exceed the number of places included in the approved provider's allocation of places for residential care subsidy; and

     * (b) exclude the residential care in the reverse order in which the care recipients *entered the residential care service for the provision of residential care.

##### 428  Notice of refusal to pay residential care subsidy

    * (1) If:

     * (a) an approved provider has claimed *residential care subsidy in respect of a person; and

     * (b) the approved provider is not eligible for residential care subsidy in respect of that person;

    * the Secretary must notify the approved provider, in writing, accordingly.

    * (2) A notice given under subsection (1) is not a legislative instrument.

#### Division 43--How is residential care subsidy paid?

##### 431  Payment of residential care subsidy

    * (1) Residential care subsidy is payable by the Commonwealth to an approved provider in respect of each *payment period (see section 432) during which the approved provider is eligible under section 421. However, it is not payable in respect of any days during that period on which the approved provider is not eligible.

    * (2) Residential care subsidy is separately payable by the Commonwealth in respect of each residential care service through which the approved provider provides residential care.

    * (3) The Secretary may, in accordance with the Subsidy Principles, deduct from the amount of residential care subsidy otherwise payable in respect of a *payment period such of the following amounts as apply to the residential care service in question:

     * (a) deductions for fees (see section 435);

     * (b) *capital repayment deductions (see section 436);

     * (d) noncompliance deductions (see section 438).

##### 432  Meaning of payment period

    * A **_payment period_** is:

     * (a) a calendar month; or

     * (b) such other period as is set out in the Subsidy Principles.

##### 433  Advances

    * (1) Subject to subsection 434(2), *residential care subsidy is payable by the Commonwealth in advance, in respect of a *payment period, at such times as the Secretary thinks fit.

    * (2) The Secretary must work out the amount of an advance to be paid to an approved provider in respect of the first *payment period or the second payment period for a residential care service by estimating the amount of *residential care subsidy that will be payable for the days in that period.

    * (3) The Secretary must work out the amount of an advance to be paid to an approved provider in respect of subsequent *payment periods for a residential care service by:

     * (a) estimating the amount of *residential care subsidy that will be payable (taking into account any deductions under subsection 431(3)) for the days in the period; and

     * (b) increasing or reducing that amount to make any adjustments that the Secretary reasonably believes are necessary to take account of likely underpayments or overpayments in respect of advances previously paid under this section.

    * (4) The amounts of advances must be worked out in accordance with any requirements set out in the Subsidy Principles.

    * (5) The Secretary may, in deciding whether to reduce the amount of an advance under paragraph (3)(b), take into account the likelihood of the Commonwealth's right to recover a particular overpayment being waived under section 956.

        * Note: Subsection (5) allows the Secretary to take account of waivers in respect of overpayments caused, for example, by some cases of incorrect determinations of the *ordinary incomes of care recipients.

##### 434  Claims for residential care subsidy

    * (1) For the purpose of obtaining payment of *residential care subsidy in respect of a residential care service through which an approved provider provides residential care, the approved provider must, as soon as practicable after the end of each *payment period, give to the Secretary:

     * (a) a claim, in the form approved by the Secretary, for residential care subsidy that is payable in respect of the residential care service for that payment period; and

     * (b) any information relating to the claim that is stated in the form to be required, or that the Secretary requests; and

     * (c) copies of any documents relating to the claim, or to the payment of *residential care subsidy, that are stated in the form to be required, or that the Secretary requests.

    * (2) An advance of *residential care subsidy is not payable in respect of a *payment period for the residential care service if the approved provider has not given to the Secretary under subsection (1) a claim relating to the second last preceding payment period for the service.

        * Example: An advance of subsidy is not payable for March if the Secretary has not been given a claim for January of the same year (assuming the *payment periods are all calendar months--see section 432).

    * (3) Subsection (2) does not apply to the first *payment period or the second payment period for a residential care service.

    * (4) If all the places in a residential care service are transferred from one person to another, subsection (2) does not apply to the first 2 *payment periods for the residential care service that occur after the transfer took effect.

    * (5) If:

     * (a) apart from this subsection, the operation of paragraph (1)(c) would result in the acquisition of property from a person otherwise than on just terms; and

     * (b) the acquisition would be invalid because of paragraph 51(xxxi) of the Constitution;

    * the Commonwealth is liable to pay compensation of a reasonable amount to the person in respect of the acquisition.

##### 434A  Variations of claims for residential care subsidy

    * (1) An approved provider may vary the claim made in respect of a *payment period within:

     * (a) 2 years after the end of the payment period; or

     * (b) such longer period as is determined in respect of the claim by the Secretary.

    * (2) In determining a longer period for the purposes of paragraph (1)(b), the Secretary must be satisfied that a variation is required:

     * (a) due to an administrative error made by the Commonwealth or an agent of the Commonwealth; or

     * (b) because the Commonwealth or an agent of the Commonwealth considers that the circumstances of a care recipient are different from those on the basis of which subsidy was claimed.

        * Note: Determinations of periods under paragraph (1)(b) are reviewable under Part 6.1.

    * (3) A determination made under paragraph (1)(b) is not a legislative instrument.

##### 435  Deductions for fees

    * The Secretary may, on behalf of the Commonwealth, enter into an agreement with an approved provider, under which:

     * (a) amounts equal to the fees payable by the approved provider for applications made under this Act are to be deducted from amounts of *residential care subsidy otherwise payable to the approved provider in respect of the residential care service specified in the agreement; and

     * (b) so far as amounts are so deducted, the approved provider ceases to be liable to the Commonwealth for payment of the fees.

##### 436  Capital repayment deductions

    * (1) Capital repayment deductions apply in respect of a residential care service if:

     * (a) the approved provider is granted *extra service status under Division 32 in respect of the service, or in respect of a *distinct part of the service; and

     * (b) the Commonwealth has previously made capital payments in respect of the service, whether or not the payments were made to that approved provider; and

     * _	_(c)	the payments have not been repaid to the Commonwealth.

    * The capital repayment deductions are applied in accordance with an agreement entered into under this section.

    * (2) The Secretary may, on behalf of the Commonwealth, enter into an agreement with the approved provider, under which:

     * (a) amounts equal to the capital payments made in respect of the service are to be deducted from amounts of *residential care subsidy otherwise payable to the approved provider in respect of the service; and

     * (b) so far as amounts are so deducted, the approved provider ceases to be liable to the Commonwealth for repayment in respect of the capital payments.

        * Note: Entering into such an agreement may be a condition of the granting of *extra service status (see paragraph 328(5)(b)).

    * (3) However, only a proportion of the amounts equal to the capital payments made in respect of the service are to be deducted under the agreement if:

     * (a) *extra service status is granted only in respect of a *distinct part of the service; or

     * (b) some or all of the capital payments were made more than 5 years before the first of the deductions is to be made; or

     * (c) the circumstances (if any) specified in the Subsidy Principles apply.

    * The proportion is to be worked out in accordance with the Subsidy Principles.

    * (4) The agreement must provide for the deductions to be completed within 3 years after the making of the first deduction.

    * (5) In this section:

    * **_capital payment_** means:

     * (a) a *residential care grant; or

     * (b) a payment of a kind specified in the Subsidy Principles.

##### 438  Noncompliance deductions

    * (1) Subject to subsection (2), noncompliance deductions apply in respect of a residential care service if conditions specified in the Subsidy Principles, to which the allocation of the *places included in the service are subject under section 145 or 146, have not been met.

    * (2) The Subsidy Principles may specify circumstances in which noncompliance deductions do not apply even if the conditions referred to in subsection (1) have not been met.

    * (3) The Secretary must notify the approved provider conducting a residential care service if, in respect of a *payment period, noncompliance deductions apply in respect of the residential care service. The notice must be in writing and must set out why noncompliance deductions apply.

    * (3A) A notice given under subsection (3) is not a legislative instrument.

    * (4) The amount of a noncompliance deduction is the amount worked out in accordance with the Subsidy Principles.

        * Note: Noncompliance deductions do not affect the maximum fees payable by residents (see Division 58).

##### 439  Recovery of overpayments

    * This Division does not affect the Commonwealth's right to recover overpayments under Part 6.5.

#### Division 44--What is the amount of residential care subsidy?

##### 441  What this Division is about

    * Amounts of *residential care subsidy payable under Division 43 to an approved provider are worked out under this Division in respect of each residential care service. The amount in respect of a residential care service is determined by adding together amounts worked out, using the residential care subsidy calculator in section 442, in respect of individual care recipients in the service.

     * 44F	Other supplements

##### Subdivision 44A--Working out the amount of residential care subsidy

##### 442  Amount of residential care subsidy

    * (1) The amount of *residential care subsidy payable to an approved provider for a residential care service in respect of a *payment period is the amount worked out by adding together the amounts of residential care subsidy for each care recipient:

     * (a) to whom the approved provider provided residential care through the residential care service during the period; and

     * (b) in respect of whom the approved provider was eligible for residential care subsidy during the period.

    * (2) This is how to work out the amount of *residential care subsidy for a care recipient in respect of the *payment period.

Residential care subsidy calculator

      * Step 1.	Work out the **_basic subsidy amount_** using Subdivision 44B.

      * Step 2.	Add to this amount the amounts of any **_primary supplements_** worked out using Subdivision 44C.

      * Step 3.	Subtract the amounts of any **_reductions in subsidy_** worked out using Subdivision 44D.

      * Step 4.	Add the amounts of any **_other supplements_** worked out using Subdivision 44F.

    * The result is the **_amount of residential care subsidy_** for the care recipient in respect of the payment period.

##### Subdivision 44B--The basic subsidy amount

##### 443  The basic subsidy amount

    * (1) The basic subsidy amount for the care recipient in respect of the *payment period is the sum of all the basic subsidy amounts for the days during the period on which the care recipient was provided with residential care through the residential care service in question.

    * (2) The basic subsidy amount for a day is the amount determined by the Minister by legislative instrument.

    * (3) The Minister may determine different amounts (including nil amounts) based on any one or more of the following:

     * (a) the *classification levels for care recipients being provided with residential care;

     * (b) whether the residential care being provided is *respite care;

     * (ca) whether a care recipient is on *extended hospital leave;

     * (cb) whether an appraisal of a care recipient's care needs is received after the end of the period mentioned in paragraph 261(a) or (b) (whichever is applicable);

     * (cc) whether a reappraisal of a care recipient's care needs is received after the end of the reappraisal period for the classification determined under section 272;

     * (e) any other matters specified in the Subsidy Principles;

     * (f) any other matters determined by the Minister.

    * (4) The Minister must not determine a different amount for a day based on the care recipient being on *extended hospital leave that is less than half of the amount that would have been the basic subsidy amount if the care recipient had not been on extended hospital leave on that day.

##### Subdivision 44C--Primary supplements

##### 445  Primary supplements

    * (1) The primary supplements for the care recipient are such of the following primary supplements as apply to the care recipient in respect of the *payment period:

##### 4421  The care subsidy reduction

    * (1) The **_care subsidy reduction_** for the care recipient in respect of the *payment period is the sum of all the care subsidy reductions for days during the period on which the care recipient is provided with residential care through the residential care service in question.

    * (2) Subject to this section and section 4423, the care subsidy reduction for a particular day is worked out as follows:

Care subsidy reduction calculator

      * Step 1.	Work out the **_means tested amount_** for the care recipient (see section 4422).

      * Step 2.	Subtract the **_maximum accommodation supplement amount_** for the day (see subsection (6)) from the means tested amount.

      * Step 3.	If the amount worked out under step 2 does not exceed zero, the **_care subsidy reduction_** is zero.

      * Step 4.	If the amount worked out under step 2 exceeds zero but not the sum of the following, the **_care subsidy reduction_** is the amount worked out under step 2:

        * (a) the basic subsidy amount for the care recipient;

        * (b) all primary supplement amounts for the care recipient.

      * Step 5.	If the amount worked out under step 2 exceeds the sum of the following, the **_care subsidy reduction_** is that sum:

        * (a) the basic subsidy amount for the care recipient;

        * (b) all primary supplement amounts for the care recipient.

    * (3) If the care recipient has not provided sufficient information about the care recipient's income and assets for the care recipient's means tested amount to be determined, the **_care subsidy reduction_** is the sum of the basic subsidy and primary supplement amounts for the care recipient.

    * (4) If, apart from this subsection, the sum of all the *combined care subsidy reductions made for the care recipient during a *startdate year for the care recipient would exceed the annual cap applying at the time for the care recipient, the **_care subsidy reduction_** for the remainder of the startdate year is zero.

    * (5) If, apart from this subsection, the sum of all the previous *combined care subsidy reductions made for the care recipient would exceed the lifetime cap applying at the time, the **_care subsidy reduction_** for the remainder of the care recipient's life is zero.

    * (6) The **_maximum accommodation supplement amount_** for a day is the highest of the amounts determined by the Minister by legislative instrument as the amounts of accommodation supplement payable for residential care services for that day.

    * (7) The **_annual cap_**, for the care recipient, is the amount determined by the Minister by legislative instrument for the class of care recipients of which the care recipient is a member.

    * (8) The **_lifetime cap_** is the amount determined by the Minister by legislative instrument.

##### 4422  Working out the means tested amount

    * (1) The **_means tested amount_** for the care recipient is worked out as follows:

Means tested amount calculator

    * Work out the **_income tested amount_** using steps 1 to 4:

      * Step 1.	Work out the care recipient's *total assessable income on a yearly basis using section 4424.

      * Step 2.	Work out the care recipient's *total assessable income free area using section 4426.

      * Step 3.	If the care recipient's total assessable income does not exceed the care recipient's total assessable income free area, the **_income tested amount_** is zero.

      * Step 4.	If the care recipient's *total assessable income exceeds the care recipient's total assessable income free area, the **_income tested amount_** is 50% of that excess divided by 364.

    * Work out the **_per day asset tested amount _**using steps 5 to 10:

      * Step 5.	Work out the value of the care recipient's assets using section 4426A.

      * Step 6.	If the value of the care recipient's assets does not exceed the **_asset free area_**, the **_asset tested amount_** is zero.

      * Step 7.	If the value of the care recipient's assets exceeds the **_asset free area_** but not the **_first asset threshold_**, the **_asset tested amount_** is 17.5% of the excess.

      * Step 8.	If the value of the care recipient's assets exceeds the first asset threshold but not the **_second asset threshold_**, the **_asset tested amount_** is the sum of the following:

        * (a) 1% of the excess;

        * (b) 17.5% of the difference between the asset free area and the first asset threshold.

      * Step 9.	If the value of the care recipient's assets exceeds the second asset threshold, the **_asset tested amount_** is the sum of the following:

        * (a) 2% of the excess;

        * (b) 1% of the difference between the first asset threshold and the second asset threshold;

        * (c) 17.5% of the difference between the asset free area and the first asset threshold.

      * Step 10.	The **_per day asset tested amount _**is the asset tested amount divided by 364.

    * The **_means tested amount_** is the sum of the income tested amount and the per day asset tested amount.

    * (2) The **_asset free area_** is:

     * (a) the amount equal to 2.25 times the *basic age pension amount; or

     * (b) such other amount as is calculated in accordance with the Subsidy Principles.

    * (3) The **_first asset threshold_** and the **_second asset threshold_** are the amounts determined by the Minister by legislative instrument.

##### 4423  Care subsidy reduction taken to be zero in some circumstances

    * (1) The care subsidy reduction in respect of the care recipient is taken to be zero for each day, during the *payment period, on which one or more of the following applies:

     * (b) a determination was in force under subsection (2) in relation to the care recipient;

     * (c) the care recipient was included in a class of people specified in the Subsidy Principles.

    * (2) The Secretary may, in accordance with the Subsidy Principles, determine that the care subsidy reduction in respect of the care recipient is to be taken to be zero.

    * (3) The determination ceases to be in force at the end of the period (if any) specified in the determination.

        * Note: Decisions specifying periods are reviewable under Part 6.1.

    * (4) In deciding whether to make a determination, the Secretary must have regard to the matters specified in the Subsidy Principles.

    * (2) The Subsidy Principles may specify care that:

     * (a) constitutes home care for the purposes of this Act; or

     * (b) does not constitute home care for the purposes of this Act.

#### Division 46--Who is eligible for home care subsidy?

##### 461  Eligibility for home care subsidy

    * (1) An approved provider is eligible for *home care subsidy in respect of a day if the Secretary is satisfied that, during that day:

     * (a) the approved provider holds an allocation of *places for *home care subsidy that is in force under Part 2.2 (other than a *provisional allocation); and

     * (b) there is in force a *home care agreement under which a care recipient approved under Part 2.3 in respect of home care is to be provided with home care by the approved provider, whether or not the care is to be provided on that day; and

     * (c) the approved provider provides the care recipient with such home care (if any) as is required under the home care agreement.

    * (2) However, the approved provider is not eligible for *home care subsidy if the *home care agreement is excluded on that day because the approved provider exceeds the approved provider's allocation of *places for home care subsidy (see section 463).

        * Note: Eligibility may also be affected by Division 7 (relating to a person's approval as a provider of *aged care services) or Division 20 (relating to a person's approval as a recipient of home care).

##### 462  Suspension of home care services

    * (1) A care recipient who is being provided with home care by an approved provider in accordance with a *home care agreement may request the approved provider to suspend, on a temporary basis, the provision of that home care, commencing on a date specified in the request.

    * (2) The approved provider must comply with the request.

    * (3) The Subsidy Principles may specify requirements relating to the suspension, on a temporary basis, of home care.

##### 463  Exceeding the number of places for which there is an allocation

    * (1) For the purposes of an approved provider's eligibility for *home care subsidy, a *home care agreement to provide home care to a particular care recipient on a particular day is excluded if:

     * (a) the number of care recipients in respect of whom the approved provider has, during that day, home care agreements to provide home care exceeds the number of *places included in the approved provider's allocation of places for home care subsidy; and

     * (b) the Secretary decides, in accordance with subsection (2), that the home care agreement is to be excluded on that day.

    * (2) In deciding under paragraph (1)(b) which *home care agreements are to be excluded, the Secretary must:

     * (a) make the number of exclusions necessary to ensure that the number of *places for which *home care subsidy will be payable does not exceed the number of places included in the approved provider's allocation of places for home care subsidy; and

     * (b) exclude the home care agreements in the reverse order in which the care recipients in question *entered the home care service for the provision of home care.

##### 464  Notice of refusal to pay home care subsidy

    * (1) If:

     * (a) an approved provider has claimed *home care subsidy in respect of a person; and

     * (b) the approved provider is not eligible for home care subsidy in respect of that person;

    * the Secretary must, within 28 days after receiving the claim, notify the approved provider in writing accordingly.

    * (2) A notice given under subsection (1) is not a legislative instrument.

#### Division 47--On what basis is home care subsidy paid?

##### 471  Payability of home care subsidy

    * (1) *Home care subsidy is payable by the Commonwealth to an approved provider in respect of each *payment period (see section 472) during which the approved provider is eligible under section 461. However, it is not payable in respect of any days during that period on which the approved provider is not eligible.

    * (2) *Home care subsidy is separately payable by the Commonwealth in respect of each home care service through which an approved provider provides home care.

##### 472  Meaning of payment period

    * A **_payment period_** is:

     * (a) a calendar month; or

     * (b) such other period as is set out in the Subsidy Principles.

##### 473  Advances

    * (1) Subject to subsection 474(2), *home care subsidy is payable by the Commonwealth in advance, in respect of a *payment period, at such times as the Secretary thinks fit.

    * (2) The Secretary must work out the amount of an advance to be paid to an approved provider in respect of the first *payment period for a home care service by estimating the amount of *home care subsidy that will be payable for the days in that period and in the following payment period.

    * (3) The Secretary must work out the amount of an advance to be paid to an approved provider in respect of subsequent *payment periods for a home care service by:

     * (a) estimating the amount of *home care subsidy that will be payable for the days in the period; and

     * (b) increasing or reducing that amount to make any adjustments that the Secretary reasonably believes are necessary to take account of likely underpayments or overpayments in respect of advances previously paid under this section.

    * (4) The amounts of advances must be worked out in accordance with any requirements set out in the Subsidy Principles.

##### 474  Claims for home care subsidy

    * (1) For the purpose of obtaining payment of *home care subsidy in respect of a home care service through which an approved provider provides home care, the approved provider must, as soon as practicable after the end of each *payment period, give to the Secretary:

     * (a) a claim, in the form approved by the Secretary, for home care subsidy that is, or may become, payable in respect of the service for that payment period; and

     * (b) any information relating to the claim that is stated in the form to be required, or that the Secretary requests.

    * (2) An advance of *home care subsidy is not payable in respect of a *payment period for the home care service if the approved provider has not given to the Secretary, under subsection (1), a claim relating to the second last preceding payment period for the service.

        * Example: An advance of subsidy is not payable for March if the Secretary has not been given a claim for January of the same year (assuming the *payment periods are all calendar months--see section 472).

    * (3) Subsection (2) does not apply to the first *payment period or the second payment period for a home care service.

##### 474A  Variations of claims for home care subsidy

    * (1) An approved provider may vary the claim made in respect of a *payment period within:

     * (a) 2 years after the end of that payment period; or

     * (b) such longer period as is determined in respect of the claim by the Secretary.

    * (2) In determining a longer period for the purposes of paragraph (1)(b), the Secretary must be satisfied that a variation is required:

     * (a) due to an administrative error made by the Commonwealth or an agent of the Commonwealth; or

     * (b) because the Commonwealth or an agent of the Commonwealth considers that the circumstances of a care recipient are different from those on the basis of which subsidy was claimed.

        * Note: Determinations of periods under paragraph (1)(b) are reviewable under Part 6.1.

    * (3) A determination made under paragraph (1)(b) is not a legislative instrument.

##### 475  Recovery of overpayments

    * This Division does not affect the Commonwealth's right to recover overpayments under Part 6.5.

#### Division 48--What is the amount of home care subsidy?

##### 481  Amount of home care subsidy

    * (1) The amount of *home care subsidy payable to an approved provider for a home care service in respect of a *payment period is the amount worked out by adding together the amounts of home care subsidy for each care recipient:

     * (a) in respect of whom there is in force a *home care agreement for provision of home care provided through the service during the period; and

     * (b) in respect of whom the approved provider was eligible for home care subsidy during the period.

    * (2) This is how to work out the amount of *home care subsidy for a care recipient in respect of the *payment period.

Home care subsidy calculator

      * Step 1.	Work out the **_basic subsidy amount_** using section 482.

      * Step 2.	Add to this amount the amounts of any **_primary supplements_** worked out using section 483.

      * Step 3.	Subtract the amounts of any **_reductions in subsidy_** worked out using section 484.

      * Step 4.	Add the amounts of any **_other supplements_** worked out using section 489.

    * The result is the **_amount of home care subsidy_** for the care recipient in respect of the *payment period.

##### 482  The basic subsidy amount

    * (1) The **_basic subsidy amount_** for the care recipient in respect of the *payment period is the sum of all the basic subsidy amounts for the days during the period on which the care recipient was provided with home care through the home care service in question.

    * (2) The basic subsidy amount for a day is the amount determined by the Minister by legislative instrument.

    * (3) The Minister may determine different amounts (including nil amounts) based on any one or more of the following:

     * (a) the levels for care recipients being provided with home care;

     * (b) any other matters specified in the Subsidy Principles;

     * (c) any other matters determined by the Minister.

##### 483  Primary supplements

    * (1) The **_primary supplements_** for the care recipient under step 2 of the home care subsidy calculator are such of the following primary supplements as apply to the care recipient in respect of the *payment period:

     * (a) the following primary supplements as set out in the Subsidy Principles:

      * (i) the oxygen supplement;

      * (ii) the enteral feeding supplement;

      * (iii) the dementia and cognition supplement;

      * (iv) the veterans' supplement;

     * (b) any other primary supplement set out in the Subsidy Principles for the purposes of this paragraph.

    * (2) The Subsidy Principles may specify, in respect of each primary supplement, the circumstances in which the supplement will apply to a care recipient in respect of a *payment period.

    * (3) The Minister may determine by legislative instrument, in respect of each such supplement, the amount of the supplement, or the way in which the amount of the supplement is to be worked out.

##### 484  Reductions in subsidy

    * The **_reductions in subsidy_** for the care recipient under step 3 of the home care subsidy calculator are such of the following reductions as apply to the care recipient in respect of the *payment period:

     * (a) the compensation payment reduction (see sections 485 and 486);

     * (b) the care subsidy reduction (see sections 487 and 488).

##### 485  The compensation payment reduction

    * (1) The **_compensation payment reduction_** for the care recipient in respect of the *payment period is the sum of all compensation payment reductions for days during the period:

     * (a) on which the care recipient is provided with home care through the home care service in question; and

     * (b) that are covered by a compensation entitlement.

    * (2) For the purposes of this section, a day is covered by a compensation entitlement if:

     * (a) the care recipient is entitled to compensation under a judgement, settlement or reimbursement arrangement; and

     * (b) the compensation takes into account the cost of providing home care to the care recipient on that day; and

     * (c) the application of compensation payment reductions to the care recipient for preceding days has not resulted in reductions in subsidy that, in total, exceed or equal the part of the compensation that relates, or is to be treated under subsection (5) or (6) as relating, to future costs of providing home care.

    * (3) The compensation payment reduction for a particular day is an amount equal to the amount of *home care subsidy that would be payable for the care recipient in respect of the *payment period if:

     * (a) the care recipient was provided with home care on that day only; and

     * (b) this section and sections 489 and 4810 did not apply.

    * (4) However, if:

     * (a) the compensation payment reduction arises from a judgement or settlement that fixes the amount of compensation on the basis that liability should be apportioned between the care recipient and the compensation payer; and

     * (b) as a result, the amount of compensation is less than it would have been if liability had not been so apportioned; and

     * (c) the compensation is not paid in a lump sum;

    * the amount of the compensation payment reduction under subsection (3) is reduced by the proportion corresponding to the proportion of liability that is apportioned to the care recipient by the judgement or settlement.

    * (5) If a care recipient is entitled to compensation under a judgement or settlement that does not take into account the future costs of providing home care to the care recipient, the Secretary may, in accordance with the Subsidy Principles, determine:

     * (a) that, for the purposes of this section, the judgement or settlement is to be treated as having taken into account the cost of providing that home care; and

     * (b) the part of the compensation that, for the purposes of this section, is to be treated as relating to the future costs of providing home care.

        * Note: Determinations are reviewable under Part 6.1.

    * (6) If:

     * (a) a care recipient is entitled to compensation under a settlement; and

     * (b) the settlement takes into account the future costs of providing home care to the recipient; and

     * (c) the Secretary is satisfied that the settlement does not adequately take into account the future costs of providing home care to the care recipient;

    * the Secretary may, in accordance with the Subsidy Principles, determine the part of the compensation that, for the purposes of this section, is to be treated as relating to the future costs of providing home care.

        * Note: Determinations are reviewable under Part 6.1.

    * (7) A determination under subsection (5) or (6) must be in writing and notice of it must be given to the care recipient.

    * (8) A determination under subsection (5) or (6) is not a legislative instrument.

    * (9) In this section, the following terms have the same meanings as in the _Health and Other Services (Compensation) Act 1995_:

##### 486  Secretary's powers if compensation information is not given

    * (1) This section applies if:

     * (a) the Secretary believes on reasonable grounds that a care recipient is entitled to compensation under a judgement, settlement or reimbursement arrangement; and

     * (b) the Secretary does not have sufficient information to apply section 485 in relation to the compensation.

    * (2) The Secretary may, by notice in writing given to a person, require the person to give information or produce a document that is in the person's custody, or under the person's control, if the Secretary believes on reasonable grounds that the information or document may be relevant to the application of section 485 in relation to the compensation.

    * (3) The notice must specify:

     * (a) how the person is to give the information or produce the document; and

     * (b) the period within which the person is to give the information or produce the document.

        * Note: Sections 28A and 29 of the _Acts Interpretation Act 1901_ (which deal with service of documents) apply to notice given under this section.

    * (4) If the information or document is not given or produced within the specified period, the Secretary may determine compensation payment reductions for the care recipient.

        * Note: Decisions to determine compensation payment reductions under this section are reviewable under Part 6.1.

    * (5) The compensation payment reductions must be determined in accordance with the Subsidy Principles.

##### 487  The care subsidy reduction

    * (1) The care subsidy reduction for the care recipient for the *payment period is the sum of all the care subsidy reductions for days during the period on which the care recipient is provided with home care through the home care service in question.

    * (2) Subject to this section and section 488, the care subsidy reduction for a particular day is worked out as follows:

Care subsidy reduction calculator

      * Step 1.	Work out the care recipient's **_total assessable income_** on a yearly basis using section 4424.

      * Step 2.	Work out the care recipient's **_total assessable income free area_** using section 4426.

      * Step 3.	If the care recipient's total assessable income does not exceed the care recipient's total assessable income free area, the **_care subsidy reduction_** is zero.

      * Step 4.	If the care recipient's total assessable income exceeds the care recipient's total assessable income free area but not the **_income threshold_**, the **_care subsidy reduction_** is equal to the lowest of the following:

        * (a) the sum of the basic subsidy amount for the care recipient and all primary supplements for the care recipient;

        * (b) 50% of the amount by which the care recipient's total assessable income exceeds the income free area (worked out on a per day basis);

        * (c) the amount (the **_first cap_**) determined by the Minister by legislative instrument for the purposes of this paragraph.

      * Step 5.	If the care recipient's total assessable income exceeds the **_income threshold_**, the **_care subsidy reduction_** is equal to the lowest of the following:

        * (a) the sum of the basic subsidy amount for the care recipient and all primary supplements for the care recipient;

        * (b) 50% of the amount by which the care recipient's total assessable income exceeds the income threshold (worked out on a per day basis) plus the amount specified in paragraph (c) of step 4;

        * (c) the amount (the **_second cap_**) determined by the Minister by legislative instrument for the purposes of this paragraph.

    * (3) If the care recipient has not provided sufficient information about the care recipient's income for the care recipient's care subsidy reduction to be determined, the **_care subsidy reduction_** is equal to the lesser of the following:

     * (a) the sum of the basic subsidy amount for the care recipient and all primary supplements for the care recipient;

     * (b) the second cap.

    * (4) If, apart from this subsection, the sum of all the *combined care subsidy reductions made for the care recipient during a *startdate year for the care recipient would exceed the annual cap applying at the time for the care recipient, the **_care subsidy reduction_** for the remainder of the startdate year is zero.

    * (5) If, apart from this subsection, the sum of all the previous *combined care subsidy reductions made for the care recipient would exceed the lifetime cap applying at the time, the **_care subsidy reduction_** for the remainder of the care recipient's life is zero.
