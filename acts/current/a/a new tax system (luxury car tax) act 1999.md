#### Division 9--Quoting

##### 91  What this Division is about

##### 95  Quoting

    * (1) You are entitled to *quote your *ABN in relation to a supply of a *luxury car or an *importation of a luxury car if, at the time of quoting, you have the intention of using the car for one of the following purposes, and for no other purpose:

    * (2) If you make a periodic quote on or before the first day of the period to which the quote relates, you are to be treated as having *quoted your *ABN for all supplies from the supplier during that period, other than supplies in respect of which you have notified the supplier in accordance with subsection (3).

    * (3) If you are not entitled to *quote for a particular supply from the supplier during the period, you must notify the supplier of that fact at or before the time of the supply. The notification must be in the *approved form.

    * (4) You are guilty of an offence if you contravene subsection (3).

      * Maximum penalty: 20 penalty units.

        * Note 1: Chapter 2 of the _Criminal Code_ sets out the general principles of criminal responsibility.

        * Note 2: See section 4AA of the _Crimes Act 1914 _for the current value of a penalty unit.

    * (5) Section 925 applies to a *quote that you are treated as having made under subsection (2) of this section for a particular supply.

##### 915  Manner in which quote must be made

    * (1) A *quote (including a periodic quote) must be in the *approved form.

    * (2) A *quote is not effective unless it is made at or before the time of the supply or *importation.

##### 920  Incorrect quote nevertheless effective for certain purposes

    * If you *quote in circumstances in which you are not entitled to quote, or the quote is not in the *approved form, the quote is nevertheless effective for the purpose of subsection 510(2) or 710(3) (whichever is relevant), unless section 925 applies.

##### 925  Quote not effective for certain purposes if there are grounds for believing it was improperly made

    * A *quote is not effective, so far as it would have resulted in you not paying luxury car tax, if at the time of the quote the person to whom the quote is made has reasonable grounds for believing that:

     * (a) you are not entitled to quote in the particular circumstances; or

### Part 3--Paying the luxury car tax

#### Division 13--Paying the luxury car tax

##### 131  What this Division is about

    * Luxury car tax on supplies of luxury cars is added to net amounts under Division 17 of the GST Act. Adjustments in relation to supplies or importations can be made to net amounts. They may increase or decrease net amounts.

    * Luxury car tax on importations of luxury cars is not incorporated into net amounts but is generally paid with customs duty.

        * Note: Division 165 (Antiavoidance) of the GST Act will cover avoidance schemes relating to luxury car tax so far as they affect net amounts, because such schemes affect amounts payable under the GST Act.

##### Subdivision 13A--Net amounts and adjustments

##### 135  Net amounts increased by amounts of luxury car tax

    * Your *net amount for a *tax period is increased by the sum of all of the amounts of luxury car tax (if any) that are attributable to that tax period, other than amounts on *taxable importations of luxury cars.

##### 1310  Adjustments

    * (1) If you have any *luxury car tax adjustments that are attributable to a *tax period applying to you, alter your *net amount for the period as follows:

     * (a) add to that net amount for the period the sum of all the *increasing luxury car tax adjustments (if any) that are attributable to the period;

     * (b) subtract from that net amount the sum of all the *decreasing luxury car tax adjustments (if any) that are attributable to the period.

    * (2) A *luxury car tax adjustment must be made within 4 years after the supply or *importation to which the adjustment relates.

##### 1315  Attribution rules for taxable supplies of luxury cars and luxury car tax adjustments

    * (1) The luxury car tax payable by you on a *taxable supply of a luxury car is attributable to the same *tax period, or tax periods, applying to you as the tax period or tax periods to which:

     * (a) if the *supply is a *taxable supply--the taxable supply is attributable; or

     * (b) if the supply is not a taxable supply--the supply would be attributable if it were a taxable supply.

        * Note: For the basic rules on attribution of taxable supplies, see section 295 of the GST Act.

    * (1A) The luxury car tax payable by you on a *taxable supply of a luxury car that is supplied by way of lease or hire is entirely attributable to the first *tax period to which the supply of the car is attributable. This subsection has effect despite section 1565 of the *GST Act.

        * Note: Under that section, the luxury car tax could otherwise be payable on a periodic basis.

    * (2) A *luxury car tax adjustment that you have is attributable to the same *tax period, or tax periods, applying to you as the tax period or tax periods to which:

     * (a) if the luxury car tax adjustment is an *adjustment--the adjustment is attributable; or

     * (b) if the luxury car tax adjustment is not an adjustment--the luxury car tax adjustment would be attributable if it were an adjustment.

        * Note: For the basic rules on attribution of adjustments, see section 2920 of the GST Act.

##### Subdivision 13B--Paying assessed luxury car tax on taxable importations of luxury cars

##### 1320  Paying assessed luxury car tax on taxable importations of luxury cars

    * (1) *Assessed luxury car tax on a *taxable importation of a luxury car is to be paid by the importer to the Commonwealth:

     * (a) at the same time, at the same place, and in the same manner, as *customs duty is payable on the car in question (or would be payable if the car were subject to customs duty); or

     * (b) in the circumstances specified in the regulations, within such further time specified in the regulations, and at the place and in the manner specified in the regulations.

         * Note 1: The regulations could (for example) allow for deferral of payments to coincide with payments of assessed net amounts.

         * Note 1A: For provisions about assessment of luxury car tax on taxable importations of luxury cars, see Division 155 in Schedule 1 to the _Taxation Administration Act 1953_.

         * Note 2: For provisions about collection and recovery of assessed luxury car tax on taxable importations of luxury cars, see Subdivision 105C, and Part 415, in Schedule 1 to the _Taxation Administration Act 1953_.

    * (2) An officer of Customs (within the meaning of subsection 4(1) of the _Customs Act 1901_) may refuse to deliver the goods concerned unless the assessed luxury car tax has been paid.

##### 1325  Security or undertaking given under section 162 or 162A of the Customs Act

    * (1) An amount of *assessed luxury car tax on a *taxable importation of a luxury car is not payable if:

     * (a) a security or undertaking described in section 162 of the _Customs Act 1901_ has been given; and

        * Note: Section 162 of the _Customs Act 1901_ allows delivery of imported goods if the importer gives a security or undertaking to pay any customs duty, assessed GST and assessed luxury car tax relating to the importation.

    * (1A) An amount of *assessed luxury car tax on a *taxable importation of a luxury car is not payable if:

     * (a) a security or undertaking described in section 162A of the _Customs Act 1901_ has been given; and

     * (b) the car is not dealt with in contravention of regulations made for the purposes of that section; and

     * (c) one or more of the following applies:

      * (i) the car is exported within the relevant period mentioned in paragraph 162A(5)(b) of that Act;

      * (ii) if the car is goods described in subsection 162A(5A) of that Act--the goods are exported before the end of the relevant day mentioned in paragraph 162A(5A)(b) of that Act;

      * (iii) one or more of the circumstances or conditions specified in the regulations mentioned in paragraph 162A(5)(b) of that Act apply in relation to the car.

        * Note: Section 162A of the _Customs Act 1901_ allows delivery of imported goods if the importer gives a security or undertaking to pay any customs duty, assessed GST and assessed luxury car tax relating to the importation.

    * (2) This section has effect despite section 1320.

##### 1330  Application of Division 165 of the GST Act

    * Division 165 of the *GST Act applies to amounts payable under this Subdivision as if they were amounts payable under the GST Act.

#### Division 15--Adjustments

##### 151  What this Division is about

    * Circumstances that occur after the supply or importation of a car may mean that too much or too little luxury car tax was imposed. Accordingly, adjustments are made to increase or decrease the net amount. Adjustments can be made by the supplier, the recipient or the importer, depending upon the circumstances.

##### Subdivision 15A--General adjustments

##### 155  Luxury car tax adjustment event

    * (1) A **_luxury car tax adjustment event_** is any event which has the effect of:

     * (a) cancelling a supply of a *luxury car; or

     * (b) changing the *consideration for the supply; or

     * (c) causing the supply to become, or stop being, a *taxable supply of a luxury car.

    * (2) Without limiting subsection (1), these are *luxury car tax adjustment events:

     * (a) the return to a supplier of a *car supplied (whether or not the return involves a change of ownership of the car);

     * (b) a change to the previously agreed *consideration for a supply of a car, whether due to the offer of a discount or otherwise.

    * (3) A *luxury car tax adjustment event can arise in relation to a supply of a *car even if it is not a *taxable supply of a luxury car.

    * (4) However, the return of a *luxury car to its supplier is not an *adjustment event if the return is for the purpose of repair or maintenance.

##### 1510  Where adjustments for luxury car tax arise

    * You have a **_luxury car tax adjustment_** for a supply of a *luxury car for which you are liable to pay luxury car tax (or would be liable to pay luxury car tax if it were a *taxable supply of a luxury car) if:

     * (a) in relation to the supply, one or more *luxury car tax adjustment events occur during a *tax period; and

     * (b) luxury car tax on the supply was attributable to an earlier tax period (or, if the supply was not a taxable supply of a luxury car, would have been attributable to an earlier tax period had the supply been a taxable supply of a luxury car); and

     * (c) as a result of that adjustment event or those adjustment events, the *previously attributed luxury car tax amount for the supply no longer correctly reflects the amount of luxury car tax on the supply (the **_corrected luxury car tax amount_**), taking into account any luxury car tax adjustments for the supply.

##### 1515  Previously attributed luxury car tax amounts

    * The **_previously attributed luxury car tax amount_** for a supply of a *luxury car is:

     * (a) the amount of any luxury car tax that was attributable to a *tax period in respect of the supply; plus

     * (b) the sum of any *increasing luxury car tax adjustments, under this Subdivision, that were previously attributable to a tax period in respect of the supply; minus

     * (c) the sum of any *decreasing luxury car tax adjustments, under this Subdivision, that were previously attributable to a tax period in respect of the supply.

##### 1520  Increasing adjustments for supplies

    * If the *corrected luxury car tax amount is _greater_ than the *previously attributed luxury car tax amount, you have an **_increasing luxury car tax adjustment_** equal to the difference between the corrected luxury car tax amount and the previously attributed luxury car tax amount.

##### 1525  Decreasing adjustments for supplies

    * If the *corrected luxury car tax amount is _less_ than the *previously attributed luxury car tax amount, you have a **_decreasing luxury car tax adjustment_** equal to the difference between the previously attributed luxury car tax amount and the corrected luxury car tax amount.

##### Subdivision 15B--Change of use adjustments

##### 1530  Changes of use--supplies of luxury cars

    * (1) You have a **_decreasing luxury car tax adjustment_** if:

     * (c) you were *registered at the time of the supply; and

     * (d) you intend to use the car for a *quotable purpose; and

     * (e) you have only used the car for a quotable purpose.

    * (2) The *decreasing luxury car tax adjustment is equal to the amount of luxury car tax that was payable on the supply.

    * (4) The *increasing luxury car tax adjustment is equal to:

     * (a) the amount of luxury car tax that the supplier of the car would have had to pay if you had not *quoted for the supply; or

     * (b) the amount of the *decreasing luxury car tax adjustment;

    * whichever is relevant.

##### 1535  Changes of use--importing luxury cars

    * (1) You have a **_decreasing luxury car tax adjustment_** if:

     * (a) you *imported a *luxury car; and

     * (b) luxury car tax was payable on the importation because you did not *quote for the importation; and

     * (c) you were *registered at the time of the importation; and

     * (d) you intend to use the car for a *quotable purpose; and

     * (e) you have only used the car for a quotable purpose.

    * (2) The *decreasing luxury car tax adjustment is equal to the amount of luxury car tax that was payable on the importation.

    * (3) You have an **_increasing luxury car tax adjustment_** if

    * whichever is relevant.

     * (c) you write off as bad the whole or a part of the debt, or the whole or a part of the debt has been *overdue for 12 months or more.

    * (2) The decreasing luxury car tax adjustment is equal to:

     * (a) the amount of luxury car tax that was payable by you on the supply taking into account any previous *luxury car tax adjustments for the supply; minus

     * (b) the amount of luxury car tax (if any) that would be payable if the *price of the supply of the car (disregarding any previous *luxury car tax adjustments for the supply) was reduced by an amount equal to the sum of:

      * (i) the amount or amounts of the debt written off as bad; and

      * (ii) the amount of the debt that has been *overdue for 12 months or more (other than amounts already written off).

     * (a) you made a *taxable supply of a luxury car in relation to which you had a *decreasing luxury car tax adjustment under section 1540 for a debt; and

     * (b) you recover the whole or a part of the amount or amounts of the debt that have been written off as bad or *overdue for 12 months or more.

    * (2) The increasing luxury car tax adjustment is equal to:

#### Division 16--GST groups and GST joint ventures

##### 161  What this Division is about

    * The representative member of a GST group deals with all of the luxury car tax liabilities and entitlements of the group. The joint venture operator of a GST joint venture deals with the luxury car tax liabilities and entitlements arising from the operator's dealings on behalf of the other participants in the joint venture.

##### Subdivision 16A--Members of GST groups

##### 165  Who is liable for luxury car tax

    * (1) Luxury car tax payable on a *taxable supply of a luxury car, or a *taxable importation of a luxury car, for which a *member of a *GST group would (apart from this section) be liable:

     * (a) is payable by the *representative member; and

     * (b) is not payable by the member that would otherwise be liable (unless the member is the representative member).

    * (2) However, if the member is not the *representative member of the *GST group, this section only applies to luxury car tax payable on a *taxable importation of a luxury car if the tax is payable at a time when luxury car tax on *taxable supplies of luxury cars is normally payable by the representative member.

    * (3) This section has effect despite sections 55 and 75 (which are about liability for luxury car tax).

##### 1610  Luxury car tax adjustments

    * (1) Any *luxury car tax adjustment that a *member of a *GST group has is to be treated as if:

     * (a) is payable by the joint venture operator; and

     * (b) is not payable by the other participant.

    * (2) This section has effect despite sections 55 and 75 (which are about liability for luxury car tax).

##### 1620  Luxury car tax adjustments

    * (1) Any *luxury car tax adjustment relating to any supply or *importation that the *joint venture operator of a *GST joint venture makes, on behalf of another *participant in the joint venture, in the course of activities for which the joint venture was entered into is to be treated as if:

     * (a) the other participant did not have the adjustment; and

     * (b) the joint venture operator had the adjustment.

    * (2) This section has effect despite section 1310 (which is about the effect of *luxury car tax adjustments on net amounts).

##### 1625  Additional net amounts relating to GST joint ventures

    * The additional net amount relating to a *GST joint venture in section 5145 of the *GST Act:

     * (a) is increased by the amount of any luxury car tax on *taxable supplies of luxury cars for which the *joint venture operator is liable because of section 1615; and

#### Division 17--Credits

##### 171  What this Division is about

    * You may, in some circumstances, be able to claim a credit for luxury car tax paid either by yourself or by the supplier of the luxury car. Credits are only available to people who are not entitled to an adjustment for the circumstance.

##### 175  Credits for tax borne

    * (1) You are entitled to a credit if:

     * (a) you have a credit entitlement under this section; and

     * (b) you are not *registered or *required to be registered; and

     * (c) no one else has made a valid claim for a credit in relation to the credit entitlement.

    * (2) You have a credit entitlement if:

     * (a) luxury car tax on a supply to you was overpaid (that is, the supplier paid an amount of luxury car tax that was not legally payable); and

     * (b) you have *borne the overpaid luxury car tax.

    * (3) You have a credit entitlement if you have *borne luxury car tax on a supply of a *car for which you could have *quoted except that you were not *registered at the time of the supply.

    * (4) You have a credit entitlement if you have paid luxury car tax on the *importation of a *luxury car for which you could have *quoted except that you were not *registered at the time of the importation.

    * (5) The amount of the credit is the amount of:

     * (a) overpaid luxury car tax *borne by you; or

     * (b) luxury car tax that would not have been payable by the supplier had you *quoted for the supply in question and that was borne by you; or

     * (c) luxury car tax that you would not have paid had you quoted for the *importation in question;

    * but only to the extent that you have not *passed on that amount or have not already been credited in respect of that amount.

        * Note: The main effect of treating the amount as if it were luxury car tax is to apply the collection and recovery rules in Part 310 in Schedule 1 to the _Taxation Administration Act 1953_, such as a liability to pay the general interest charge under section 10580 in that Schedule.
