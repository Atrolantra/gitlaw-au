    * In this Act:

    * **_approved provider_** has the meaning given by the Dictionary in Schedule 1 to the _Aged Care Act 1997_.

    * **_costs recoupment determination_** means:

     * (a) a refund costs recoupment determination within the meaning of the _Aged Care (Accommodation Payment Security) Act 2006_; or

     * (b) an administrative costs recoupment determination within the meaning of that Act.

    * **_default event declaration_** has the same meaning as in the _Aged Care (Accommodation Payment Security) Act 2006_.

    * **_levy_** means levy imposed by regulations under section 6.

    * **_outstanding accommodation payment balance_** has the same meaning as in the _Aged Care (Accommodation Payment Security) Act 2006_.

##### 6  Regulations may impose levy

    * (1) If a costs recoupment determination specifying a default event declaration has been made, the regulations may impose a levy in respect of the refund obligations of approved providers relating to the default event declaration.

    * (2) For the purposes of subsection (1), the **_refund obligations of approved providers_** relating to a default event declaration is the set of obligations that the approved providers would have had, at the start of the day that was 10 days before the day on which the default event declaration was made, to refund accommodation payment balances if it were assumed that at that time the accommodation payment balances became outstanding accommodation payment balances.

##### 7  Rate of levy

    * The rate of the levy is worked out in accordance with the regulations.

##### 8  Maximum rate of levy
