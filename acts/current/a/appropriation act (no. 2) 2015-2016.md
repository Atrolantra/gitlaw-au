    * This Act may be cited as the _Appropriation Act (No. 2) 20152016_.

##### 2  Commencement

    * This Act commences on the day this Act receives the Royal Assent.

##### 3  Definitions

    * In this Act: 

    * **_acquisition_** has the same meaning as in the GST Act.

    * **_administered assets and liabilities item_** means an amount set out in Schedule 2 in relation to a noncorporate entity opposite the heading "Administered Assets and Liabilities".

    * **_administered item_** means an amount set out in Schedule 2 opposite an outcome for a noncorporate entity under the heading "New Administered Outcomes".

    * **_corporate entity_** means:

     * (a) a corporate Commonwealth entity within the meaning of the _Public Governance, Performance and Accountability Act 2013_; or

     * (b) a Commonwealth company within the meaning of that Act.

    * **_corporate entity item_** means the amount set out in Schedule 2 in relation to a corporate entity under the heading "Nonoperating".

    * **_current year_** means the financial year ending on 30 June 2016.

    * **_expenditure_** means payments for expenses, acquiring assets, making loans or paying liabilities.

    * **_Finance Minister_** means the Minister administering this Act.

    * **_GST Act_** means the _A New Tax System (Goods and Services Tax) Act 1999_, as it applies because of Division 177 of that Act.

       * Note: Under Division 177 of the GST Act, that Act applies notionally to the Commonwealth and Commonwealth entities. They are therefore notionally liable to pay GST, are notionally entitled to input tax credits and notionally have adjustments.

    * **_GST qualifying amount_** means:

     * (a) an input tax credit (within the meaning of the GST Act); or

     * (b) a decreasing adjustment (within the meaning of the GST Act).

    * **_importation_** has the same meaning as in the GST Act.

    * **_item_** means any of the following:

     * (a) a State, ACT, NT and local government item;

     * (b) an administered item;

     * (c) an administered assets and liabilities item;

     * (d) an other departmental item;

     * (e) a corporate entity item.

    * **_noncorporate entity_** means:

     * (a) a noncorporate Commonwealth entity within the meaning of the _Public Governance, Performance and Accountability Act 2013_; or

     * (b) the High Court.

    * **_other departmental item_** means an amount set out in Schedule 2 in relation to a noncorporate entity opposite the heading "Equity Injections".

    * **_Portfolio Budget Statements_** means the Portfolio Budget Statements that were tabled in the Senate or the House of Representatives in relation to the Bill for this Act.

    * **_portfolio statements_** means the Portfolio Budget Statements.

    * **_special account_** has the same meaning as in the _Public Governance, Performance and Accountability Act 2013_.

    * **_State, ACT, NT and local government item_** means an amount set out in Schedule 2 opposite an outcome for a noncorporate entity under the heading "Payments to States, ACT, NT and local government".

##### 4  Portfolio statements

    * The portfolio statements are declared to be relevant documents for the purposes of section 15AB of the _Acts Interpretation Act 1901_.

       * Note: See paragraph 15AB(2)(g) of the _Acts Interpretation Act 1901_ which provides that the material that may be considered in the interpretation of a provision of an Act includes any document that is declared by the Act to be a relevant document.

##### 5  Notional transactions between entities that are part of the Commonwealth

    * For the purposes of this Act, notional transactions between noncorporate entities are to be treated as if they were real transactions.

       * Note: This section applies, for example, to a "payment" between noncorporate entities that are both part of the Commonwealth. One of the effects of this section is that the payment will be debited from an appropriation for the paying noncorporate entity, even though no payment is actually made from the Consolidated Revenue Fund. This is consistent with section 76 of the _Public Governance, Performance and Accountability Act 2013_.

### Part 2--Appropriation items

##### 6  Summary of appropriations

    * The total of the items specified in Schedule 2 is $15,005,358,000.

##### 7  State, ACT, NT and local government items

    * (1) The amount specified in a State, ACT, NT and local government item for an outcome for a noncorporate entity may be applied for the purpose of making payments to or for the States, the Australian Capital Territory, the Northern Territory and local government authorities for the purpose of contributing to achieving that outcome.

    * (2) If the portfolio statements indicate that activities of a particular kind were intended to be treated as activities in respect of a particular outcome, then expenditure for the purpose of carrying out those activities is taken to be expenditure for the purpose of contributing to achieving the outcome.

##### 8  Administered items

    * (1) The amount specified in an administered item for an outcome for a noncorporate entity may be applied for expenditure for the purpose of contributing to achieving that outcome.

    * (2) If the portfolio statements indicate that activities of a particular kind were intended to be treated as activities in respect of a particular outcome, then expenditure for the purpose of carrying out those activities is taken to be expenditure for the purpose of contributing to achieving the outcome.

##### 9  Administered assets and liabilities items

    * (1) The amount specified in an administered assets and liabilities item for a noncorporate entity may be applied for expenditure for the purpose of contributing to achieving any outcome specified for the entity:

    * (2) If the portfolio statements indicate that activities of a particular kind were intended to be treated as activities in respect of a particular outcome, then expenditure for the purpose of carrying out those activities is taken to be expenditure for the purpose of contributing to achieving the outcome.

     * (b) because the expenditure was unforeseen until after the last day on which it was practicable to provide for it in the Bill for this Act before that Bill was introduced into the House of Representatives.

    * (2) This Act has effect as if Schedule 2 were amended, in accordance with a determination of the Finance Minister, to make provision for so much (if any) of the expenditure as the Finance Minister determines.

    * (3) The total of the amounts determined under subsection (2) cannot be more than $380 million.
