    * (2) Except in the case of records exempted from transfer to the care of the Archives by virtue of a determination under section 29, an examination of records for the purposes of subsection (1) shall be conducted on premises of the Archives.

    * (1) Nothing in this Act shall be taken to require the Archives to give information as to the existence or nonexistence of a record where information as to the existence or nonexistence of that record, if included in a Commonwealth record, would cause that lastmentioned record to be an exempt record by virtue of paragraph 33(1)(a), (b) or (e).

     * (a) section 40 applies as if the decision to give such a notice were a decision referred to in that section; and

     * (b) the decision to give the notice shall, for the purposes of Division 4, be deemed to be a decision of the Archives refusing to grant the applicant access to the record on the ground that the record is an exempt record under paragraph 33(1)(a), (b) or (e), as the case may be.
