### Part 2--Appropriation items

##### 6  Summary of appropriations

    * The total of the items specified in Schedule 1 is $267,980,000.

       * Note 1: Items in Schedule 1 can be adjusted under Part 3 of this Act.

       * Note 2: Sections 30 to 32 of the _Financial Management and Accountability Act 1997_ also provide for adjustments of amounts appropriated by this Act.

##### 7  Administered assets and liabilities items

    * (1) The amount specified in an administered assets and liabilities item for an Agency may be applied for expenditure for the purpose of contributing to achieving any outcome specified for the Agency:

      * (a) in Schedule 1 to this Act; or

      * (b) in Schedule 1 to the _Appropriation (Implementation of the Report of the Expert Panel on Asylum Seekers) Act (No. 1) 2012-2013_; or

       * Note: The Finance Minister manages the expenditure of public money through the issue of drawing rights under the _Financial Management and Accountability Act 1997_.

    * (2) If the Portfolio Statements indicate that activities of a particular kind were intended to be treated as activities in respect of a particular outcome, then expenditure for the purpose of carrying out those activities is taken to be expenditure for the purpose of contributing to achieving the outcome.

##### 8  Other departmental items

    * The amount specified in an other departmental item for an Agency may be applied for the departmental expenditure of the Agency.

       * Note: The Finance Minister manages the expenditure of public money through the issue of drawing rights under the _Financial Management and Accountability Act 1997_.
       * 


### Part 3--Adjusting appropriation items

##### 9  Reducing administered assets and liabilities items and other departmental items

    * (1) A written request to reduce an administered assets and liabilities item or an other departmental item for an Agency may be made to the Finance Minister by:

      * (a) the Prime Minister or a Minister acting on behalf of the Prime Minister; or

      * (b) the Minister who is responsible for the Agency; or

      * (c) if the Finance Minister is responsible for the Agency--the Chief Executive of the Agency.

    * (2) If a request is made under subsection (1), the Finance Minister may, by writing, determine that the item is to be reduced by the amount specified in the request.

    * (3) However, the determination has no effect to the extent that it would reduce the item below nil, after subtracting amounts that have been applied under Part 2 in respect of the item.

    * (4) The item is taken to be reduced in accordance with the determination.

    * (5) Despite subsection 33(3) of the _Acts Interpretation Act 1901_, the determination must not be rescinded, revoked, amended or varied.

    * (6) A request made under subsection (1) is not a legislative instrument.

    * (7) A determination made under subsection (2) is a legislative instrument and, despite subsection 44(2) of the _Legislative Instruments Act 2003_, section 42 (disallowance) of that Act applies to the determination. However, Part 6 (sunsetting) of that Act does not apply to the determination.

### Part 4--Miscellaneous

##### 10  Crediting amounts to Special Accounts

    * If any of the purposes of a Special Account is a purpose that is covered by an item (whether or not the item expressly refers to the Special Account), then amounts may be debited against the appropriation for that item and credited to that Special Account.

##### 11  Appropriation of the Consolidated Revenue Fund
