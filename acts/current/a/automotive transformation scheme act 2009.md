#### Division 2--Assistance

##### Subdivision A--Assistance available

##### 7  Kinds of assistance

    * Assistance under the Automotive Transformation Scheme is of two kinds: 

     * (a) capped assistance; and

     * (b) uncapped assistance.

##### 8  Amount of capped assistance available

    * (1) The total amount of capped assistance under the Automotive Transformation Scheme must not exceed:

     * (a) for stage 1--$1.5 billion; and

     * (b) for stage 2--$1 billion.

    * (2) Subject to subsection (3), the total amount of capped assistance paid in respect of a year must not exceed $300 million.

    * (3) However, if the total amount of capped assistance paid in respect of a particular year is less than $300 million, the balance may be paid as capped assistance in respect of any later year within the relevant stage.

        * Example: If the total amount of capped assistance paid in respect of the year beginning on 1 January 2012 is $270 million, the amount of capped assistance available in respect of the year beginning on 1 January 2013 is $330 million.

        * Note: Except for recovered amounts (dealt with under subsection (6)), capped assistance cannot be carried forward from stage 1 to stage 2.

    * (4) Subject to subsection (6), an amount of capped assistance in respect of a year must not be paid on or after 1 April in the following year.

    * (5) For the purposes of subsections (1) to (3), an amount of capped assistance recovered by the Commonwealth is treated as if it had never been paid.

    * (6) To the extent that the balance referred to in subsection (3) consists of amounts of capped assistance recovered by the Commonwealth during the last year of a stage, the balance may be paid in the year following the last year of that stage. For the purposes of subsections (1) and (2), such a payment is taken to have been made in respect of the last year of that stage.

##### Subdivision B--Payments of assistance

##### 9  Payments

    * Making payments

    * (1) The Automotive Transformation Scheme must provide that a payment of capped or uncapped assistance to an ATS participant may only be made:

     * (a) on the condition that all or part of the payment may be offset or recovered by the Commonwealth in the manner and in the circumstances provided for by the Scheme; and

     * (b) on any other conditions provided for by the Scheme.

    * Recovering payments

    * (2) Without limiting paragraph (1)(a), the Scheme may provide that all or part of a payment of capped or uncapped assistance to an ATS participant may be recovered by the Commonwealth from a person or entity who owes, or may later owe, money to the ATS participant.

##### Subdivision C--Miscellaneous

##### 10  Appropriation
