# Appropriation (Parliamentary Departments) Act (No. 2) 2014-2015

#### No. 30, 2015

##### [Assented to 2 April 2015]

### The Parliament of Australia enacts: 

### Part 1--Preliminary

##### 1  Short title

    * This Act may be cited as the _Appropriation (Parliamentary Departments) Act (No. 2) 20142015_.

##### 2  Commencement

    * This Act commences on the day this Act receives the Royal Assent.

##### 3  Definitions

    * In this Act: 

    * **_administered assets and liabilities item_** means an amount set out in Schedule 1 in relation to a Parliamentary Department opposite the heading "Administered Assets and Liabilities".

    * **_administered item_** means an amount set out in Schedule 1 opposite an outcome for a Parliamentary Department under the heading "Administered".

    * **_departmental item_** means the total amount set out in Schedule 1 in relation to a Parliamentary Department under the heading "Departmental".

      * Note: The amounts set out opposite outcomes, under the heading "Departmental", are "notional". They are not part of the item, and do not in any way restrict the scope of the expenditure authorised by the item.

    * **_expenditure_** means payments for expenses, acquiring assets, making loans or paying liabilities.

    * **_item_** means any of the following:

     * (a) a departmental item;

     * (b) an administered item;

     * (c) an administered assets and liabilities item;

     * (d) an other departmental item.

    * **_noncorporate entity_** means:

     * (a) a noncorporate Commonwealth entity within the meaning of the _Public Governance, Performance and Accountability Act 2013_; or

     * (b) the High Court.

      * Note: Each Parliamentary Department is a noncorporate Commonwealth entity for the purposes of the _Public Governance, Performance and Accountability Act 2013_.

    * **_other departmental item_** means an amount set out in Schedule 1 in relation to a Parliamentary Department opposite the heading "Equity Injections".

    * **_Parliamentary Department_** means any of the following:

     * (a) the Department of the Senate;

     * (b) the Department of the House of Representatives;

     * (c) the Department of Parliamentary Services;

     * (d) the Parliamentary Budget Office.

    * **_Portfolio Additional Estimates Statements_** means the Portfolio Additional Estimates Statements that were tabled in the Senate or the House of Representatives in relation to the Bill for this Act.

    * **_Portfolio Budget Statements_** means the Portfolio Budget Statements that were tabled in the Senate or the House of Representatives in relation to the _Appropriation (Parliamentary Departments) Act (No. 1) 20142015_.

    * **_portfolio statements_** means:

     * (a) the Portfolio Budget Statements; and

     * (b) the Portfolio Additional Estimates Statements.

    * **_President_** means the President of the Senate.

    * **_responsible Presiding Officer_** means:

     * (a) in relation to the Department of the Senate--the President; or

     * (b) in relation to the Department of the House of Representatives--the Speaker; or

     * (c) in relation to the Department of Parliamentary Services--the President and the Speaker together; or

     * (d) in relation to the Parliamentary Budget Office--the President and the Speaker together.

    * **_Speaker_** means the Speaker of the House of Representatives.

    * **_special account_** has the same meaning as in the _Public Governance, Performance and Accountability Act 2013_.

##### 4  Portfolio statements

    * The portfolio statements are declared to be relevant documents for the purposes of section 15AB of the _Acts Interpretation Act 1901_.

      * Note: See paragraph 15AB(2)(g) of the _Acts Interpretation Act 1901_ which provides that the material that may be considered in the interpretation of a provision of an Act includes any document that is declared by the Act to be a relevant document.

##### 5  Notional transactions between entities that are part of the Commonwealth

    * For the purposes of this Act, notional transactions between noncorporate entities are to be treated as if they were real transactions.

      * Note: This section applies, for example, to a "payment" between noncorporate entities that are both part of the Commonwealth. One of the effects of this section is that the payment will be debited from an appropriation for the paying noncorporate entity, even though no payment is actually made from the Consolidated Revenue Fund. This is consistent with section 76 of the _Public Governance, Performance and Accountability Act 2013_.

### Part 2--Appropriation items

##### 6  Summary of appropriations

    * The total of the items specified in Schedule 1 is $113,837,000.

      * Note 1: Items in Schedule 1 can be adjusted under Part 3 of this Act.

      * Note 2: Sections 30A and 31 of the _Financial Management and Accountability Act 1997_ also provide for adjustments of amounts appropriated by this Act. Those sections continue to apply because of Part 2 of Schedule 2 to the _Public Governance, Performance and Accountability (Consequential and Transitional Provisions) Act 2014_.

      * Note 3: Sections 74 and 75 of the _Public Governance, Performance and Accountability Act 2013_ also provide for the adjustment of amounts appropriated by this Act.

##### 7  Departmental items

    * The amount specified in a departmental item for a Parliamentary Department may be applied for the departmental expenditure of the Parliamentary Department.

##### 8  Administered items

    * (1) The amount specified in an administered item for an outcome for a Parliamentary Department may be applied for expenditure for the purpose of contributing to achieving that outcome.

    * (2) If the portfolio statements indicate that activities of a particular kind were intended to be treated as activities in respect of a particular outcome, then expenditure for the purpose of carrying out those activities is taken to be expenditure for the purpose of contributing to achieving the outcome.

##### 9  Administered assets and liabilities items

    * (1) The amount specified in an administered assets and liabilities item for a Parliamentary Department may be applied for expenditure for the purpose of contributing to achieving any outcome specified in Schedule 1 for the Parliamentary Department.

    * (2) If the portfolio statements indicate that activities of a particular kind were intended to be treated as activities in respect of a particular outcome, then expenditure for the purpose of carrying out those activities is taken to be expenditure for the purpose of contributing to achieving the outcome.

##### 10  Other departmental items

    * The amount specified in an other departmental item for a Parliamentary Department may be applied for the departmental expenditure of the Parliamentary Department.

### Part 3--Advance to the responsible Presiding Officer

##### 11  Advance to the responsible Presiding Officer

    * (1) If a responsible Presiding Officer determined an amount under subsection 11(2) of the _Appropriation (Parliamentary Departments) Act (No. 1) 20142015_ before the commencement of this Act, the amount is to be disregarded for the purposes of subsections 11(3), (4), (5) and (6) of that Act.

      * Note: This means that, after the commencement of this Act, the responsible Presiding Officers have access to the following amounts under section 11 of the _Appropriation (Parliamentary Departments) Act (No. 1) 20142015_, regardless of amounts that have already been determined under that section:

       * (b) for the Department of the House of Representatives--$300,000;

       * (c) for the Department of Parliamentary Services--$1 million;

       * (d) for the Parliamentary Budget Office--$300,000.

    * (2) If:

     * (a) this Act appropriates an amount for particular expenditure; and

     * (b) before the commencement of this Act, a responsible Presiding Officer determines an amount (the **_advanced amount_**) under section 11 of the _Appropriation (Parliamentary Departments) Act (No. 1) 20142015_ for the expenditure;

    * the amount appropriated by this Act for the expenditure is taken to be reduced (but not below nil) by the advanced amount.

### Part 4--Miscellaneous

##### 12  Crediting amounts to special accounts

    * If any of the purposes of a special account is a purpose that is covered by an item (whether or not the item expressly refers to the special account), then amounts may be debited against the appropriation for that item and credited to that special account.

##### 13  Appropriation of the Consolidated Revenue Fund

     * (a) the _Financial Management and Accountability Act 1997_, as that Act continues to apply because of Schedule 2 to the _Public Governance, Performance and Accountability (Consequential and Transitional Provisions) Act 2014_; and
