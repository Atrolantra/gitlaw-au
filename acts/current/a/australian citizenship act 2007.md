### An Act relating to Australian citizenship

#### Preamble

    * The Parliament recognises that Australian citizenship represents full and formal membership of the community of the Commonwealth of Australia, and Australian citizenship is a common bond, involving reciprocal rights and obligations, uniting all Australians, while respecting their diversity.

    * The Parliament recognises that persons conferred Australian citizenship enjoy these rights and undertake to accept these obligations: 

     * (a) by pledging loyalty to Australia and its people; and

     * (b) by sharing their democratic beliefs; and

     * (c) by respecting their rights and liberties; and

     * (d) by upholding and obeying the laws of Australia.

    * The Parliament of Australia enacts: 

### Part 1--Preliminary

##### 1  Short title

    * This Act may be cited as the _Australian Citizenship Act 2007_.

##### 2  Commencement

    * (1) Each provision of this Act specified in column 1 of the table commences, or is taken to have commenced, in accordance with column 2 of the table. Any other statement in column 2 has effect according to its terms.

What this Act covers

    * This Act sets out how you become an Australian citizen, the circumstances in which you may cease to be a citizen and some other matters related to citizenship.

Becoming an Australian citizen

    * There are a range of ways you can become an Australian citizen.

Acquiring citizenship automatically

    * Generally, you become an Australian citizen automatically if you are born in Australia and one or both of your parents are Australian citizens or permanent residents when you are born.

    * There are some other, less common, ways of automatically becoming a citizen.

    * Division 1 of Part 2 has details about acquiring citizenship automatically.

    * Also, if you were a citizen under the old Act immediately before the day that this section commences, you will continue to be a citizen: see subsection 4(1).

Acquiring citizenship by application

    * The other way to become an Australian citizen is to apply to the Minister. This is covered by Division 2 of Part 2. There are 4 situations in which you can apply for citizenship.

    * The first is citizenship by descent. Generally, you would apply for this if you were born outside Australia and one or both of your parents were Australian citizens when you were born. Citizenship by descent is covered by Subdivision A.

    *  The second is citizenship for persons adopted in accordance with the Hague Convention on Intercountry Adoption or a bilateral arrangement: see Subdivision AA.

    * The third is citizenship by conferral. Generally, you would need to be a permanent resident and willing to make a pledge of commitment to apply for citizenship by conferral. You may need to successfully complete a citizenship test. There are some less common circumstances in which you can apply for citizenship by conferral. Citizenship by conferral is covered by Subdivision B.

    * The fourth is resuming citizenship. In certain cases where you previously ceased to be an Australian citizen, you can apply for your citizenship to resume. Resuming citizenship is covered by Subdivision C.

    * The Minister must be satisfied of your identity for you to acquire citizenship by application. Rules about identification are in Division 5 of Part 2.

    * The Minister may be required to refuse your application on national security grounds.

Ceasing to be an Australian citizen

    * There are a number of ways that you can cease to be an Australian citizen.

    * You can renounce your citizenship.

    * If you did not automatically become an Australian citizen, the Minister can revoke your citizenship in certain circumstances.

    * There are some other, less common, ways of ceasing to be a citizen.

    * Division 3 of Part 2 has details about ceasing to be a citizen.
