### An Act about a tax, relating to certain alcoholic beverages, to implement A New Tax System, and for related purposes

### Part 1--Introduction

#### Division 1--Preliminary

##### 11  Short title

    * This Act may be cited as the _A New Tax System (Wine Equalisation Tax) Act 1999_.

##### 12  Commencement

    * This Act commences on 1 July 2000.

##### 13  How the wine tax law applies to things outside the indirect tax zone and things happening before commencement

    * (1) The *wine tax law extends to acts, omissions, matters and things outside Australia (within the meaning of the *ITAA 1997) (except where a contrary intention appears).

    * (2) The *wine tax law applies to acts and omissions happening before or after the commencement of this Act (except where there is an express statement to the contrary).

##### 14  States and Territories are bound by the wine tax law

    * The *wine tax law binds the Crown in right of each of the States, of the Australian Capital Territory and of the Northern Territory. However, it does not make the Crown liable to be prosecuted for an offence.

#### Division 2--Overview of the wine tax legislation

##### 21  What this Act is about

    * This Act is about the wine equalisation tax (or wine tax).

    * The wine tax is a single stage tax applying (in most cases) to dealings in wine at the wholesale level. In almost all dealings to which it applies, the GST will also apply.

        * Note 1: **_Wine_** is widely defined in Subdivision 31A. It can apply to beverages fermented from any fruit or vegetable. It also extends to cider, perry, mead and sake.

        * Note 2: The wine tax is imposed by 3 Acts:

         * (a) the _A New Tax System (Wine Equalisation Tax Imposition--General) Act 1999_; and

         * (b) the _A New Tax System (Wine Equalisation Tax Imposition--Customs) Act 1999_; and

         * (c) the _A New Tax System (Wine Equalisation Tax Imposition--Excise) Act 1999_.

##### 25  Liability to tax (Part 2)

    * Part 2 sets out the rules that establish the liability for the wine tax. The broad aim of the wine tax law is to tax the last wholesale sale of wine (usually the sale from the last wholesaler to the retailer).

##### 210  Quoting (Part 3)

    * Part 3 is about quoting. The system of quoting is designed to avoid wine tax becoming payable on earlier sales.

##### 215  Wine tax credits (Part 4)

    * Part 4 is about the entitlement to, and claiming of, wine tax credits. The system of wine tax credits deals (among other things) with situations where wine tax has become payable more than once on the same wine.

##### 220  Payment of wine tax (Part 5)

    * Part 5 provides for amounts of wine tax, and wine tax credits, to be included in net amounts under the GST system. This has the effect of incorporating the wine tax into the payments and refunds system for the GST. However, the assessed wine tax is paid together with customs duty (where appropriate).

##### 225  Miscellaneous (Part 6)

    * Part 6 deals with miscellaneous matters.

##### 230  Interpretative provisions (Part 7)

    * Part 7 contains the Dictionary, which sets out a list of all the terms that are defined in this Act. It also sets out the meanings of some important concepts and rules on how to interpret this Act.

##### 233  Administration, collection and recovery provisions in the Taxation Administration Act 1953

    * Parts 310, 41 and 415 in Schedule 1 to the _Taxation Administration Act 1953_ contain provisions relating to the administration of the wine tax, and to collection and recovery of amounts of wine tax.

#### Division 3--Defined terms

##### 31  When defined terms are identified

    * (1) Many of the terms used in the law relating to the wine tax are defined.

    * (2) Most defined terms in this Act are identified by an asterisk appearing at the start of the term: as in "*taxable dealing". The footnote that goes with the asterisk contains a signpost to the Dictionary definitions starting at section 331.

##### 35  When terms are not identified

    * (1) Once a defined term has been identified by an asterisk, later occurrences of the term in the same subsection are _not_ usually asterisked.

    * (2) Terms are _not_ asterisked in the nonoperative material contained in this Act.

        * Note: The nonoperative material is described in Division 4.

    * (3) The following basic terms used throughout the Act are _not_ identified with an asterisk.

##### 310  Identifying the defined term in a definition

    * Within a definition, the defined term is identified by **_bold italics_**.

#### Division 4--Status of Guides and other nonoperative material

##### 41  Nonoperative material

    * In addition to the operative provisions themselves, this Act contains other material to help you identify accurately and quickly the provisions that are relevant to you and to help you understand them.

    * This other material falls into 2 main categories.

##### 45  Explanatory sections

    * One category is the explanatory section in many Divisions. Under the section heading "What this Division is about", a short explanation of the Division appears in boxed text.

    * Explanatory sections form part of this Act but are not operative provisions. In interpreting an operative provision, explanatory sections may only be considered for limited purposes. They are set out in section 2910.

##### 410  Other material

    * The other category consists of material such as notes and examples. These also form part of the Act. They are distinguished by type size from the operative provisions (except for formulas), but are not kept separate from them.

### Part 2--Wine tax

#### Division 5--General rules for taxability

##### 51  What this Division is about

    * Liability for wine tax centres around the concept of an assessable dealing. This concept is defined in the Assessable Dealings Table and the sections following the table.

##### 55  General rules for taxing assessable dealings

    * (1) The *Assessable Dealings Table sets out all the *assessable dealings that can be subject to wine tax.

    * (2) If the time of an *assessable dealing (as specified in column 4 of the table) is on or after 1 July 2000, and no exemption applies under Division 7, then:

     * (a) the dealing is a *taxable dealing; and

     * (b) the entity specified in column 3 is the entity liable to the tax; and

     * (c) the tax becomes payable at the time of the dealing, as specified in column 4.

    * However, an assessable dealing (other than a *customs dealing) is a taxable dealing only if the entity specified in column 3 is *registered or *required to be registered.

        * Note: Under Part 5, amounts of wine tax, on assessable dealings (other than customs dealings), are included in your net amount under the GST system.

    * (3) To calculate the amount of the tax:

     * (a) determine the *taxable value of the dealing under Division 9; and

     * (b) multiply the result by 29%.

        * Note: The amount of tax is reduced for some importations (e.g. accompanied baggage of passengers) that are free of customs duty (see section 540).

    * (4) The table does not apply to a dealing with wine unless the wine is *assessable wine immediately before the time of the dealing, and is in the indirect tax zone at the time of the dealing.

        * Note: The numbering of items in the table uses the following pattern:

        * For Australian wine, the dealings are divided into 4 groups:

          * wholesale sales begin with AD1

          * retail sales begin with AD2

          * an AOU begins with AD3

          * miscellaneous dealings begin with AD4.

        * Imported wine has an additional class of local entry (AD10). The other dealings with imported wine have a number that is 10 higher than the broadly corresponding dealing with Australian wine. For example, AD12b for imported wine corresponds to AD2b for Australian wine.

##### 510  Sale time brought forward if purchaser uses the wine before title passes

    * (1) This section applies to an *assessable dealing that consists of a sale, if the purchaser uses the wine after the time when the contract is made but before the time when title is to pass to the purchaser under the contract.

    * (2) The time when the purchaser first so uses the wine is taken to be the time of the sale for the purposes of the *wine tax law.

##### 515  Royaltyinclusive sale (AD2c and AD12c) or AOU (AD3d and AD13d)

    * (1) A *retail sale, or an *AOU, of wine (the **_current wine_**) by you in the course of a business is a**_ royaltyinclusive sale_** or a **_royaltyinclusive AOU_** respectively if the following conditions are met:

     * (a) *eligible royalty costs have been incurred at or before the time of the sale or AOU, or could reasonably be expected to be incurred after the time of the sale or AOU, by any or all of the following:

      * (i) you;

      * (ii) your *associate;

      * (iii) any entity (other than the *manufacturer) under an arrangement with you or with your associate;

     * (b) the sale or AOU is not covered by another category of *assessable dealing in the *Assessable Dealings Table.

    * (2) **_Eligible royalty cost_** is a *royalty that is paid or payable in connection with the current wine, except where the amount was paid or payable by any entity before 24 March 1999.

##### 520  Indirect marketing sale (AD2d and AD12d)

    * A sale of *assessable wine is an**_ indirect marketing sale_** if it is a *retail sale made by an entity (the**_ marketer_**) that is not the *manufacturer of the wine and the sale is made:

     * (a) under an arrangement that provides for the sale of the wine to be made by an entity that is acting for the marketer but is not an employee of the marketer; or

     * (b) from premises that:

      * (i) are used, mainly for making retail sales of wine, by an entity or entities other than the marketer; and

      * (ii) are held out to be premises of, or premises used by, the other entity or entities.

##### 525  Untaxed sale (AD2e and AD12e) or AOU (AD3a and AD13a)

    * (1) A *retail sale of wine by you is an **_untaxed sale_** unless:

     * (a) you *obtained the wine under quote; or

     * (b) the wine has previously passed through a taxing point; or

     * (c) the sale is an *indirect marketing sale.

    * (2) An *AOU, in the course of any business, by you is an **_untaxed AOU _**unless:

     * (a) you *obtained the wine under quote; or

     * (b) the wine has previously passed through a taxing point.

    * (3) For the purposes of this section, wine is taken to have passed through a taxing point only if:

     * (a) the wine has been the subject of a *taxable dealing; or

     * (b) the wine has been the subject of an *assessable dealing that was exempted because you could not be taxed or were entitled to an exemption arising outside the *wine tax law; or

     * (c) the wine has been the subject of sales tax within the meaning of the former _Sales Tax Assessment Act 1992_; or

     * (d) section 5 of the former _Sales Tax Amendment (Transitional) Act 1992_ applies to the wine (whether or not the wine would, but for that section, have been subject to sales tax under the former _Sales Tax Assessment Act 1992_).

         * Note: Section 5 ensured that goods subject to sales tax under the pre1992 sales tax law were not also taxable under the 1992 sales tax law.

##### 530  Local entry of imported wine (AD10) 

    * (1) The Local Entry Table sets out the situations that amount to a local entry of *imported wine for the purposes of the *wine tax law. The rest of this section deals with situations involving the withdrawal of a customs entry, or multiple local entries of the same wine.

    * (2) The withdrawal of the customs entry underlying a formal local entry (the **_earlier local entry_**) usually has the effect that the earlier local entry is taken never to have happened. However, if:

     * (a) there is a later formal local entry after the withdrawal; and

     * (b) the tax on that later entry would be less than the tax on the earlier local entry;

    * then the earlier local entry is taken never to have been extinguished and the later entry is taken never to have happened.

    * (3) If a formal local entry happens after a deemed local entry, the formal local entry is taken never to have happened.

    * (4) If a deemed local entry happens after a formal local entry, the formal local entry is taken never to have happened.

    * (5) In this section:

    * **_customs entry_** means an entry for home consumption under the _Customs Act 1901_.

    * **_deemed local entry_** means a local entry that is not a formal local entry.

    * **_formal local entry_** means a local entry covered by *LE1 or *LE2 in the Local Entry Table.

#### Division 7--Exemptions

##### 71  What this Division is about

    * In some circumstances, a dealing with wine is exempt from wine tax even if it is an assessable dealing.

##### 75  Exemption for dealings that are GSTfree supplies or nontaxable importations

    * An *assessable dealing is not taxable if the dealing is:

     * (a) a *supply that is *GSTfree (other than because of Subdivision 38D (child care) of the *GST Act); or

     * (b) a *local entry relating to an *importation that is a *nontaxable importation.

##### 710  Exemptions based on quoting

    * (1) A sale is not taxable if the purchaser *quotes for the sale at or before the time of the sale.

    * (2) A *customs dealing is not taxable if the entity that would, apart from this subsection, be liable for the wine tax on the dealing *quotes for the dealing at or before the time of the dealing.

##### 715  Exemptions based on Schedule 4 to the Customs Tariff Act 1995

    * (1) A *customs dealing is not taxable if it is an *importation of wine covered by item 10, 11, 15, 18, 21, 21A, 24 or 27 in Schedule 4 to the *Customs Tariff.

    * (2) To avoid doubt, a reference to wine that is covered by an item in Schedule 4 to the *Customs Tariff includes a reference to goods to which that item would apply apart from the operation of subsection 18(1) of the _Customs Tariff Act 1995_.

##### 720  Exemption for local entry if wine has been taxed while in bond

    * A *local entry of wine is not taxable if you or anyone else became liable to tax on a previous *assessable dealing with the wine while it was in bond or under the control of *Customs.

##### 725  Goods returned to the indirect tax zone in an unaltered condition

    * (1) A *local entry of wine is not taxable if:

     * (a) the wine was exported from the indirect tax zone and is returned to the indirect tax zone, without having been subject to any treatment, industrial processing, alteration or any other process since its export; and

     * (b) the importer was not entitled to, and did not claim, a payment under Division 25 (about the tourist refund scheme) related to the export of the wine; and

     * (c) the importer:

      * (i) is the manufacturer of the wine; or

      * (ii) has previously acquired the wine, and the supply by means of which the importer acquired the wine was a *taxable dealing; or

      * (iii) has previously imported the goods, and the previous importation was a *taxable dealing.

    * (2) A *local entry of wine is not taxable if:

     * (a) the importer had manufactured, acquired or imported the wine before 1 July 2000; and

     * (b) the wine was exported from the indirect tax zone before, on or after 1 July 2000; and

     * (c) the wine is returned to the indirect tax zone on or after 1 July 2000, without having been subject to any treatment, industrial processing, alteration or any other process since its export; and

     * (d) the importer was not entitled to, and did not claim, a payment under Division 25 (about the tourist refund scheme) related to the export of the wine; and

     * (e) the ownership of the wine when it is returned to the indirect tax zone is the same as its ownership on 1 July 2000.

        * Note: An importation covered by this section may also be dutyfree under item 17 of Schedule 4 to the _Customs Tariff Act 1995_.

#### Division 9--Taxable value

##### 91  What this Division is about

    * In most cases, the taxable value of an assessable dealing is multiplied by the rate of wine tax to calculate the amount of wine tax.

##### Subdivision 9A--General rules for working out taxable value

##### 95  How to work out the taxable value of a taxable dealing

    * (1) The general rules for calculating the **_taxable value _**are set out in the *Assessable Dealings Table.

    * (2) In some cases, the *Assessable Dealings Table refers to the *notional wholesale selling price as the *taxable value. Subdivision 9B sets out how to work out the notional wholesale selling price.

    * (3) In some cases, amounts must be added to the amount set out in the *Assessable Dealings Table. These additions are set out in Subdivision 9C.

    * (4) In working out the *taxable value of wine, any rebate, refund or other payment or credit made by a State or Territory in respect of the wine is to be disregarded.

##### 910  Agreement with Commissioner regarding calculation of taxable value

    * (1) The Commissioner may enter into an agreement with you about calculating the *taxable values of particular *taxable dealings for which you are liable for the wine tax.

    * (2) So far as the agreement is inconsistent with this Act, the agreement prevails.

##### Subdivision 9B--Notional wholesale selling price

##### 925  The 2 methods of working out notional wholesale selling prices for retail dealings with grape wine

    * (1) There are 2 methods for working out the **_notional wholesale selling price_** for a *taxable dealing that is either:

     * (a) a *retail sale of *grape wine; or

     * (b) an *AOU connected with retail sales of wine that is grape wine.

    * (2) The *half retail price method is used unless you have chosen under subsection (3) to use the *average wholesale price method.

    * (3) You may choose to use the *average wholesale price method if, during the *tax period in respect of which you are liable to pay wine tax on the dealing, at least 10% by value of all your sales of *grape wine that:

     * (a) is of the same vintage as the grape wine to which the dealing relates; and

     * (b) is produced from the same grape varieties, or the same blend of grape varieties, as the grape wine to which the dealing relates;

    * are *wholesale sales.

##### 930  Working out notional wholesale selling prices for retail dealings with wine that is not grape wine

    * The **_notional wholesale selling price_** for a *taxable dealing that is either:

     * (a) a *retail sale of wine that is not *grape wine; or

     * (b) an *AOU connected with retail sales of wine that is not grape wine;

    * is worked out using the *half retail price method.

##### 935  The half retail price method

    * (1) The notional wholesale selling price for a *retail sale of *grape wine, worked out using the **_half retail price method_**, is 50% of the *price of the sale.

    * (2) The notional wholesale selling price for an *AOU connected with retail sales of grape wine, worked out using the **_half retail price method_**, is 50% of the *price for which you would normally have sold the wine if the sale were a *retail sale.

##### 940  The average wholesale price method

    * The notional wholesale selling price for a *retail sale of *grape wine, or for an *AOU connected with retail sales of grape wine, worked out using the **_average wholesale price method_** is the weighted average of the *prices (excluding wine tax and *GST) for *wholesale sales that you have made of grape wine that:

     * (a) is of the same vintage as the grape wine to which the retail sale or AOU relates; and

     * (b) is produced from the same grape varieties, or the same blend of grape varieties, as the grape wine to which the retail sale or AOU relates;

    * during the *tax period in respect of which you are liable to pay wine tax on the retail sale or AOU.

        * Example: If, during a tax period, you make 70% of wholesale sales of grape wine of a particular vintage and variety at $80 per dozen, and the remaining 30% at $90 per dozen, the weighted average of the wholesale prices for wholesale sales during the tax period is:

##### 945  Notional wholesale selling prices for other dealings

    * The **_notional wholesale selling price_** for a taxable dealing with wine that is neither:

     * (a) a *retail sale of wine; nor

     * (b) an *AOU connected with retail sales of wine;

    * is the *price (excluding wine tax and *GST) for which you could reasonably have been expected to sell the wine by wholesale under an arm's length transaction.

##### Subdivision 9C--Additions to taxable value

##### 965  Taxable dealing with wine that is the contents of a container

    * (1) This section deals with situations in which a *container is associated with wine (the**_ contents_**) that is the subject of a *taxable dealing. The aim of this section is to ensure that the *taxable value will include a component for the container, even though the parties may have allocated a separate amount to the container.

    * (2) If:

     * (a) the *taxable value of the dealing is calculated by reference to the *price (excluding wine tax and *GST) for which the contents were sold; and

     * (b) the parties have allocated a separate amount to the *container;

    * then the taxable value is *increased by so much of the value of the container as is recouped by the seller in connection with the sale of the contents.

    * (3) If the *taxable value of the dealing is not calculated as mentioned in subsection (2), then the taxable value is *increased by so much of the value of the *container as could reasonably be expected to have been recouped by you in connection with a hypothetical sale of the contents at the time of the actual *taxable dealing with the contents.

##### 970  Assessable dealings with wine that involve the payment of an associated royalty

    * (1) If a *royalty is paid or payable, or likely to be paid or payable, in connection with any of the following events in respect of particular wine:

     * (a) the *manufacture of the wine;

     * (b) the *importation or *local entry of the wine;

     * (c) a sale of the wine;

    * then the *taxable value of any *taxable dealing with that wine that happens at or after that event includes the amount or value of the royalty.

    * (2) **_Royalty_** is any amount to the extent to which it is paid or payable (whether or not periodically) as consideration for any of the following things (or for the right to do them):

     * (a) doing anything that would be an infringement of copyright if it were done without the licence of the copyright owner;

     * (b) making, using, exercising or vending an invention (each of those terms having the meaning it has in the_ Patents Act 1990_);

     * (c) using a design that is of a kind capable of being registered under the _Designs Act 2003 _(whether or not it is registered under that Act or under any other law);

     * (d) using a trade mark that is of a kind capable of being registered under the _Trade Marks Act 1995 _(whether or not it is registered under that Act or under any other law), but not including a mark that relates to a service;

     * (e) using confidential information;

     * (f) using machinery, implements, apparatus or other equipment;

     * (g) *supplying scientific, technical, industrial, commercial or other knowledge or information;

     * (h) supplying assistance that is ancillary to, and is supplied as a means of enabling the application or enjoyment of, any matter covered by paragraphs (a) to (g);

     * (i) a total or partial forbearance in respect of any matter covered by paragraphs (a) to (h).

    * Terms used in paragraph (a) of this definition have the same meaning as in the _Copyright Act 1968_.

##### 975  Assessable dealing with wine in bond

    * If a *taxable dealing happens while the wine is in bond or otherwise subject to the control of *Customs, the *taxable value is *increased by the amount of *customs duty to which the wine would have been subject if it had been entered for home consumption under the _Customs Act 1901_ at the time of the taxable dealing.

##### 980  Amounts not to be added if they are already included in the taxable value

    * This Subdivision does not add any amount to the *taxable value so far as it would already be included in the taxable value.

### Part 3--Quoting

#### Division 13--Quoting for dealings in wine

##### 131  What this Division is about

    * In certain circumstances you can quote for a dealing with wine. This is designed to avoid the wine tax becoming payable on sales preceding the last wholesale sale. (Under section 710, wine tax is not payable on a sale for which the purchaser has quoted.)

##### 135  Standard grounds for quoting ABN

    * (1) You are entitled to *quote your *ABN for a dealing with wine if, at the time of quoting, you have the intention of dealing with the wine in any of the following ways:

     * (a) selling the wine by *wholesale, or by *indirect marketing sale, while the wine is in the indirect tax zone;

     * (b) selling the wine, by any kind of sale, while it is in the indirect tax zone (this ground is available only if you are mainly a wholesaler at the time of quoting);

     * (c) using the wine as a material in *manufacture or other treatment or processing, whether or not it relates to or results in other wine;

     * (d) making a *supply of the wine that will be *GSTfree.

    * (2) However, you are not entitled to *quote unless you are *registered.

    * (3) For the purposes of paragraph (1)(b), you are mainly a wholesaler at the quoting time only if:

     * (a) *wholesale sales and *indirect marketing sales account for more than half of the total value of all sales of *assessable wine by you during the 12 months ending at the quoting time; or

     * (b) you have an expectation (based on reasonable grounds) that wholesale sales and indirect marketing sales will account for more than half of the total value of all sales of assessable wine by you during the 12 months starting at the quoting time.

    * For this purpose, the value of a sale of wine is the *price for which the wine is sold.

##### 1310  Additional quoting grounds in special circumstances

    * The Commissioner may (if you are *registered) authorise you to *quote your *ABN in special circumstances in which you would not otherwise be entitled to quote.

##### 1315  Periodic quoting

    * (1) You may make a periodic *quote under this section for purchases that you propose to make from an entity (the**_ supplier_**) during the period, not exceeding 12 months, covered by the periodic quote.

    * (2) If you make such a periodic *quote on or before the first day of the period to which the quote relates, you are treated as having quoted your *ABN for all purchases during the period from the *supplier, other than purchases in respect of which you have notified the supplier in accordance with subsection (3).

    * (3) If you are not entitled to *quote for a particular purchase from the *supplier during the period, you must notify the supplier of that fact at or before the time of the purchase. The notification must be in the *approved form.

    * (4) You commit an offence if you contravene subsection (3).

      * Penalty: 20 penalty units.

        * Note 1: Chapter 2 of the _Criminal Code_ sets out the general principles of criminal responsibility.

        * Note 2: See section 4AA of the _Crimes Act 1914 _for the current value of a penalty unit.

    * (5) Section 1330 applies to a *quote that you are treated as having made under subsection (2) of this section for a particular purchase.

##### 1320  Manner in which quote must be made

    * (1) A *quote (including a periodic quote) must be made in the *approved form.

    * (2) A *quote for a dealing is not effective unless it is made at or before the time of the dealing.

##### 1325  Incorrect quote nevertheless effective for certain purposes

    * If you *quote in circumstances in which you are not entitled to quote, or the quote is not in the *approved form, the quote is nevertheless:

     * (a) effective for the purposes of Subdivision 31D; and

     * (b) effective for the purpose of section 710, unless section 1330 applies.

##### 1330  Quote not effective for certain purposes if there are grounds for believing it was improperly made

    * A *quote is not effective, so far as it would have resulted in an exemption or a ground for a *CR6 wine tax credit, if at the time of the quote the entity to which the quote is made has reasonable grounds for believing that:

     * (a) you are not entitled to quote in the particular circumstances; or

     * (b) the quote is not made in the *approved form; or

     * (c) the quote is false or misleading in a material particular (either because of something stated in the quote or something left out).

##### 1335  Improper quoting is an offence

    * You must not, in relation to any dealing with wine:

     * (a) quote an *ABN for the purposes of this Act:

      * (i) in circumstances in which you are not entitled to quote; or

      * (ii) in contravention of subsection 1320(1); or

     * (b) in any other way falsely quote an ABN.

      * Penalty: 20 penalty units.

        * Note 1: Chapter 2 of the _Criminal Code_ sets out the general principles of criminal responsibility.

        * Note 2: See section 4AA of the _Crimes Act 1914 _for the current value of a penalty unit.

        * Note 3: Section 23 of the _A New Tax System (Australian Business Number) Act 1999_ provides penalties for misuse of ABNs.

### Part 4--Wine tax credits

#### Division 17--Wine tax credits

##### 171  What this Division is about

    * Wine tax credits can arise in a number of circumstances. Generally speaking, they prevent wine tax applying more than once to the same goods.

        * Note: If you are in the GST system, wine tax credits are included in your net amounts (see Part 5). If you are not in the GST system, you can claim wine tax credits under this Part. Producer rebates under Division 19 are a form of wine tax credit.

##### 175  Wine tax credit entitlements

    * (1) The *Wine Tax Credit Table sets out the situations in which you are entitled to a *wine tax credit.

    * (2) You are not entitled to a *wine tax credit for an amount of tax for which a wine tax credit entitlement has previously arisen (whether for you or another entity).

    * (3) You are not entitled to a *wine tax credit unless you make a claim for the wine tax credit under section 1710.

##### 1710  Claims for wine tax credits

    * (1) If you are *registered or *required to be registered, you may make a claim for a *wine tax credit (other than a claim for a *producer rebate under subsection 195(2)) by including the amount of the wine tax credit in the *reduction of your *net amount for the*tax period in question under section 2115.

    * (2) If you are not *registered or *required to be registered, you may make a claim for a *wine tax credit (other than a claim for a *producer rebate under subsection 195(2)) in the *approved form. The claim must be accompanied by such supporting evidence as the Commissioner requires.

    * (2A) If you are a *New Zealand participant, you may make a claim for a *wine tax credit under subsection 195(2) in the *approved form. The claim must be accompanied by such supporting evidence as the Commissioner requires.

    * (2B) The Commissioner may determine, by legislative instrument, the time or times during which claims for *wine tax credits under subsection 195(2) may be made.

    * (3) A claim under subsection (2) or (2A) must be lodged with the Commissioner within 4 years after the time when the *wine tax credit arises.

##### 1715  Commissioner not required to consider credit claims for less than $200

    * The Commissioner is not required to consider a claim under subsection 1710(2) or (2A) for a *wine tax credit if the total amount claimed is less than $200.

##### 1720  Wine tax credits to be applied against tax liabilities and excess refunded

     * If you have claimed under subsection 1710(2) or (2A) a *wine tax credit to which you are entitled, the Commissioner must apply the wine tax credit under Division 3 of Part IIB of the _Taxation Administration Act 1953_.

##### 1725  Excess wine tax credits must be repaid

    * If the amount applied by the Commissioner in accordance with section 1720 is more than the amount of the *wine tax credit to which you are properly entitled, the excess is to be treated as if it were wine tax that became payable, and due for payment, by you at the time when it was applied.

        * Note: The main effect of treating the amount as if it were tax is to apply the collection and recovery rules in Part 310 in Schedule 1 to the _Taxation Administration Act 1953_.

##### 1730  Clawback of CR15 wine tax credit on later recovery of bad debt

    * (1) A *wine tax credit under *CR15 in relation to an amount written off by you as a bad debt is subject to the condition that you are liable to pay an amount under this section if you later recover some or all of the amount written off.

    * (2) The amount payable by you is calculated using the following formula:

    * (3) The amount is to be treated as if it were wine tax that became payable by you at the time of recovery of the bad debt, and, for the purposes of Part 5, were attributable to the *tax period in which the recovery happened.

        * Note: The main effect of treating the amount as if it were wine tax is to apply the collection and recovery rules in Part 310 in Schedule 1 to the _Taxation Administration Act 1953_.

##### 1735  Clawback of CR8 wine tax credit on later sale of defective wine

    * (1) A *wine tax credit under *CR8 for wine tax on wine that was used to replace defective wine is subject to the condition that you are liable to pay an amount under this section if you later sell the defective wine.

    * (2) The amount payable by you is calculated using the following formula:

    * (3) The amount is to be treated as if it were wine tax that became payable by you at the time of the later sale of the defective wine, and, for the purposes of Part 5, were attributable to the *tax period in which the later sale happened.

        * Note: The main effect of treating the amount as if it were wine tax is to apply the collection and recovery rules in Part 310 in Schedule 1 to the _Taxation Administration Act 1953_.

##### 1737  Clawback of CR10 wine tax credit on later sale

    * (1) A *wine tax credit under *CR10 in relation to wine that is *exported is subject to the condition that you are liable to pay an amount equal to the credit if:

     * (a) the wine is returned to the indirect tax zone; and

     * (b) the *local entry of the wine is not taxable because of:

      * (i) paragraph 75(b) (as it operates because of section 4210 of the *GST Act); or

      * (ii) section 725; and

     * (c) you later sell the wine by *retail sale or there is a later *AOU of the wine.

    * (2) The amount is to be treated as if it were wine tax that became payable by you at the time of the later sale or later *AOU of the wine, and, for the purposes of Part 5, were attributable to the *tax period in which the later sale or later AOU happened.

        * Note: The main effect of treating the amount as if it were wine tax is to apply the collection and recovery rules in Part 310 in Schedule 1 to the _Taxation Administration Act 1953_.

##### 1740  Agreement with Commissioner regarding wine tax credits

    * (1) The Commissioner may enter into an agreement with you regarding the manner of calculating and claiming *wine tax credits to which you are entitled.

    * (2) So far as the agreement is inconsistent with this Act, the agreement prevails.

##### 1745  Notifying disallowance of wine tax credit claim

    * If the Commissioner decides to disallow the whole or a part of a claim for a *wine tax credit, the Commissioner must notify you of the decision.

        * Note: Disallowing the whole or a part of a claim for a wine tax credit is a reviewable wine tax decision (see Subdivision 111C in Schedule 1 to the_ Taxation Administration Act 1953_).

#### Division 19--Producer rebates

##### 191  What this Division is about

    * Wine producers are entitled to a rebate for certain dealings in wine. The rebate is provided in the form of a wine tax credit.

        * Note: Credit ground CR9 is producer rebates.

##### 195  Entitlement to producer rebates

    * (1) You are entitled to a *producer rebate for *rebatable wine for a *financial year if you are the *producer of the wine and:

     * (a) you are liable to wine tax for a *taxable dealing in the wine during the financial year; or

     * (b) you would have been liable to wine tax for a dealing in the wine during the financial year had the purchaser not *quoted for the sale at or before the time of the sale.

    * (2) You are entitled to a *producer rebate for *rebatable wine for a *financial year if:

     * (a) you are approved as a *New Zealand participant; and

     * (b) the wine was *produced by you in *New Zealand and exported to the indirect tax zone; and

     * (c) you, or another entity, paid wine tax for a *taxable dealing in the wine during the financial year.

##### 197  Approval as New Zealand participant

    * (1) You may apply, in writing, in the *approved form, to the Commissioner for approval as a *New Zealand participant.

    * (2) You are eligible to be approved as a *New Zealand participant if the Commissioner is satisfied, on the basis of your application and any other relevant information of which the Commissioner becomes aware, that:

     * (a) you are a *producer of *rebatable wine in *New Zealand; and

     * (b) the rebatable wine has been, or is likely to be, exported to the indirect tax zone.

    * (3) If the Commissioner, after consideration of your application, is satisfied of the matters referred to in subsection (2) in relation to you, the Commissioner must, by written instrument, approve you as a *New Zealand participant.

    * (4) The Commissioner must decide the date of effect of that approval and include that date in the instrument of approval. That date may be the day of the decision, or a day before or after that day.

        * Note: Deciding under this subsection the date of effect of any approval of an entity as a New Zealand participant is a reviewable wine tax decision (see Subdivision 111C in Schedule 1 to the _Taxation Administration Act 1953_).

    * (5) If the Commissioner approves you as a *New Zealand participant, the Commissioner must, by notice in writing sent to you, inform you that you have been so approved and of the date from which the approval has effect.

    * (6) If the Commissioner, after consideration of your application, is not satisfied of the matters referred to in subsection (2) in relation to you, the Commissioner must:

     * (a) by written instrument, refuse to approve you as a *New Zealand participant; and

     * (b) by notice in writing sent to you, inform you that the Commissioner has so decided and of the reasons for that decision.

        * Note: Refusing to approve an entity as a New Zealand participant is a reviewable wine tax decision (see Subdivision 111C in Schedule 1 to the _Taxation Administration Act 1953_).

    * (7) An instrument of approval under subsection (3) and an instrument refusing approval under subsection (6) are not legislative instruments.

##### 198  Revoking an approval as a New Zealand participant

    * (1) If, at any time, the Commissioner becomes aware that you cease to satisfy the criteria for approval as a *New Zealand participant, the Commissioner must, by written instrument, revoke your approval.

        * Note: Revoking under this subsection the approval of an entity as a New Zealand participant is a reviewable wine tax decision (see Subdivision 111C in Schedule 1 to the _Taxation Administration Act 1953_).

    * (2) The Commissioner must decide the date of effect of that revocation and include that date in the instrument of revocation. That date may be the day of the decision, or a day before or after that day.

        * Note: Deciding under this subsection the date of effect of any revocation of an approval as a New Zealand participant is a reviewable wine tax decision (see Subdivision 111C in Schedule 1 to the _Taxation Administration Act 1953_).

    * (3) If the Commissioner revokes your approval as a *New Zealand participant, the Commissioner must, by notice in writing sent to you, inform you that the Commissioner has revoked your approval, indicate the date from which the revocation has effect and of the reasons for revoking that approval.

    * (4) An instrument of revocation under subsection (1) is not a legislative instrument.

##### 199  Notification of changed circumstances

    * (1) An entity approved as a *New Zealand participant must notify the Commissioner in writing of any circumstances under which the Commissioner must revoke the approval. The notification must be given to the Commissioner within 21 days after the circumstances occurred.

##### 1910  Exceptions

    * (1) You are not entitled to a *producer rebate because of paragraph 195(1)(b) for a dealing in wine if the purchaser notifies you at or before the time of purchase that the purchaser intends to make a *supply of the wine that will be *GSTfree.

    * (2) You are not entitled to a *producer rebate because of subsection 195(1) for a dealing in wine for which you are liable to wine tax if you have claimed a *wine tax credit, or a wine tax credit subsequently arises for you, for the dealing (except because of a producer rebate).

    * (3) You are not entitled to a *producer rebate because of subsection 195(2) for a dealing in wine *produced in *New Zealand if:

     * (a) the wine is exported from the indirect tax zone after that dealing; and

     * (b) at the time of a claim for producer rebate in respect of that wine you were, or should reasonably have been, aware that the wine had been, or would be, so exported.

    * (4) You are not entitled to a *producer rebate because of subsection 195(2) for a dealing in wine *produced in *New Zealand if a producer rebate has previously been paid in respect of the wine.

##### 1915  Amount of producer rebates

    * (1) The amount of the *producer rebates to which you are entitled because of subsection 195(1) for the wine for the *financial year is:

     * (a) for *wholesale sales--29% of the *price (excluding wine tax and *GST) for which the wine was sold; and

     * (b) for *retail sales and *AOUs--29% of the *notional wholesale selling price of the wine.

    * (1A) The amount of the *producer rebates to which you are entitled because of subsection 195(2) for the wine for the *financial year is an amount equal to 29% of the approved selling price for the wine.

    * (1B) In working out the amount of the *producer rebate to which you are entitled because of subsection 195(2), any component used to determine the approved selling price that is expressed in a currency other than Australian currency is to be treated as if it were an amount of Australian currency worked out in the manner determined, by legislative instrument, by the Commissioner.

    * (1C) In this section:

    * **_approved selling price_**, in relation to wine sold by a *New Zealand participant, means the participant's selling price for the wine net of any expenses unrelated to the production of the wine in *New Zealand, including but not limited to:

     * (a) expenses relating to transportation, freight and insurance, agent's fees and any other costs associated with exportation of the wine from New Zealand and importation of the wine into the indirect tax zone; and

     * (b) New Zealand and Australian taxes including customs duties.

    * (2) The maximum amount of *producer rebates to which a *producer is entitled for a *financial year under this Division is $500,000.

    * (3) However, if the *producer is an *associated producer of one or more other producers for a *financial year, the maximum amount of *producer rebates to which those producers are entitled as a group for the financial year under this Division is $500,000.

##### 1917  Earlier producer rebates

    * (1) Despite section 1915, if any of the wine was *manufactured using other wine, the amount of the *producer rebates to which you would be entitled under that section is reduced by the sum of the amounts of any *earlier producer rebates relating to the wine.

    * (2) An **_earlier producer rebate_** relating to wine is:

     * (a) if you are notified under subsection (3) of the amount of the producer's *producer rebate for other wine that was used to *manufacture the wine--so much of that producer rebate as relates to the amount of the other wine so used; or

     * (b) if you are not notified under subsection (3) in relation to other wine that was used to *manufacture the wine--an amount equal to what would have been so much of the producer's producer rebate for the other wine as relates to the amount of the other wine so used if:

      * (i) the producer had been entitled to a producer rebate for a *wholesale sale of the other wine to you; and

      * (ii) subsections 1915(2) and (3) and this section did not affect the amount of that producer rebate.

    * There is no earlier producer rebate in relation to other wine that was used to manufacture the wine if you are notified under subsection (3) that the producer of the other wine is not entitled to a producer rebate for the other wine.

        * Example: Winemaker A makes a wholesale sale of 100 litres of wine that it has manufactured to Winemaker B for $200. Winemaker B uses that wine to manufacture 100 litres of wine and then sells 30 litres to a distributor for $100.

        * Winemaker A has a rebate of $58 (assuming that it is not reduced because of an earlier producer rebate, and that Winemaker A has not already had the maximum rebate).

        * Winemaker B's rebate for the $100 sale of 30 litres to the distributor would be $29. However, Winemaker A's earlier producer rebate reduces Winemaker B's rebate for the 30 litres by $17.40 (30/100 x $58). Winemaker B's rebate is therefore $11.60. (It does not matter whether Winemaker A notifies Winemaker B of the earlier producer rebate.)

        * If Winemaker A had not been entitled to any producer rebate, and Winemaker B had been notified accordingly, Winemaker B's rebate for the $100 sale would have been $29.

    * (3) The *producer of the other wine, or (if the producer did not *supply the other wine to you) the supplier of the other wine, may notify you, in the *approved form, that:

     * (a) the producer is entitled to a *producer rebate of a specified amount for the other wine; or

     * (b) the producer is not entitled to a producer rebate for the other wine.

    * (4) If the *supply of other wine includes wine of 2 or more types of wine, subsection (3) applies as if there were separate supplies for each type of wine.

    * (5) For the purposes of subsection (2), if the only reason why an entity is not, or would not be, entitled to a *producer rebate for other wine is that paragraph 195(2)(c) has not yet been complied with:

     * (a) the entity is taken to be entitled to the rebate for the other wine; and

     * (b) the amount of that rebate is taken to be an amount equal to 29% of the approved selling price for the other wine.

##### 1920  Associated producers

    * (1) A *producer is an **_associated producer_** of another producer for a *financial year if, at the end of that financial year:

     * (a) the producer would be *connected with the other producer if subsection 328125(8) of the *ITAA 1997 were omitted; or

     * (b) the producer:

      * (i) is under an obligation (whether formal or informal); or

      * (ii) might reasonably be expected;

     * to act in accordance with the directions, instructions or wishes (however communicated) of the other producer in relation to the first producer's financial affairs; or

     * (c) the other producer:

      * (i) is under an obligation (whether formal or informal); or

      * (ii) might reasonably be expected;

     * to act in accordance with the directions, instructions or wishes (however communicated) of the first producer in relation to the other producer's financial affairs.

    * (2) 2 *producers are **_associated producers_** if each of them:

     * (a) is under an obligation (whether formal or informal); or

     * (b) might reasonably be expected;

    * to act in accordance with the directions, instructions or wishes (however communicated) of the same third entity in relation to their financial affairs.

    * (3) A *producer is an **_associated producer_** of another producer if:

     * (a) the first producer:

      * (i) is under an obligation (whether formal or informal); or

      * (ii) might reasonably be expected;

     * to act in accordance with the directions, instructions or wishes (however communicated) of a third producer in relation to the first producer's financial affairs; and

     * (b) the third producer:

      * (i) is under an obligation (whether formal or informal); or

      * (ii) might reasonably be expected;

     * to act in accordance with the directions, instructions or wishes (however communicated) of the other producer in relation to the third producer's financial affairs.

##### 1925  Excess claims

    * (1) If the sum of the amounts of *producer rebates that you claim because of subsection 195(1) for *tax periods during the *financial year exceeds the amount of the *producer rebates to which you are entitled in respect of the financial year, you are liable to pay an amount equal to that excess.

    * (1A) If the sum of the amounts of *producer rebates that you claim because of subsection 195(2) for the *financial year exceeds the amount of the producer rebates to which you are entitled in respect of that financial year, you are liable to pay an amount equal to that excess.

    * (2) Subsection (3) applies if a *producer is an *associated producer of one or more other producers for a *financial year and the *producer rebates claimed by those producers as a group for the financial year under this Division is more than $500,000.

    * (3) Each *producer member of the group is jointly and severally liable to pay an amount equal to the excess. However, none of the individual producer members is liable to pay an amount that exceeds the sum of the amounts of *producer rebates that that producer claimed for the *financial year.

    * (4) An amount payable under this section is to be treated as if it were wine tax payable at the end of the *financial year, and, except in the case of a *New Zealand participant, for the purposes of Part 5, were attributable to the last tax period of the financial year.

        * Note: The main effect of treating the amount as if it were wine tax is to apply the collection and recovery rules in Part 310 in Schedule 1 to the _Taxation Administration Act 1953_.

    * (5) For the purposes of the application of Parts 310 and 41 in Schedule 1 to the _Taxation Administration Act 1953_, a *producer rebate under subsection 195(2) is to be treated as a net amount_._

##### _1928  Obligations relating to certain wholesale sales

    * (1) A person commits an offence if:

     * (a) the person gives a notice under subsection 1917(3), or a notice that purports to be a notice under subsection 1917(3); and

     * (b) the notice contains a statement that:

      * (i) is false or misleading in a material particular; or

      * (ii) omits any matter or thing without which the statement is false or misleading in a material particular.

      * Penalty: 20 penalty units.

        * Note 1: Chapter 2 of the _Criminal Code_ sets out the general principles of criminal responsibility.

        * Note 2: See section 4AA of the _Crimes Act 1914 _for the current value of a penalty unit.

    * (2) Subsection (1) is an offence of strict liability.

        * Note: For strict liability, see section 6.1 of the _Criminal Code_.

##### 1930  Obligation of purchasers

    * A person commits an offence if: 

     * (a) the person purchases wine from a *producer and *quotes for the purchase; and

     * (b) the person intends, at the time of the purchase, to make a supply of the wine that will be *GSTfree; and

     * (c) the person does not notify the producer, in the *approved form, of that intention at or before the time of the purchase.

      * Penalty: 20 penalty units.

        * Note 1: Chapter 2 of the _Criminal Code_ sets out the general principles of criminal responsibility.

        * Note 2: See section 4AA of the _Crimes Act 1914 _for the current value of a penalty unit.

### Part 5--Payments and refunds of wine tax

#### Division 21--Inclusion of wine tax and wine tax credits in net amounts

##### Table of Subdivisions

     * 21A	General

     * 21B	Members of GST groups

     * 21C	Participants in GST joint ventures

##### 211  What this Division is about

    * Wine tax (except wine tax on customs dealings) is added to net amounts under the GST Act. Wine tax credits are subtracted from those net amounts.

        * Note: Division 165 (Antiavoidance) of the GST Act will cover avoidance schemes relating to wine tax so far as they affect net amounts, because such schemes affect amounts payable under the GST Act.

##### Subdivision 21A--General

##### 215  Net amounts increased by amounts of wine tax

    * (1) Your *net amount for a *tax period is *increased by the sum of all of the amounts of wine tax (if any) payable by you that are attributable to that tax period.

    * (2) However, this section does not apply to wine tax payable on *customs dealings.

        * Note: This section has the effect of incorporating your liability for the wine tax (other than wine tax on customs dealings) into the amount of GST that you are liable to pay under Division 33 of the GST Act, or into the amount of refund to which you are entitled under Division 35 of the GST Act.

##### 2110  Attribution rules for wine tax

    * (1) The wine tax payable by you on a *taxable dealing that is a *supply is attributable to the same *tax period, or tax periods, applying to you as the tax period or tax periods to which:

     * (a) if the supply is a *taxable supply--the taxable supply is attributable; or

     * (b) if the supply is not a taxable supply--the supply would be attributable if it were a taxable supply.

        * For the basic rules on attribution of taxable supplies, see section 295 of the GST Act.

    * (2) The wine tax payable by you on a *taxable dealing that is not a *supply is attributable to the *tax period during which the time of dealing occurs, as specified in column 4 of the *Assessable Dealings Table.

##### 2115  Net amounts reduced by amounts of wine tax credits

    * Your *net amount for a *tax period is *reduced by the sum of all of the amounts of *wine tax credits (if any) to which you are entitled that arise during that tax period.

        * Note 1: This section has the effect of incorporating your entitlement to wine tax credits into the amount of GST that you are liable to pay under Division 33 of the GST Act, or into the amount of refund to which you are entitled under Division 35 of the GST Act.

        * Note 2: If you are not registered or required to be registered (and therefore do not have net amounts), you can claim wine tax credits to which you are entitled directly from the Commissioner (see subsection 1710(2)).

##### Subdivision 21B--Members of GST groups

##### 2140  Who is liable for wine tax

    * (1) Wine tax payable on a *taxable dealing for which a *member of a *GST group would (apart from this section) be liable to the tax:

     * (a) is payable by the *representative member; and

     * (b) is not payable by the member that would be so liable (unless the member is the representative member).

    * (2) However, if the member is not the *representative member of the *GST group, this section only applies to wine tax payable on a *customs dealing if the tax is payable at a time when wine tax on *taxable dealings is normally payable by the representative member.

    * (3) This section has effect despite subsection 55(2) (which is about liability for wine tax).

##### 2145  Who is entitled to wine tax credits

    * (1) If a *member of a *GST group would (apart from this section) be entitled to a *wine tax credit:

     * (a) the *representative member is entitled to the wine tax credit; and

     * (b) the member that would be so entitled is not entitled to the wine tax credit (unless the member is the representative member).

     * (a) is payable by the joint venture operator; and

     * (b) is not payable by the other participant.

    * (2) This section has effect despite subsection 55(2) (which is about liability for wine tax).

##### 2175  Who is entitled to wine tax credits

     * (a) the joint venture operator is entitled to the wine tax credit; and

     * (b) the participant that would be so entitled is not entitled to the wine tax credit (unless the participant is the joint venture operator).

    * (2) This section has effect despite section 175 (which is about entitlement to wine tax credits).

##### 2180  Additional net amounts relating to GST joint ventures

    * The additional net amount relating to a *GST joint venture in section 5145 of the *GST Act:

     * (a) is increased by the amount of any wine tax on *taxable dealings for which the *joint venture operator is liable because of section 2170; and

     * (b) is decreased by the amount of any *wine tax credits to which the joint venture operator is entitled because of section 2175.

#### Division 23--Wine tax on customs dealings

##### 231  What this Division is about

    * Wine tax on a customs dealing is not included in net amounts. Generally speaking, it is paid together with customs duty. (This is consistent with payment of assessed GST on taxable importations.)

##### 235  Payment of wine tax on customs dealings

    * (1) Amounts of *assessed wine tax on *customs dealings are to be paid to the Commonwealth:

     * (a) at the same time, at the same place, and in the same manner, as *customs duty is payable on the wine in question (or would be payable if the wine were subject to customs duty); or

     * (b) in the circumstances specified in the regulations, within such further time specified in the regulations, and at the place and in the manner specified in the regulations.

         * Note 1: The regulations could (for example) allow for deferral of payments to coincide with payments of assessed net amounts.

         * Note 1A: For provisions about assessment of wine tax on customs dealings, see Division 155 in Schedule 1 to the _Taxation Administration Act 1953_.

         * Note 2: For provisions about collection and recovery of assessed wine tax on customs dealings, see Subdivision 105C, and Part 415, in Schedule 1 to the _Taxation Administration Act 1953_.

    * (2) An officer of Customs (within the meaning of subsection 4(1) of the _Customs Act 1901_) may refuse to deliver the goods concerned unless the *assessed wine tax has been paid.

##### 2310  Application of Division 165 of the GST Act

    * Division 165 of the *GST Act applies to amounts that are payable under this Division as if they were amounts payable under the GST Act.

     * (e) such proportion of that amount of wine tax as is specified in the regulations.

    * Working out amounts of wine tax borne

    * (2) The regulations may specify how amounts of *wine tax borne are to be worked out.

    * Paying the refund

    * (3) An amount payable under this section is payable within the period and in the manner specified in the regulations.

##### 2510  Purchases later found to be GSTfree supplies

    * (1) If:

     * (a) you are paid an amount under subsection 255(1A) for a purchase; and

### Part 6--Miscellaneous

#### Division 27--Miscellaneous

##### 275  Wine tax must be specified on invoice for wholesale sales

    * (1) If you sell wine by *wholesale at a *price that includes wine tax that you have or will become liable to pay on the wine, you must specify the amount of the tax on any invoice given to the purchaser.

    * (2) You commit an offence if you contravene this section.

      * Penalty: 20 penalty units.

        * Note 1: Chapter 2 of the _Criminal Code_ sets out the general principles of criminal responsibility.

        * Note 2: See section 4AA of the _Crimes Act 1914 _for the current value of a penalty unit.

##### 2710  Alteration of wine tax liability or wine tax credit if affected by nonarm's length transaction

    * (1) This section applies to you if:

     * (a) you (or your *associate) has been a party to a nonarm's length transaction; and

     * (b) if the transaction had instead been an arm's length transaction, it would have been the case (or could reasonably be expected to have been the case) that:

      * (i) your liability to wine tax on the nonarm's length transaction, or any other transaction, would have been *increased; or

      * (ii) your entitlement to a *wine tax credit in connection with the nonarm's length transaction, or any other transaction, would have been *reduced.

    * (2) The liability or *wine tax credit is taken always to have been the amount that it would have been (or could reasonably be expected to have been) if it had been based on an arm's length transaction instead of on the nonarm's length transaction.

##### 2715  Apportionment of global amounts

    * (1) If there is a need to know the *price for which particular wine was sold, but the parties have not allocated a particular amount to the wine, the price for which the wine was sold is (for the purposes of the *wine tax law) the price for which the wine could reasonably be expected to have been sold if it had been sold separately.

    * (2) Similarly, if there is a need to know how much of a global amount relates to some other element of a transaction, but the parties have not allocated a particular amount to that element, the amount to be allocated to that element (for the purposes of the *wine tax law) is the amount that could reasonably be expected to have been allocated to that element if that element had been the only subject matter of the transaction.

##### 2720  Commonwealth etc. not liable to pay wine tax

    * (1) The Commonwealth and *untaxable Commonwealth entities are not liable to pay wine tax payable under this Act. However, it is the Parliament's intention that the Commonwealth and untaxable Commonwealth entities should:

     * (a) be notionally liable to pay wine tax payable under this Act; and

     * (b) be notionally entitled to *wine tax credits arising under this Act.

    * (2) The *Finance Minister may give such written directions as are necessary or convenient for carrying out or giving effect to subsection (1) and, in particular, may give directions in relation to the transfer of *money within an account, or between accounts, operated by the Commonwealth or an *untaxable Commonwealth entity.

    * (2A) The directions given under subsection (2) may also take account of the provisions of the _A New Tax System (Wine Equalisation Tax and Luxury Car Tax Transition) Act 1999_.

    * (3) Directions under subsection (2) have effect, and must be complied with, despite any other Commonwealth law.

##### 2725  Cancellation of exemptions from wine tax

    * (1) This section cancels the effect of a provision of another Act that would have the effect of exempting a person from liability to pay wine tax payable under this Act.

    * (2) The cancellation does not apply if the provision of the other Act:

     * (a) commences after this section commences; and

     * (b) refers specifically to wine tax payable under this Act.
