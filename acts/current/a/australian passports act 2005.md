     * (c) the Minister is satisfied that:

      * (i) the child urgently needs to travel internationally because of a family crisis; and

      * (ii) if there is a person who has parental responsibility for the child and whose consent to the child travelling internationally has not been given--it is not possible to contact that person within a reasonable period; or

     * (d) in the case of a child who is outside Australia--the child departed Australia less than 12 months before the application for the passport was made and the Minister considers that a passport should be issued to enable the child's return to Australia.

    * (3) If the Minister refuses to issue a passport to a child, the Minister may declare that he or she is refusing to exercise the discretion under subsection (2) because the matter should be dealt with by a court.

      * (ii) has not ceased to have parental responsibility for the child because of an order made under the _Family Law Act 1975_; or

         * Note: The presumptions in the _Family Law Act 1975_ include a presumption arising from a court finding that a person is the child's parent, and a presumption arising from a man executing an instrument under law acknowledging that he is the father of the child.

    * the competent authority may make a refusal/cancellation request in relation to the person.

        * Note: See also Subdivision D.

    * (2) If a competent authority makes a request under subsection (1), the Minister must not issue an Australian passport to the person.

    * (3) In this section:

    * **_competent authority_**, in relation to a circumstance mentioned in paragraph (1)(a) or (b), means:

     * (a) a person who has responsibility for, or powers, functions or duties in relation to, that circumstance under a law of the Commonwealth, a State or Territory (other than a person who is specified in a Minister's determination as not being a competent authority in relation to the circumstance); or

     * (b) a person specified in a Minister's determination as a competent authority in relation to the circumstance.

##### 13  Reasons relating to international law enforcement cooperation

      * (iii) a law of a foreign country, or an order or other direction (however described) under a law of a foreign country; or

     * (c) if an Australian passport were issued to a person, it is likely that proceedings (of any kind) under a law of a foreign country in relation to a serious foreign offence that the person committed, or is alleged to have committed, would be compromised;

    * the competent authority may make a refusal/cancellation request in relation to the person.

        * Note: See also Subdivision D.

    * **_serious foreign offence_** means an offence against the law of a foreign country:

     * (a) for which the maximum penalty is death or imprisonment, or other deprivation of liberty, for a period of not less than 12 months; or

     * (b) if the offence does not carry a penalty under the law of the country--the conduct constituting which is, under a treaty to which the country and Australia are parties (being a treaty relating in whole or in part to the surrender of persons accused or convicted of offences), required to be treated as an offence for which the surrender of persons is allowed by the country or Australia; or

     * (c) the conduct constituting which would, if engaged in in Australia, constitute an indictable offence against this Act; or

     * (d) the conduct constituting which would, if engaged in in Australia, constitute an offence specified in a Minister's determination made for the purposes of subparagraph 14(1)(a)(v).

##### 14  Reasons relating to potential for harmful conduct

    * (1) If a competent authority suspects on reasonable grounds that:

     * (a) if an Australian passport were issued to a person, the person would be likely to engage in conduct that:

      * (i) might prejudice the security of Australia or a foreign country; or

      * (ii) might endanger the health or physical safety of other persons (whether in Australia or a foreign country); or

      * (iii) might interfere with the rights or freedoms of other persons (whether in Australia or a foreign country) set out in the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights; or

      * (iv) might constitute an indictable offence against this Act; or

      * (v) might constitute an indictable offence against a law of the Commonwealth, being an offence specified in a Minister's determination; and

     * (b) the person should be refused an Australian passport in order to prevent the person from engaging in the conduct;

    * the competent authority may make a refusal/cancellation request in relation to the person.

        * Note 1: The text of the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights is set out in Australian Treaty Series 1980 No. 23. In 2005 this was available in the Australian Treaties Library of the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade, accessible through that Department's website.

        * Note 2: See also Subdivision D.

    * (2) If a competent authority makes a request under subsection (1), the Minister may refuse to issue the person an Australian passport.

    * (3) In this section:

    * **_competent authority_**:

     * (a) in relation to a circumstance mentioned in subsection (1) that relates to Australia, means:

      * (i) a person who has responsibility for, or powers, duties or functions in relation to, the circumstance under a law of the Commonwealth, a State or Territory (other than a person who is specified in a Minister's determination as not being a competent authority in relation to the circumstance); or

      * (ii) a person specified in a Minister's determination as a competent authority in relation to the circumstance; or

     * (b) in relation to a circumstance mentioned in subsection (1) that relates to a foreign country, means:

      * (i) an officer within the meaning of paragraph (a), (b) or (c) of the definition of **_officer_** in subsection 6(1); or

      * (ii) an employee of the Commonwealth who is specified in a Minister's determination as a competent authority in relation to the circumstance; or

      * (iii) a noncorporate Commonwealth entity (within the meaning of the _Public Governance, Performance and Accountability Act 2013_) that is specified in a Minister's determination as a competent authority in relation to the circumstance.

##### Subdivision C--Administrative reasons

    * The Minister may refuse to issue an Australian passport to a person if, in the 5 years before the passport application under consideration is made, 2 or more Australian passports issued to the person have been lost or stolen.

##### 16  Reasons relating to financial assistance to travellers

    * (1) If a competent authority believes on reasonable grounds that a person (the **_debtor_**) owes money to the Commonwealth in respect of:

     * (a) expenses incurred by the Commonwealth on behalf of the debtor in a foreign country; or

     * (b) money lent to the debtor by the Commonwealth when the debtor was outside Australia; or

     * (c) expenses incurred by the Commonwealth in, or in connection with, effecting the debtor's departure from a foreign country;

    * the competent authority may make a refusal/cancellation request in relation to the debtor.

        * Note: See also Subdivision D.

    * (2) If a competent authority makes a request under subsection (1), the Minister must not issue an Australian passport to the debtor.

    * (3) Subsection (2) does not prevent the Minister from issuing an Australian passport to the debtor if the Minister is satisfied:

    * (1) The Minister must not issue an Australian passport to a person if the person has already been issued with an Australian travel document and that document is still valid or is suspended under section 22A.

    * (2) Subsection (1) does not prevent the Minister from issuing an Australian passport to the person in the circumstances specified in a Minister's determination.

##### Subdivision D--Matters relating to requests by competent authorities

##### 18  Refusal/cancellation requests

    * (1) For the purposes of this Act, a **_refusal/cancellation request_** is a request made to the Minister under subsection 12(1), 13(1), 14(1) or 16(1) by a competent authority, being a request that the Minister do either or both of the following:

     * (a) refuse to issue an Australian passport to a person;

     * (b) cancel an Australian passport or travelrelated document that has been issued to a person.

    * (2) A competent authority may make a refusal/cancellation request in relation to a person:

     * (a) whether or not the person has applied for an Australian passport; and

     * (b) whether or not an Australian travel document has been issued to the person; and

     * (c) whether or not the person is an Australian citizen.

    * (3) To avoid doubt, a competent authority may suspect on reasonable grounds that circumstances in subsection 14(1) apply in relation to a person, even if the competent authority knows that the person has already been issued with an Australian passport.
