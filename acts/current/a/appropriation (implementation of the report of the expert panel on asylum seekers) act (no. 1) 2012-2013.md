### An Act to appropriate additional money out of the Consolidated Revenue Fund for the ordinary annual services of the Government in relation to implementation of the Report of the Expert Panel on Asylum Seekers, and for related purposes

##### [Assented to 28 November 2012]

### The Parliament of Australia enacts: 

### Part 1--Preliminary

##### 1  Short title

    * This Act may be cited as the _Appropriation (Implementation of the Report of the Expert Panel on Asylum Seekers) Act (No. 1) 2012-2013_.

##### 2  Commencement

    * This Act commences on the day this Act receives the Royal Assent.

##### 3  Definitions

    * In this Act: 

    * **_administered item_** means an amount set out in Schedule 1 opposite an outcome for an Agency under the heading "Administered".

    * **_Agency_** means:

      * (a) an Agency within the meaning of the _Financial Management and Accountability Act 1997_; or

      * (b) the High Court of Australia.

    * **_Chief Executive_** has the same meaning as in the _Financial Management and Accountability Act 1997_.

    * **_current year_** means the financial year ending on 30 June 2013.

    * **_departmental item_** means the total amount set out in Schedule 1 in relation to an Agency under the heading "Departmental".

       * Note: The amounts set out opposite outcomes, under the heading "Departmental", are "notional". They are not part of the item, and do not in any way restrict the scope of the expenditure authorised by the item.

    * **_expenditure_** means payments for expenses, acquiring assets, making loans or paying liabilities.

    * **_Finance Minister_** means the Minister administering this Act.

    * **_item_** means an administered item or a departmental item.

    * **_Portfolio Budget Statements_** means the Portfolio Budget Statements that were tabled in the Senate or the House of Representatives in relation to the Bill for the _Appropriation Act (No. 1) 2012-2013 _and the Bill for the _Appropriation Act (No. 2) 2012-2013_.

    * **_Portfolio Statements_** means:

      * (a) the Portfolio Budget Statements; and

      * (b) the Portfolio Supplementary Estimates Statements.

    * **_Portfolio Supplementary Estimates Statements_** means the Portfolio Supplementary Estimates Statements that were tabled in the Senate or the House of Representatives in relation to the Bill for this Act and the Bill for the _Appropriation (Implementation of the Report of the Expert Panel on Asylum Seekers) Act (No. 2) 2012-2013_.

    * **_Special Account_** has the same meaning as in the _Financial Management and Accountability Act 1997_.

##### 4  Portfolio Statements

    * The Portfolio Statements are hereby declared to be relevant documents for the purposes of section 15AB of the _Acts Interpretation Act 1901_.

       * Note: See paragraph 15AB(2)(g) of the _Acts Interpretation Act 1901_.

##### 5  Notional payments, receipts etc.

    * For the purposes of this Act, notional transactions between Agencies are to be treated as if they were real transactions.

       * Note: This section applies, for example, to a "payment" between Agencies that are both part of the Commonwealth. One of the effects of this section is that the payment will be debited from an appropriation for the paying Agency, even though no payment is actually made from the Consolidated Revenue Fund.
       * 


### Part 2--Appropriation items

##### 6  Summary of appropriations

    * The total of the items specified in Schedule 1 is $1,407,002,000.

       * Note 1: Items in Schedule 1 can be adjusted under Part 3 of this Act.

       * Note 2: Sections 30 to 32 of the _Financial Management and Accountability Act 1997_ also provide for adjustments of amounts appropriated by this Act.

##### 7  Departmental items

    * The amount specified in a departmental item for an Agency may be applied for the departmental expenditure of the Agency.

       * Note: The Finance Minister manages the expenditure of public money through the issue of drawing rights under the _Financial Management and Accountability Act 1997_.

##### 8  Administered items

    * (1) The amount specified in an administered item for an outcome for an Agency may be applied for expenditure for the purpose of contributing to achieving that outcome.

       * Note: The Finance Minister manages the expenditure of public money through the issue of drawing rights under the _Financial Management and Accountability Act 1997_.

    * (2) If the Portfolio Statements indicate that activities of a particular kind were intended to be treated as activities in respect of a particular outcome, then expenditure for the purpose of carrying out those activities is taken to be expenditure for the purpose of contributing to achieving the outcome.

### Part 3--Adjusting appropriation items

##### 9  Reducing departmental items

    * (1) A written request to reduce a departmental item for an Agency may be made to the Finance Minister by:

      * (a) the Prime Minister or a Minister acting on behalf of the Prime Minister; or

      * (b) the Minister who is responsible for the Agency; or

      * (c) if the Finance Minister is responsible for the Agency--the Chief Executive of the Agency.

    * (2) If a request is made under subsection (1), the Finance Minister may, by writing, determine that the item is to be reduced by the amount specified in the request.

    * (3) However, the determination has no effect to the extent that it would reduce the item below nil, after subtracting amounts that have been applied under Part 2 in respect of the item.

    * (4) The item is taken to be reduced in accordance with the determination.

    * (5) Despite subsection 33(3) of the _Acts Interpretation Act 1901_, the determination must not be rescinded, revoked, amended or varied.

    * (6) A request made under subsection (1) is not a legislative instrument.

    * (7) A determination made under subsection (2) is a legislative instrument and, despite subsection 44(2) of the _Legislative Instruments Act 2003_, section 42 (disallowance) of that Act applies to the determination. However, Part 6 (sunsetting) of that Act does not apply to the determination.

##### 10  Reducing administered items

    * (1) If:

      * (a) an annual report for an Agency for the current year is tabled in the Parliament; and

      * (b) the report specifies the amount required by the Agency in respect of an administered item for the Agency; and

      * (c) the required amount is less than the amount of the item;

    * the item is taken to be reduced to the required amount.

    * (2) The Finance Minister may, by writing:

      * (a) determine that subsection (1):

       * (i) does not apply in relation to the item; or

       * (ii) applies as if the amount specified in the annual report were the amount specified in the determination; or

      * (b) if the report does not specify the required amount--determine an amount that is taken to be the required amount for the purposes of subsection (1).

    * (3) A determination made under subsection (2) is a legislative instrument and, despite subsection 44(2) of the _Legislative Instruments Act 2003_, section 42 (disallowance) of that Act applies to the determination. However, Part 6 (sunsetting) of that Act does not apply to the determination.

### Part 4--Miscellaneous

##### 11  Crediting amounts to Special Accounts

    * If any of the purposes of a Special Account is a purpose that is covered by an item (whether or not the item expressly refers to the Special Account), then amounts may be debited against the appropriation for that item and credited to that Special Account.

##### 12  Appropriation of the Consolidated Revenue Fund

    * The Consolidated Revenue Fund is appropriated as necessary for the purposes of this Act, including the operation of this Act as affected by the _Financial Management and Accountability Act 1997_.
