    * (b) amounts of penalty paid under section 15 of the _Primary Industries Levies and Charges Collection Act 1991_ in relation to a failure to pay Australian Animal Health Council levy by the time it became due for payment.

   * (2) The Commonwealth is to pay to the Australian Animal Health Council an amount equal to the sum of the following amounts:

    * (a) amounts of levy or charge:

     * (i) imposed by regulations under Schedule 27 to the _Primary Industries (Excise) Levies Act 1999_ or Schedule 14 to the _Primary Industries (Customs) Charges Act 1999_ on an animal product (as defined in whichever one of those Schedules is relevant); and

     * (ii) described in those regulations as EADR levy or EADR charge; and

     * (iii) collected or received by or on behalf of the Commonwealth;

    * (b) amounts of penalty paid under section 15 of the _Primary Industries Levies and Charges Collection Act 1991_ in relation to a failure to pay levy or charge described in paragraph (a) by the time it became due for payment.

   * _Conditions of Commonwealth payment_

   * _	(2A)	The payments made under subsection (2) are subject to the condition that the Australian Animal Health Council will pay to the Commonwealth an amount equal to the Commonwealth's costs in:

    * (a) collecting or recovering the amounts of levy, charge or penalty to which the payments relate; and

    * (b) administering subsection (2) in relation to the making of the payments.

   * (3) A payment (the **_Commonwealth payment_**) under subsection (2) relating to a levy or charge and to an animal product is made subject to the condition that the Australian Animal Health Council apply the Commonwealth payment in accordance with the priorities in subsections (3A), (4), (5) and (6) and subject to subsections (7) and (8).

   * (3A) The first priority is to apply the Commonwealth payment in making a payment to the Commonwealth for the purpose of discharging any liability of the Australian Animal Health Council under subsection (2A).

   * (4) The second priority is to apply the Commonwealth payment in meeting, or reimbursing the Australian Animal Health Council for meeting, costs the Council incurs:

    * (a) in receiving and applying the Commonwealth payment in accordance with subsection (3); and

    * (b) before or in the financial year in which the Commonwealth payment is made.

   * (5) The third priority is to apply the Commonwealth payment in making, on behalf of the non-government body that is a party to the EADR agreement and is concerned with the production of the animal product, a payment:

    * (a) to the Commonwealth for the purpose of discharging a liability of the body to the Commonwealth that arises under the EADR agreement; or

    * (b) if the animal product is honey--to the Commonwealth or Plant Health Australia Limited (ACN 092 607 997) for the purpose of discharging a liability of the body to the Commonwealth relating to the Commonwealth's costs connected with a plant disease that is, may be or may have been spread by honey bees.

     * Note: A payment to Plant Health Australia Limited may be made for the purpose of discharging a liability of the non-government body concerned with honey production to the Commonwealth relating to a plant disease spread by honey bees if Plant Health Australia Limited is obliged to pay the Commonwealth on behalf of the body.

   * (6) The fourth priority is to apply the Commonwealth payment in:

    * (a) making a payment to an organisation that is concerned with research and development relevant to production of the animal product; or

    * (b) taking measures relating to the promotion or maintenance of the health of animals to which the animal product relates.

   * (7) If a body is declared under the relevant Schedule mentioned in subparagraph (2)(a)(i) as the designated body for the animal product, the Australian Animal Health Council is to apply the Commonwealth payment in accordance with the fourth priority only:

    * (a) on request by the body; and

    * (b) in the way that the body requests.

   * (8) It is not a contravention of the condition in subsection (3) for the Australian Animal Health Council to apply the Commonwealth payment in accordance with a lower priority if the Council cannot apply the payment in accordance with a higher priority. For this purpose, a priority set out in a later subsection is lower than a priority set out in an earlier subsection.

   * _Recovery of Commonwealth costs_

   * _	(9)	An amount payable by the Australian Animal Health Council under subsection (2A):

    * (a) is a debt due to the Commonwealth; and

    * (b) before or in the financial year in which the payment is made.

   * _Third priority for applying Commonwealth payment_

   * _	(4)	As third priority, the Australian Animal Health Council is to apply the Commonwealth payment in making to the Commonwealth a payment (the **_Council payment_**) as follows, depending on whether, when the Commonwealth payment was made, a non-government body concerned with the horse industry was party to the EADR agreement:

    * (a) if such a body was party to the agreement--the Council payment is on behalf of the body for the purpose of discharging a liability of the body to the Commonwealth that arises under the EADR agreement;

    * (b) if there was not such a body party to the agreement--the Council payment is made within 28 days after the Commonwealth payment was made and equals so much of the payment to the Council as the Council has not applied under subsection (3).

   * _Fourth priority for applying Commonwealth payment_

   * _	(5)	As fourth priority, the Australian Animal Health Council is to apply the Commonwealth payment in:

    * (a) making a payment to an organisation that is concerned with research and development relevant to the horse industry; or

   * (6) The Australian Animal Health Council is to apply the Commonwealth payment under subsection (5) only:

   * _Applying for lower priority if higher priority cannot be met_

   * _	(7)	The Australian Animal Health Council may apply the Commonwealth payment in accordance with a lower priority if the Council cannot apply the payment in accordance with a higher priority.
