    * The Parliament acknowledges the important work of the Expert Panel on Constitutional Recognition of Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander peoples and its proposals for constitutional change.

    * The Parliament recognises that further engagement with Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander peoples and other Australians is required to refine proposals for a referendum and to build the support necessary for successful constitutional change.

    * The Parliament is committed to building the national consensus needed for the recognition of Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander peoples in our Constitution.

    * The Parliament believes this Act is a significant step in the process towards achieving constitutional change.

    * The Parliament of Australia enacts: 

##### 1  Short title
