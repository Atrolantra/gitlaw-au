### An Act to impose a levy on the landing of jet aircraft at certain airports


  * 1**  Short title **[_see_ Note 1]

  * This Act may be cited as the _Aircraft Noise Levy Act 1995_.

  * 2**  Commencement **[_see_ Note 1]

  * This Act commences on the day on which it receives the Royal Assent or on 1 July 1995, whichever is later.

##### 3  Definitions

  * An expression used in this Act and in the _Aircraft Noise Levy Collection Act 1995_ has the same meaning in this Act as it has in that Act.

##### 4  Act binds Crown

  * This Act binds the Crown in right of each of the States, of the Australian Capital Territory and of the Northern Territory.

##### 5  Imposition of levy

  * (1) Subject to subsection (2), levy is imposed on a landing.

  * (2) Levy is not imposed on a landing:

   *  (a) if the aircraft making the landing:

    * (i) is a state aircraft within the meaning of section 3 of the _Civil Aviation Act 1988_; or

    * (ii) has an assessed noise (as defined in subsection 6(1)) of less than 265; or

   * (b) if the landing is made as part of a flight for:

    * (i) a purpose that relates to the provision of emergency services and that is prescribed by the regulations; or

    * (ii) subject to any conditions prescribed by the regulations--the purpose of carrying goods or people for a registered charity in relation to the charitable activities of the registered charity.

  * (3) In this Act:

  * **_registered charity_** means an entity that is registered under the _Australian Charities and Not-for-profits Commission Act 2012_ as the type of entity mentioned in column 1 of item 1 of the table in subsection 25-5(5) of that Act.

##### 6  Amount of levy

  * (1) The amount of levy on a landing is worked out using the formula:

  * where: 

  * **_assessed noise_** means the number equal to the effective perceived noise level of the aircraft concerned, in Effective Perceived Noise Decibels, determined in accordance with the regulations;

  * **_levy unit_** means the amount worked out in accordance with the regulations.

  * (2) Without limiting subsection (1), the regulations may provide for the assessed noise for an aircraft to be determined having regard to either or both of the following:

   * (a) the type of the aircraft;

   * (b) the noise made by another aircraft of the same type at a test conducted before the landing on which the levy is imposed.

  * (3) The regulations made for the purposes of the definition of **_levy unit_** must not provide for an amount to be worked out that exceeds:

   * (a) if the amount applies in relation to a landing made in the financial year ending on 30 June 1996--$180.00; or

   * (b) if the amount applies in relation to a landing made in a later financial year--110% of the maximum amount that could have been provided for by regulations in relation to a landing in the immediately preceding financial year.

  * (4) The regulations made for the purposes of the definition of **_levy unit_** must provide for only one amount to apply to all landings made during a particular period (regardless of where each of the landings is made).

##### 7  Person liable for levy

  * Levy imposed by section 5 on a landing is payable by the operator of the jet aircraft that made the landing.

##### 8  Regulations

  * The Governor-General may make regulations for the purposes of sections 5 and 6.
