# Appropriation Act (No. 1) 2015-2016

#### No. 76, 2015

### An Act to appropriate money out of the Consolidated Revenue Fund for the ordinary annual services of the Government, and for related purposes

##### [Assented to 26 June 2015]

### The Parliament of Australia enacts: 

### Part 1--Preliminary

##### 1  Short title

    * This Act may be cited as the _Appropriation Act (No. 1) 20152016_.

##### 2  Commencement

    * This Act commences on the day this Act receives the Royal Assent.

##### 3  Definitions

    * In this Act: 

    * **_administered item_** means an amount set out in Schedule 1 opposite an outcome for a noncorporate entity under the heading "Administered".

    * **_corporate entity_** means:

     * (a) a corporate Commonwealth entity within the meaning of the _Public Governance, Performance and Accountability Act 2013_; or

     * (b) a Commonwealth company within the meaning of that Act.

    * **_corporate entity item_** means the total amount set out in Schedule 1 in relation to a corporate entity under the heading "Administered".

      * Note: The amounts set out opposite outcomes for corporate entities, under the heading "Administered", are "notional". They are not part of the item, and do not in any way restrict the scope of the expenditure authorised by the item.

    * **_current year_** means the financial year ending on 30 June 2016.

    * **_departmental item_** means the total amount set out in Schedule 1 in relation to a noncorporate entity under the heading "Departmental".

      * Note: The amounts set out opposite outcomes, under the heading "Departmental", are "notional". They are not part of the item, and do not in any way restrict the scope of the expenditure authorised by the item.

    * **_expenditure_** means payments for expenses, acquiring assets, making loans or paying liabilities.

    * **_Finance Minister_** means the Minister administering this Act.

    * **_item_** means any of the following:

     * (a) an administered item;

     * (b) a corporate entity item;

     * (c) a departmental item.

    * **_noncorporate entity_** means:

     * (a) a noncorporate Commonwealth entity within the meaning of the _Public Governance, Performance and Accountability Act 2013_; or

     * (b) the High Court.

    * **_Portfolio Budget Statements_** means the Portfolio Budget Statements that were tabled in the Senate or the House of Representatives in relation to the Bill for this Act.

    * **_portfolio statements_** means the Portfolio Budget Statements.

    * **_special account_** has the same meaning as in the _Public Governance, Performance and Accountability Act 2013_.

##### 4  Portfolio statements

    * The portfolio statements are declared to be relevant documents for the purposes of section 15AB of the _Acts Interpretation Act 1901_.

      * Note: See paragraph 15AB(2)(g) of the _Acts Interpretation Act 1901_ which provides that the material that may be considered in the interpretation of a provision of an Act includes any document that is declared by the Act to be a relevant document.

##### 5  Notional transactions between entities that are part of the Commonwealth

    * For the purposes of this Act, notional transactions between noncorporate entities are to be treated as if they were real transactions.

      * Note: This section applies, for example, to a "payment" between noncorporate entities that are both part of the Commonwealth. One of the effects of this section is that the payment will be debited from an appropriation for the paying noncorporate entity, even though no payment is actually made from the Consolidated Revenue Fund. This is consistent with section 76 of the _Public Governance, Performance and Accountability Act 2013_.

### Part 2--Appropriation items

##### 6  Summary of appropriations

    * The total of the items specified in Schedule 1 is $80,966,414,000.

      * Note 1: Items in Schedule 1 can be adjusted under Part 3 of this Act.

      * Note 2: Sections 74 to 75 of the _Public Governance, Performance and Accountability Act 2013_ also provide for the adjustment of amounts appropriated by this Act.

##### 7  Departmental items

    * The amount specified in a departmental item for a noncorporate entity may be applied for the departmental expenditure of the entity.

##### 8  Administered items

    * (1) The amount specified in an administered item for an outcome for a noncorporate entity may be applied for expenditure for the purpose of contributing to achieving that outcome.

    * (2) If the portfolio statements indicate that activities of a particular kind were intended to be treated as activities in respect of a particular outcome, then expenditure for the purpose of carrying out those activities is taken to be expenditure for the purpose of contributing to achieving the outcome.

##### 9  Corporate entity items

    * (1) The amount specified in a corporate entity item for a corporate entity may be paid to the entity to be applied for the purposes of the entity.

    * (2) If:

     * (a) an Act provides that a corporate entity must be paid amounts that are appropriated by the Parliament for the purposes of the entity; and

     * (b) Schedule 1 contains a corporate entity item for that entity;

    * then the entity must be paid the full amount specified in the item.

### Part 3--Advance to the Finance Minister

##### 10  Advance to the Finance Minister

    * (1) This section applies if the Finance Minister is satisfied that there is an urgent need for expenditure, in the current year, that is not provided for, or is insufficiently provided for, in Schedule 1:

     * (a) because of an erroneous omission or understatement; or

     * (b) because the expenditure was unforeseen until after the last day on which it was practicable to provide for it in the Bill for this Act before that Bill was introduced into the House of Representatives.

    * (2) This Act has effect as if Schedule 1 were amended, in accordance with a determination of the Finance Minister, to make provision for so much (if any) of the expenditure as the Finance Minister determines.

    * (3) The total of the amounts determined under subsection (2) cannot be more than $295 million.

    * (4) A determination made under subsection (2) is a legislative instrument, but neither section 42 (disallowance) nor Part 6 (sunsetting) of the _Legislative Instruments Act 2003_ applies to the determination.

### Part 4--Miscellaneous

##### 11  Crediting amounts to special accounts

    * If any of the purposes of a special account is a purpose that is covered by an item (whether or not the item expressly refers to the special account), then amounts may be debited against the appropriation for that item and credited to that special account.

##### 12  Appropriation of the Consolidated Revenue Fund

    * The Consolidated Revenue Fund is appropriated as necessary for the purposes of this Act, including the operation of this Act as affected by the _Public Governance, Performance and Accountability Act 2013_.

##### 13  Repeal of this Act

    * This Act is repealed at the start of 1 July 2018.

## Schedule 1--Services for which money is appropriated
