### An Act in relation to school education and reforms relating to school education, and for related purposes

#### Preamble

    * The Parliament of Australia acknowledges the following matters.

    * All students in all schools are entitled to an excellent education, allowing each student to reach his or her full potential so that he or she can succeed, achieve his or her aspirations, and contribute fully to his or her community, now and in the future.

    * The quality of a student's education should not be limited by where the student lives, the income of his or her family, the school he or she attends, or his or her personal circumstances.

    * The quality of education should not be limited by a school's location, particularly those schools in regional Australia.

    * It is essential that the Australian schooling system be of a high quality and be highly equitable in order for young Australians to become successful learners, confident and creative individuals, and active and informed citizens. A high quality and highly equitable Australian schooling system will also create a highly skilled, successful and inclusive workforce, strengthen the economy, and increase productivity, leading to greater prosperity for all.

    * If Australia is to be a prosperous nation with a high standard of living in the 21st century, the performance of Australia's schools, and school students, must continuously improve, particularly as school performance in countries around the world and in Australia's region is also improving.

    * It is also essential that Australian schooling provide school students with opportunities to engage with Australia's region. Through this engagement, Australia can maximise economic, cultural and social opportunities during the Asian century.

    * To address these matters, future arrangements will be based on the needs of Australian schools and school students, and on evidence of how to provide an excellent education for school students. These arrangements will build on the _Melbourne Declaration on Educational Goals for Young Australians_ (2008), which reaffirmed the importance of national collaboration and promoting high quality schooling for all Australian students, and successful reforms to date.

    * Schools will also need to adopt the opportunities offered by digital education and new evidencebased methods of teaching and learning.

    * Strong partnerships across the broader community are necessary to support all school students, including partnerships between teachers, parents, carers and families, notforprofit and community organisations, and employers.

    * As Australia's schools are diverse, the Australian Government will recognise the role of the Governments of the States and Territories, nongovernment education authorities, parents, carers and families, notforprofit and community organisations, other partners and schools in delivering school education, and work with them to support and lift the performance of schools and school students.

    * The Parliament of Australia enacts: 

### Part 1--Preliminary

#### Division 1--Preliminary

##### 1  Short title

    * This Act may be cited as the _Australian Education Act 2013_.

##### 2  Commencement

    * This Act commences on 1 January 2014.

##### 3  Objects of this Act

    * (1) The objects of this Act are the following:

     * (a) to ensure that the Australian schooling system provides a high quality and highly equitable education for all students by having regard to the following national targets:

      * (i) for Australia to be placed, by 2025, in the top 5 highest performing countries based on the performance of school students in reading, mathematics and science;

      * (ii) for the Australian schooling system to be considered a high quality and highly equitable schooling system by international standards by 2025;

      * (iii) lift the Year 12 (or equivalent) or Certificate II attainment rate to 90% by 2015;

      * (iv) lift the Year 12 (or equivalent) or Certificate III attainment rate to 90% by 2020;

      * (v) at least halve the gap between Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander students, and other students, in Year 12 or equivalent attainment rates by 2020 from the baseline in 2006;

      * (vi) halve the gap between Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander students, and other students, in reading, writing and numeracy by 2018 from the baseline in 2008;

     * (b) to acknowledge the matters referred to in the Preamble;

     * (c) to provide a needsbased funding model for schools applied consistently across all schools which includes:

      * (i) a base amount of funding for every student; and

      * (ii) additional loadings for students and schools who need extra support;

     * (d) to implement the National Plan for School Improvement.

    * (2) The Commonwealth will work with the governments of the States and Territories, and nongovernment education authorities, to implement the National Plan for School Improvement set out in the National Education Reform Agreement to meet the objects of this Act by addressing the reform directions set out in subsections (3) to (8).

        * Note: The governments of the States and Territories, and nongovernment education authorities, that agree to implement the National Plan for School Improvement set out in the National Education Reform Agreement will be provided with financial assistance in accordance with Part 3.

    * Quality teaching

    * (3) All teachers will have the skills, and support they require, to improve their performance over time and to deliver teaching of a high quality to all of their school students. The work of teachers will:

     * (a) reflect rigorous professional standards and best practice; and

     * (b) be based on evidence of successful teaching methods.

    * Quality learning

    * (4) Australian schooling will provide a high quality educational experience with an environment and curriculum that supports all school students to reach their full potential.

    * Empowered school leadership

    * (5) Leaders in schools will have the resources, the skills, and greater power, to make decisions and implement strategies at the local level to obtain the best outcomes for their schools and school students.

    * Transparency and accountability

    * (6) Support will be provided to schools to find ways to improve continuously by:

     * (a) analysing and applying data on the educational outcomes of school students (including outcomes relating to the academic performance, attendance, behaviour and wellbeing of school students); and

     * (b) making schools more accountable to the community in relation to their performance and the performance of their school students.

    * (7) Data collected on schools and school students will:

     * (a) be of a higher quality; and

     * (b) contain more detail; and

     * (c) be more consistent; and

     * (d) be more available to the public;

    * than data currently collected on schools and school students.

    * Meeting student need

    * (8) Australian schooling will place the highest priority on:

     * (a) identifying and addressing the needs of school students, including barriers to learning and wellbeing; and

     * (b) providing additional support to school students who require it.

        * Note: These reform directions are given effect to by this Act and relevant arrangements.

##### 4  Guide to this Act

    * This Act provides Commonwealth financial assistance for schools. The financial assistance is provided to States under section 96 of the Constitution, and to Territories under section 122 of the Constitution.

    * Each school has an approved authority, which is approved by the Minister. For a government school located in a State or Territory, the approved authority is the State or Territory. For a nongovernment school, the approved authority is a body corporate that is approved by the Minister for the school.

    * Financial assistance is provided directly to a State or Territory for its government schools. Financial assistance for a nongovernment school located in a State or Territory is provided to the State or Territory which must give it to the approved authority for the school.

    * The amount of recurrent funding that a school attracts for a year depends on whether the school is a participating school or a nonparticipating school. A participating school is a nongovernment school, or a government school of a participating State or Territory. (A participating State or Territory is a State or Territory that is a party to the National Education Reform Agreement and has a bilateral agreement with the Commonwealth in relation to implementing that Agreement.) An approved authority for more than one participating school must develop an implementation plan that explains how the authority intends to implement those reforms.

    * Financial assistance for participating schools is worked out using the formula in Division 2 of Part 3. The financial assistance consists of a base amount for all schools, plus loadings for schools with students with greater needs. The base amount and most of the loadings are worked out by reference to an amount per student called the SRS funding amount. (SRS is short for schooling resource standard.)

    * Not all participating schools will attract the amount worked out using the formula immediately. Some schools will move to that amount over a period of time. A special transitional rule also applies for special schools and special assistance schools.

    * Financial assistance for nonparticipating schools located in a State or Territory is worked out by reference to the amount the nonparticipating States and Territories received for 2013 through the national specific purpose payment for schools under the _Federal Financial Relations Act 2009_.

    * The Minister can determine other kinds of funding for any school under Part 5. The Minister can determine capital funding, which is ultimately provided to capital grants authorities and block grant authorities. The Minister can determine funding for schools in special circumstances or if the Minister is satisfied that prescribed circumstances apply in relation to schools. The Minister can also determine funding for nongovernment representative bodies for nongovernment schools. Nongovernment representative bodies are bodies that represent approved authorities for nongovernment schools. A block grant authority or nongovernment representative body is approved by the Minister.

    * The Minister may require an amount to be repaid, reduce an amount that would otherwise be payable, or delay making a payment, if an amount is owed to the Commonwealth under this Act (or other similar Acts) or there is a failure to comply with particular requirements.

##### 5  Binding the Crown

    * (1) This Act binds the Crown in each of its capacities.

    * (2) This Act does not make the Crown liable to be prosecuted for an offence.

### Part 3--Recurrent funding for participating schools

#### Division 1--Guide to this Part

##### 31  Guide to this Part

    * Financial assistance for participating schools is payable by the Commonwealth each year, based on a formula in Division 2 of this Part. The formula produces the Commonwealth share of a total amount of funding.

    * All participating schools are entitled to a base amount of funding for every student. Students and schools who need extra support will also attract additional loadings.

    * The base amount, and most of the loadings, are worked out by reference to an amount per student called the SRS funding amount. (SRS is short for schooling resource standard). There is a different SRS funding amount for primary and secondary students, which is indexed yearly.

    * The base amount for a school for a year reflects: 

        * (a) the number of students at the school for the year; and

        * (b) the SRS funding amount for the year for a student at the school; and

        * (c) the capacity of the school's community to contribute financially to the school.

    * The following loadings are also provided: 

        * (a) a loading for students with disability;

        * (b) a loading for Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander students;

        * (c) a loading for students with a low socioeconomic status;

        * (d) a loading for students who have low English proficiency;

        * (e) a loading for schools that are not in major cities;

        * (f) a loading for schools that are not large schools.

    * The loadings (except the size loading) are a percentage of the relevant SRS funding amount multiplied by the number of students at a school that qualify for that loading. The size loading provides an amount based on the total number of students at a school. Small schools, and very small schools in very remote areas with a certain number of students, are entitled to the maximum size loading while large schools are not entitled to any size loading. All other schools are entitled to a proportion of the maximum size loading.

    * Not all participating schools will attract the amount worked out using the formula immediately. Whether a particular school attracts funding using the formula depends on comparing an old per student amount for the school's approved authority and a new per student amount. Approved authorities whose old per student amount for 2014 is less than their new per student amount for 2014 will move to the amount worked out using the formula over a period of time. Approved authorities whose old per student amount for 2013, increased by 3%, is more than their new per student amount for 2014 will continue to receive the Commonwealth's share of the old per student amount, plus indexation, until the amount worked out using the formula catches up.

    * A special transitional rule applies for special schools and special assistance schools to ensure that the approved authority for those schools is paid at least the Commonwealth's share of the old per student amount for those students.

#### Division 2--The funding formula for participating schools

##### 32  The amount payable for a participating school

    * The amount of financial assistance that is payable under this Division to a State or Territory for a year for a participating school is worked out using the following formula: 

        * Note 1: During the transition period, the amount of financial assistance that is payable to a State or Territory may be worked out under Division 5.

        * Note 2: This amount may be rounded up or down (see section 56).

     * (a) the amount that would be the school's base amount for the year if the school were a primary school consisting only of those students at the school who are primary students;

     * (b) the amount that would be the school's base amount for the year if the school were a secondary school consisting only of those students at the school who are secondary students.

    * (3) To work out the **_base amount _**for a year for a school that is not covered by subsection 54(1) (capacity to contribute percentage) at which students receive distance education, add up the following amounts:

     * (a) the amount that would be the school's base amount under subsection (1) or (2) for the year excluding students receiving distance education at the school;

     * (b) the amount that would be the school's base amount under subsection (1) or (2) for the year if:

      * (i) the school were a school consisting only of those students receiving distance education at the school; and

      * (ii) the SRS funding amount for a student at the school were the percentage of that amount set out in subsection (4); and

      * (iii) the school's capacity to contribute percentage were 0%.
