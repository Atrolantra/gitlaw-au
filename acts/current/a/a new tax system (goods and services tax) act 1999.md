##### 910  Meaning of supply

    * (1) A **_supply_** is any form of supply whatsoever.

    * (2) Without limiting subsection (1), **_supply_** includes any of these:

    * (2A) It does not matter:

      * (a) whether the payment, act or forbearance was in compliance with an order of a court, or of a tribunal or other body that has the power to make orders; or

      * (b) whether the payment, act or forbearance was in compliance with a settlement relating to proceedings before a court, or before a tribunal or other body that has the power to make orders.

    * (2B) For the avoidance of doubt, the fact that the supplier is an entity of which the *recipient of the supply is a member, or that the supplier is an entity that only makes supplies to its members, does not prevent the payment, act or forbearance from being consideration.

##### 917  Certain payments and other things not consideration

    * (1) If a right or option to acquire a thing is granted, then:

      * (a) the **_consideration_** for the supply of the thing on the exercise of the right or option is limited to any additional consideration provided either for the supply or in connection with the exercise of the right or option; or

      * (b) if there is no such additional consideration--there is no consideration for the supply.

    * (2) Making a gift to a nonprofit body is not the provision of **_consideration_**.

    * (3) A payment is not the provision of **_consideration_** if:

      * (a) the payment is made by a *government related entity to another government related entity for making a supply; and

      * (b) the payment is:

        * (i) covered by an appropriation under an *Australian law; or

        * (ii) made under the National Health Reform Agreement agreed to by the Council of Australian Governments on 2 August 2011, as amended from time to time; or

        * (iii) made under another agreement entered into to implement the National Health Reform Agreement; and

      * (c) the payment is calculated on the basis that the sum of:

        * (i) the payment (including the amounts of any other such payments) relating to the supply; and

        * (ii) anything (including any payment for any act or forbearance) that the other government related entity receives from another entity in connection with, or in response to, or for the inducement of, the supply, or for any other related supply;

      * does not exceed the supplier's anticipated or actual costs of making those supplies.

    * (4) A payment is not the provision of **_consideration_** if the payment is made by a *government related entity to another government related entity and the payment is of a kind specified in regulations made for the purposes of this subsection.

    * (5) This section applies despite section 915.

##### 920  Enterprises

    * (1) An **_enterprise_** is an activity, or series of activities, done:

      * (a) in the form of a *business; or

      * (b) in the form of an adventure or concern in the nature of trade; or

      * (c) on a regular or continuous basis, in the form of a lease, licence or other grant of an interest in property; or

      * (d) by the trustee of a fund that is covered by, or by an authority or institution that is covered by, Subdivision 30B of the *ITAA 1997 and to which deductible gifts can be made; or

    * (2) However, **_enterprise_** does not include an activity, or series of activities, done:

      * (a) by a person as an employee or in connection with earning *withholding payments covered by subsection (4) (unless the activity or series is done in supplying services as the holder of an office that the person has accepted in the course of or in connection with an activity or series of activities of a kind mentioned in subsection (1)); or

            * Note: Acts done as mentioned in paragraph (a) will still form part of the activities of the enterprise to which the person provides work or services.

      * (b) as a private recreational pursuit or hobby; or

      * (c) by an individual (other than a trustee of a charitable fund, or of a fund covered by item 2 of the table in section 3015 of the ITAA 1997 or of a fund that would be covered by that item if it had an ABN), or a *partnership (all or most of the members of which are individuals), without a reasonable expectation of profit or gain; or

    * (3) For the avoidance of doubt, the fact that activities of an entity are limited to making supplies to members of the entity does not prevent those activities:

      * (a) being in the form of a *business within the meaning of paragraph (1)(a); or

      * (b) being in the form of an adventure or concern in the nature of trade within the meaning of paragraph (1)(b).

    * (4) This subsection covers a *withholding payment covered by any of the provisions in Schedule 1 to the _Taxation Administration Act 1953_ listed in the table.

      * (c) all of the following apply:

        * (i) neither paragraph (a) nor (b) applies in respect of the thing;

        * (ii) the thing is a right or option to acquire another thing;

        * (iii) the supply of the other thing would be connected with the indirect tax zone.

          * Example: A holiday package for a trip to Queensland that is supplied by a travel operator in Japan will be connected with the indirect tax zone under paragraph (5)(c).

    * When enterprises are carried on in the indirect tax zone

    * Supplies that would be both GSTfree and input taxed 

    * (3) To the extent that a supply would, apart from this subsection, be both *GSTfree and *input taxed:

      * (b) the supply is input taxed and not GSTfree, if that provision requires the supplier to have so chosen. 

          * Note: Subdivisions 40E (School tuckshops and canteens) and 40F (Fundraising events conducted by charities etc.) require such a choice.) 

    * Supply of things used solely in connection with making supplies that are input taxed but not financial supplies

    * (4) A supply is taken to be a supply that is *input taxed if it is a supply of anything (other than *new residential premises) that you have used _solely_ in connection with your supplies that are input taxed but are not *financial supplies.

##### 939  Special rules relating to taxable supplies

    * Chapter 4 contains special rules relating to taxable supplies, as follows:

##### 940  Liability for GST on taxable supplies

    * You must pay the GST payable on any *taxable supply that you make.

##### 969  Special rules relating to liability for GST on taxable supplies

    * Chapter 4 contains special rules relating to liability for GST on taxable supplies, as follows:

##### Subdivision 9C--How much GST is payable on taxable supplies?

##### 970  The amount of GST on taxable supplies

    * The amount of GST on a *taxable supply i0% of the *value of the taxable supply.

##### 975  The value of taxable supplies

    * (1) The **_value _**of a *taxable supply is as follows:

    * where: 

    * **_price_** is the sum of:

      * (a) so far as the *consideration for the supply is consideration expressed as an amount of *money--the amount (without any discount for the amount of GST (if any) payable on the supply); and

      * (b) so far as the consideration is not consideration expressed as an amount of money--the *GST inclusive market value of that consideration.

          * Example: You make a taxable supply by selling a car for $22,000 in the course of carrying on an enterprise.

          * The value of the supply is: 

          * The GST on the supply is therefore $2,000 (i.e. 10% of $20,000).

    * (2) However, if the taxable supply is of a *luxury car, the **_value_** of the taxable supply is as follows:

    * where: 

    * **_luxury car tax value_** has the meaning given by section 520 of the _A New Tax System (Luxury Car Tax) Act 1999_.

    * (3) In working out under subsection (1) the value of a *taxable supply made in a *tax period, being a supply that is a *fringe benefit, the price is taken to be the sum of:

      * (a) to the extent that, apart from this subsection, paragraph(a) of the definition of **_price_** in subsection (1) would be applicable:

        * (i) if the fringe benefit is a car fringe benefit--so much of the amount that would be worked out under that paragraph as represented the *recipient's payment made in that period; or

        * (ii) if the fringe benefit is a benefit other than a car fringe benefit--so much of the amount that would be worked out under that paragraph as represented the *recipients contribution made in that period; and

      * (b) to the extent that, apart from this subsection, paragraph(b) of the definition of **_price_** in subsection (1) would be applicable:

        * (i) if the fringe benefit is a car fringe benefit--so much of the amount that would be worked out under that paragraph as represented the recipient's payment made in that period; or

        * (ii) if the fringe benefit is a benefit other than a car fringe benefit--so much of the amount that would be worked out under that paragraph as represented the recipients contribution made in that period.

##### 980  The value of taxable supplies that are partly GSTfree or input taxed

    * (1) If a supply (the **_actual supply_**) is:

      * (a) partly a *taxable supply; and

      * (b) partly a supply that is *GSTfree or *input taxed;

    * the **_value_** of the part of the actual supply that is a taxable supply is the proportion of the value of the actual supply that the taxable supply represents.

    * (2) The value of the actual supply, for the purposes of subsection (1), is as follows:

    * where: 

    * **_taxable proportion_** is the proportion of the value of the actual supply that represents the value of the *taxable supply (expressed as a number between 0 and 1).

##### 985  Value of taxable supplies to be expressed in Australian currency

    * (1) For the purposes of this Act, the *value of a *taxable supply is to be expressed in Australian currency.

    * (2) In working out the *value of a *taxable supply, any amount of the *consideration for the supply that is expressed in a currency other than Australian currency is to be treated as if it were an amount of Australian currency worked out in the manner determined by the Commissioner.

##### 990  Rounding of amounts of GST 

    * One taxable supply recorded on an invoice 

    * (1) If the amount of GST on a *taxable supply that is the only taxable supply recorded on a particular *invoice would, apart from this section, be an amount that includes a fraction of a cent, the amount of GST is rounded to the nearest cent (rounding 0.5 cents upwards). 

    * Several taxable supplies recorded on an invoice 

    * (2) If 2 or more *taxable supplies are recorded on the same *invoice, the total amount of GST on the supplies is: 

      * (a) what would be the amount of GST if it were worked out by: 

        * (i) working out the GST on each of the supplies (without rounding the amounts to the nearest cent); and 

        * (ii) adding the amounts together and, if the total is an amount that includes a fraction of a cent, rounding it to the nearest cent (rounding 0.5 cents upwards); or 

      * (b) the amount worked out using the following method statement: 

    * _Method statement _

        * _Step 1.	Work out, for each *taxable supply, what would, apart from this section, be the amount of GST on the supply. 

        * Step 2.	If the amount for the supply has more decimal places than the number of decimal places allowed by the accounting system used to work out the amount, round the amount (up or down as appropriate) to that number of decimal places. 

          * Note: Subsection (4) gives further details of this rounding.

        * Step 3.	Work out the sum of the amounts worked out under step 1 and (if applicable) step 2 for each supply. 

        * Step 4.	If the sum under step 3 includes a fraction of a cent, round the sum to the nearest cent (rounding 0.5 cents upwards). 

    * (3) Whether to use paragraph (2)(a) or paragraph (2)(b) to work out the total amount of GST on the supplies is a matter of choice for: 

      * (a) the supplier if the amount is being worked out to ascertain the supplier's liability for GST; or 

      * (b) the *recipient of the supplies if the amount is being worked out to ascertain the recipient's entitlement to input tax credits. 

    * (4) In applying step 2 of the method statement in subsection (2), if: 

      * (a) the number of decimal places in the amount for the supply exceeds by one decimal place the number of decimal places allowed by the accounting system used to work out the amount; and 

      * (b) the last digit of the amount (before rounding) is 5; 

    * the amount is rounded upwards to that number of decimal places. 

    * Taxable supplies divided into items 

    * (5) If one or more *taxable supplies recorded on the same *invoice are divided into 2 or more items: 

      * (a) subsection (1) does not apply; and 

      * (b) subsection (2) applies as if each such item represented a separate taxable supply. 

    * Taxable supplies recorded on documents other than invoices 

    * (6) If one or more *taxable supplies, none of which are recorded on an *invoice, are recorded on a document that is not an invoice, this section applies as if the document were an invoice. 

##### 999  Special rules relating to the amount of GST on taxable supplies

    * Chapter 4 contains special rules relating to the amount of GST on taxable supplies, as follows:

          * Note: There are other laws that may affect the amount of GST on taxable supplies. For example, see subsection 35760(3) in Schedule 1 to the _Taxation Administration Act 1953_ (about the effect of rulings made under Part 55 in that Schedule).

          * Note: The basic rule for working out the GST payable on the supply is in Subdivision 9C. However, the GST payable may be affected by other provisions in:

            * (a) this Act (for a list of provisions, see section 999); and

            * (b) other GST laws (for example, see subsection 35760(3) in Schedule 1 to the _Taxation Administration Act 1953_ (about the effect of rulings made under Part 55 in that Schedule)).

    * If an importation (the **_actual importation_**) is:

      * (a) partly a *taxable importation; and

      *  (b) partly a *nontaxable importation;

      * (b) the importation is a *taxable importation; and

      * (c) you are *registered, or *required to be registered.

##### 1510  Meaning of creditable purpose

    * (1) You import goods for a **_creditable purpose_** to the extent that you import the goods in *carrying on your *enterprise.

    * (2) However, you do not import the goods for a creditable purpose to the extent that:

      * (a) the importation relates to making supplies that would be *input taxed; or

      * (b) the importation is of a private or domestic nature.

    * (3) An importation is not treated, for the purposes of paragraph (2)(a), as relating to making supplies that would be *input taxed to the extent that the supply is made through an *enterprise, or a part of an enterprise, that you *carry on outside the indirect tax zone.

    * (4) An importation is not treated, for the purposes of paragraph (2)(a), as relating to making supplies that would be *input taxed if:

      * (a) the only reason it would (apart from this subsection) be so treated is because it relates to making *financial supplies; and

      * (b) you do not *exceed the financial acquisitions threshold. 

    * (5) An importation is not treated, for the purposes of paragraph (2)(a), as relating to making supplies that would be *input taxed to the extent that: 

      * (a) the importation relates to making a *financial supply consisting of a borrowing; and 

      * (b) the borrowing relates to you making supplies that are not input taxed. 

##### 1515  Who is entitled to input tax credits for creditable importations?

    * You are entitled to the input tax credit for any *creditable importation that you make.

##### 1520  How much are the input tax credits for creditable importations?

    * The amount of input tax credit for a *creditable importation is an amount equal to the GST payable on the importation. However, the amount of the input tax credit is reduced if the importation is only *partly creditable.

          * Note: The basic rule for working out the GST payable on the importation is in section 1320. However, the GST payable may be affected by other provisions in:

            * (a) this Act (for a list of provisions, see section 1399); and

            * (b) other GST laws (for example, see subsection 35760(3) in Schedule 1 to the _Taxation Administration Act 1953_ (about the effect of rulings made under Part 55 in that Schedule)).

##### 1525  Importations that are partly creditable

    * (1) An importation that you make is **_partly creditable_** if it is a *creditable importation that you make only partly for a *creditable purpose.

    * (3) The amount of the input tax credit on an importation that you make that is *partly creditable is as follows:

    * where: 

    * **_extent of creditable purpose_** is the extent to which the importation is for a *creditable purpose, expressed as a percentage of the total purpose of the importation.

    * **_full input tax credit_** is what would have been the amount of the input tax credit for the importation if it had been made solely for a creditable purpose.

    * (4) The Commissioner may determine, in writing, one or more ways in which to work out, for the purpose of subsection (3), the extent to which an importation is for a *creditable purpose.

##### 1599  Special rules relating to creditable importations

    * Chapter 4 contains special rules relating to creditable importations, as follows:

### Part 24--Net amounts and adjustments

#### Division 17--Net amounts and adjustments

##### 171  What this Division is about

    * A net amount is worked out for each tax period that applies to you.

    * Adjustments can be made to the net amount. Increasing adjustments increase your net amount, and decreasing adjustments decrease your net amount.

          * Note: GST on taxable importations is not included in the net amount. It is dealt with separately under section 3315.

##### 175  Net amounts

    * (1) The **_net amount_** for a tax period applying to you is worked out using the following formula:

    * where: 

    * **_GST_** is the sum of all of the GST for which you are liable on the *taxable supplies that are attributable to the tax period.

    * **_input tax credits_** is the sum of all of the input tax credits to which you are entitled for the *creditable acquisitions and *creditable importations that are attributable to the tax period.

          * Note 1: For the basic rules on what is attributable to a particular period, see Division 29.

          * Note 2: For further rules if you have excess GST for the period, see Division 142.

    * (2) However, the *net amount for the tax period:

      * (a) may be increased or decreased if you have any *adjustments for the tax period; and

      * (b) may be increased or decreased under Subdivision 21A of the *Wine Tax Act; and

      * (c) may be increased or decreased under Subdivision 13A of the _A New Tax System (Luxury Car Tax) Act 1999_.

          * Note 1: Under Subdivision 21A of the Wine Tax Act, amounts of wine tax increase the net amount, and amounts of wine tax credits reduce the net amount.

          * Note 2: Under Subdivision 13A of the _A New Tax System (Luxury Car Tax) Act 1999_, amounts of luxury car tax increase the net amount, and luxury car tax adjustments alter the net amount.

##### 1710  Adjustments

    * If you have any *adjustments that are attributable to a tax period applying to you, alter your *net amount for the period as follows:

      * (a) add to the amount worked out under subsection 175(1) for the period the sum of all the *increasing adjustments (if any) that are attributable to the period;

      * (b) subtract from that amount the sum of all the *decreasing adjustments (if any) that are attributable to the period.

          * For the basic rules on what adjustments are attributable to a particular period, see Division 29.

##### 1720  Determinations relating to how to work out net amounts

    * (1) The Commissioner may make a determination that, in the circumstances specified in the determination, a *net amount for a tax period may be worked out to take account of other matters in the way specified in the determination.

    * (2) The matters must relate to correction of errors:

      * (a) that were made in working out *net amounts to which subsection (2A) applies; and

      * (b) that do not relate to amounts:

        * (i) that have ceased to be payable by you because of section 10550 in Schedule 1 to the _Taxation Administration Act 1953_; or

        * (ii) to which, because of section 10555 in that Schedule, you are not entitled.

          * Note: Paragraph (2)(b) will be repealed on 1 January 2017: see Part 2 of Schedule 1 to the _Indirect Tax Laws Amendment (Assessment) Act 2012_.

    * (2A) This subsection applies to a *net amount for a tax period (the **_earlier tax period_**) if:

      * (a) the earlier tax period precedes the tax period mentioned in subsection (1); and

      * (b) if the earlier tax period started on or after 1 July 2012--the tax period mentioned in subsection (1) starts during the *period of review for the *assessment of the *net amount.

    * (3) If those circumstances apply in relation to a tax period applying to you, you may work out your *net amount for the tax period in that way.

##### 1799  Special rules relating to net amounts or adjustments

    * Chapter 4 contains special rules relating to net amounts or adjustments, as follows:

#### Division 19--Adjustment events

##### Table of Subdivisions

      * 19A	Adjustment events

      * 19B	Adjustments for supplies

      * 19C	Adjustments for acquisitions

##### 191  What this Division is about

    * Adjustments can arise because of adjustment events. They are events such as a cancellation of a supply or acquisition, or a change in the consideration for a supply or acquisition (for example, because of a volume discount).

          * Note: Importations do not give rise to adjustment events.

##### 195  Explanation of the effect of adjustment events

    * The following diagram shows how an *adjustment event for a supply or acquisition can give rise to an *increasing adjustment or a *decreasing adjustment.

          * Note: This section is an explanatory section.

##### Subdivision 19A--Adjustment events

##### 1910  Adjustment events

    * (1) An **_adjustment event_** is any event which has the effect of:

      * (a) cancelling a supply or acquisition; or

      * (b) changing the *consideration for a supply or acquisition; or

      * (c) causing a supply or acquisition to become, or stop being, a *taxable supply or *creditable acquisition.

          * Example: If goods that are supplied for export are not exported within the time provided in section 38185, the supply is likely to become a taxable supply after originally being a supply that was GSTfree.

    * (2) Without limiting subsection (1), these are *adjustment events:

      * (a) the return to a supplier of a thing, or part of a thing, supplied (whether or not the return involves a change of ownership of the thing);

      * (b) a change to the previously agreed *consideration for a supply or acquisition, whether due to the offer of a discount or otherwise;

      * (c) a change in the extent to which an entity that makes an acquisition provides, or is liable to provide, consideration for the acquisition (unless the entity *accounts on a cash basis).

    * (3) An *adjustment event:

      * (a) can arise in relation to a supply even if it is not a *taxable supply; and

      * (b) can arise in relation to an acquisition even if it is not a *creditable acquisition.

    * (4) However, the return of a thing supplied, or part of a thing supplied, to its supplier is not an *adjustment event if the return is for the purpose of repair or maintenance.

##### Subdivision 19B--Adjustments for supplies

##### 1940  Where adjustments for supplies arise

    * You have an **_adjustment_** for a supply for which you are liable to pay GST (or would be liable to pay GST if it were a *taxable supply) if:

      * (a) in relation to the supply, one or more *adjustment events occur during a tax period; and

      * (b) GST on the supply was attributable to an earlier tax period (or, if the supply was not a taxable supply, would have been attributable to an earlier tax period had the supply been a taxable supply); and

      * (c) as a result of those adjustment events, the *previously attributed GST amount for the supply (if any) no longer correctly reflects the amount of GST (if any) on the supply (the **_corrected GST amount_**), taking into account any change of circumstances that has given rise to an adjustment for the supply under this Subdivision or Division 21 or 134.

##### 1945  Previously attributed GST amounts

    * The **_previously attributed GST amount_** for a supply is:

      * (a) the amount of any GST that was attributable to a tax period in respect of the supply; plus

      * (b) the sum of any *increasing adjustments, under this Subdivision or Division 21, that were previously attributable to a tax period in respect of the supply; minus

      * (c) the sum of any *decreasing adjustments, under this Subdivision or Division 21 or 134, that were previously attributable to a tax period in respect of the supply.

##### 1950  Increasing adjustments for supplies

    * If the *corrected GST amount is _greater_ than the *previously attributed GST amount, you have an **_increasing adjustment_** equal to the difference between the corrected GST amount and the previously attributed GST amount.

##### 1955  Decreasing adjustments for supplies

    * If the *corrected GST amount is _less_ than the *previously attributed GST amount, you have a **_decreasing adjustment_** equal to the difference between the previously attributed GST amount and the corrected GST amount.

##### Subdivision 19C--Adjustments for acquisitions

##### 1970  Where adjustments for acquisitions arise

    * (1) You have an **_adjustment_** for an acquisition for which you are entitled to an input tax credit (or would be entitled to an input tax credit if the acquisition were a *creditable acquisition) if:

      * (a) in relation to the acquisition, one or more *adjustment events occur during a tax period; and

      * (b) an input tax credit on the acquisition was attributable to an earlier tax period (or, if the acquisition was not a creditable acquisition, would have been attributable to an earlier tax period had the acquisition been a creditable acquisition); and

      * (c) as a result of those adjustment events, the *previously attributed input tax credit amount for the acquisition (if any) no longer correctly reflects the amount of the input tax credit (if any) on the acquisition (the **_corrected input tax credit amount_**).

    * (2) In working out the *corrected input tax credit amount for the acquisition:

      * (a) take into account any change of circumstances that has given rise to an adjustment for the acquisition under this Subdivision or Division 21, 129, 133 or 134; and

      * (b) if an adjustment relating to the acquisition under Division 131 was attributable to an earlier tax period:

        * (i) do not take into account that adjustment; and

        * (ii) treat the acquisition as one in relation to which Division 131 had not applied.

##### 1975  Previously attributed input tax credit amounts

    * The **_previously attributed input tax credit amount _**for an acquisition is:

      * (a) the amount of any input tax credit that was attributable to a tax period in respect of the acquisition; minus

      * (b) the sum of any *increasing adjustments, under this Subdivision or Division 21, 129, 131 or 134, that were previously attributable to a tax period in respect of the acquisition; plus

      * (c) the sum of any *decreasing adjustments, under this Subdivision or Division 21, 129 or 133, that were previously attributable to a tax period in respect of the acquisition.

##### 1980  Increasing adjustments for acquisitions

    * If the *previously attributed input tax credit amount is _greater_ than the *corrected input tax credit amount, you have an **_increasing adjustment_** equal to the difference between the previously attributed input tax credit amount and the corrected input tax credit amount.

##### 1985  Decreasing adjustments for acquisitions

    * If the *previously attributed input tax credit amount is _less_ than the *corrected input tax credit amount, you have a **_decreasing adjustment_** equal to the difference between the corrected input tax credit amount and the previously attributed input tax credit amount.

##### 1999  Special rules relating to adjustment events

    * Chapter 4 contains special rules relating to *adjustment events in particular cases, as follows:

#### Division 21--Bad debts

##### 211  What this Division is about

    * If debts are written off as bad or are outstanding after 12 months, adjustments (for the purpose of working out net amounts) are made. They can arise both for amounts written off or outstanding and for recovery of amounts previously written off or outstanding.

          * Note: This Division does not apply to supplies and acquisitions that you account for on a cash basis (except in the limited circumstances referred to in Division 159).

##### 215  Writing off bad debts (taxable supplies)

    * (1) You have a **_decreasing adjustment_** if:

      * (a) you made a *taxable supply; and

      * (b) the whole or part of the *consideration for the supply has not been received; and

      * (c) you write off as bad the whole or a part of the debt, or the whole or a part of the debt has been *overdue for 12 months or more.

    * The amount of the decreasing adjustment i/11 of the amount written off, or 1/11 of the amount that has been overdue for 12 months or more, as the case requires.

    * (2) However, you cannot have an *adjustment under this section if you *account on a cash basis.

##### 2110  Recovering amounts previously written off (taxable supplies)

      * (a) you made a *taxable supply in relation to which you had a *decreasing adjustment under section 215 for a debt; and

      * (b) you recover the whole or a part of the amount written off, or the whole or a part of the amount that has been *overdue for 12 months or more, as the case requires.

    * The amount of the increasing adjustment i/11 of the amount recovered.

##### 2115  Bad debts written off (creditable acquisitions)

    * (1) You have an **_increasing adjustment_** if:

      * (a) you made a *creditable acquisition for *consideration; and

      * (b) the whole or part of the consideration is *overdue, but you have not provided the consideration overdue; and

      * (c) the supplier of the thing you acquired writes off as bad the whole or a part of the debt, or the whole or a part of the debt has been overdue for 12 months or more.

    * The amount of the increasing adjustment i/11 of the amount written off, or 1/11 of the amount that has been overdue for 12 months or more, as the case requires.

    * (2) However, you cannot have an *adjustment under this section if you *account on a cash basis.

##### 2120  Recovering amounts previously written off (creditable acquisitions)

    * You have a **_decreasing adjustment_** if:

      * (a) you made a *creditable acquisition in relation to which you had an *increasing adjustment under section 2115 for a debt; and

      * (b) you pay to the supplier of the thing you acquired the whole or a part of the amount written off, or the whole or a part of the amount that has been *overdue for 12 months or more, as the case requires.

    * The amount of the decreasing adjustment i/11 of the amount recovered.

##### 2799  Special rules relating to tax periods

    * Chapter 4 contains special rules relating to tax periods, as follows:

#### Division 29--What is attributable to tax periods

##### Table of Subdivisions

      * 29A	The attribution rules

      * 29B	Accounting on a cash basis

      * 29C	Tax invoices and adjustment notes

##### 291  What this Division is about

    * This Division tells you the tax periods to which your taxable supplies, creditable acquisitions, creditable importations and adjustments are attributable. You need to know this to work out your net amounts under Part 24.

          * Note: This Division does not deal with your taxable importations, because they are not attributed to tax periods. See section 3315 for payment of assessed GST on taxable importations.

##### Subdivision 29A--The attribution rules

##### 295  Attributing the GST on your taxable supplies

    * (1) The GST payable by you on a *taxable supply is attributable to:

      * (a) the tax period in which any of the *consideration is received for the supply; or

      * (b) if, before any of the consideration is received, an *invoice is issued relating to the supply--the tax period in which the invoice is issued.

    * (2) However, if you *account on a cash basis, then:

      * (a) if, in a tax period, _all_ of the *consideration is received for a *taxable supply--GST on the supply is attributable to that tax period; or

      * (b) if, in a tax period, _part_ of the consideration is received--GST on the supply is attributable to that tax period, but only to the extent that the consideration is received in that tax period; or

      * (c) if, in a tax period, _none_ of the consideration is received--none of the GST on the supply is attributable to that tax period.

##### 2910  Attributing the input tax credits for your creditable acquisitions

    * (1) The input tax credit to which you are entitled for a *creditable acquisition is attributable to:

      * (a) the tax period in which you provide any of the *consideration for the acquisition; or

      * (b) if, before you provide any of the consideration, an *invoice is issued relating to the acquisition--the tax period in which the invoice is issued.

    * (2) However, if you *account on a cash basis, then:

      * (a) if, in a tax period, you provide _all_ of the *consideration for a *creditable acquisition--the input tax credit for the acquisition is attributable to that tax period; or

      * (b) if, in a tax period, you provide _part_ of the consideration--the input tax credit for the acquisition is attributable to that tax period, but only to the extent that you provided the consideration in that tax period; or

      * (c) if, in a tax period, _none_ of the consideration is provided--none of the input tax credit for the acquisition is attributable to that tax period.

    * (3) If you do not hold a *tax invoice for a *creditable acquisition when you give to the Commissioner a *GST return for the tax period to which the input tax credit (or any part of the input tax credit) on the acquisition would otherwise be attributable:

      * (a) the input tax credit (including any part of the input tax credit) is not attributable to that tax period; and

      * (b) the input tax credit (or part) is attributable to the first tax period for which you give to the Commissioner a GST return at a time when you hold that tax invoice.

    * However, this subsection does not apply in circumstances of a kind determined in writing by the Commissioner to be circumstances in which the requirement for a tax invoice does not apply.

          * For the giving of GST returns to the Commissioner, see Division 31.

    * (4) If the *GST return for a tax period does not take into account an input tax credit attributable to that tax period:

      * (a) the input tax credit is not attributable to that tax period; and

      * (b) the input tax credit is attributable to the first tax period for which you give the Commissioner a GST return that does take it into account.

          * Note: Section 935 or 9315 may provide a time limit on your entitlement to an input tax credit.

##### 2915  Attributing the input tax credits for your creditable importations

    * (1) The input tax credit to which you are entitled for a *creditable importation is attributable to the tax period in which you pay the *assessed GST on the importation.

    * (2) However, if paragraph 3315(1)(b) applies to payment of the *assessed GST on the importation, the input tax credit is attributable to the tax period in which the liability for the GST arose.

##### 2920  Attributing your adjustments

    * (1) An *adjustment that you have is attributable to the tax period in which you become aware of the adjustment.

    * (2) However, if you *account on a cash basis, and the *adjustment arises from an *adjustment event as a result of which you are liable to provide *consideration, then:

      * (a) if, in a tax period, _all _of the consideration is provided--the *adjustment is attributable to that tax period; or

      * (b) if, in a tax period, _part _of the consideration is provided--the adjustment is attributable to that tax period, but only to the extent that the consideration is provided in that tax period; or

      * (c) if, in a tax period, _none_ of the consideration is provided--none of the adjustment is attributable to that tax period.

    * (3) If:

      * (a) you have a *decreasing adjustment arising from an *adjustment event; and

      * (b) you do not hold an *adjustment note for the adjustment when you give to the Commissioner a *GST return for the tax period to which the adjustment (or any part of the adjustment) would otherwise be attributable;

    * then: 

      * (c) the adjustment (including any part of the adjustment) is not attributable to that tax period; and

      * (d) the adjustment (or part) is attributable to the first tax period for which you give to the Commissioner a GST return at a time when you hold that adjustment note.

    * However, this subsection does not apply in circumstances of a kind determined in writing by the Commissioner to be circumstances in which the requirement for an adjustment note does not apply.

          * For the giving of GST returns to the Commissioner, see Division 31.

##### 2925  Commissioner may determine particular attribution rules

    * (1) The Commissioner may, in writing, determine the tax periods to which:

      * (a) GST on *taxable supplies of a specified kind; or

      * (b) input tax credits for *creditable acquisitions of a specified kind; or

      * (c) input tax credits for *creditable importations of a specified kind; or

      * (d) *adjustments of a specified kind;

    * are attributable.

    * (2) However, the Commissioner must not make a determination under this section unless satisfied that it is necessary to prevent the provisions of this Division and Chapter 4 applying in a way that is inappropriate in circumstances involving:

      * (a) a supply or acquisition in which possession of goods passes, but title in the goods will, or may, pass at some time in the future; or

      * (b) a supply or acquisition for which payment is made or an *invoice is issued, but use, enjoyment or passing of title will, or may, occur at some time in the future; or

      * (c) a supply or acquisition occurring, but still being subject to a statutory cooling off period under an *Australian law; or

      * (d) a supply or acquisition occurring before the supplier or *recipient knows it has occurred; or

      * (e) a supply or acquisition occurring before the supplier or recipient knows the total *consideration; or

      * (f) a supply or acquisition made under a contract that is subject to preconditions; or

      * (g) a supply or acquisition made under a contract that provides for retention of some or all of the consideration until certain conditions are met; or 

      * (h) a supply or acquisition for which the GST treatment will be unknown until a later supply is made.

    * (3) Determinations under subsection (1) override the provisions of this Division (except this section) and Chapter 4, but only to the extent of any inconsistency.

##### 3399  Special rules relating to payments of GST

#### Division 35--Refunds

##### 351  What this Division is about

    * (1) If the *assessed net amount for a tax period is less than zero, the Commissioner must, on behalf of the Commonwealth, pay that amount (expressed as a positive amount) to you.

          * Note 1: See Division 3A of Part IIB of the _Taxation Administration Act 1953_ for the rules about how the Commissioner must pay you. Division 3 of Part IIB allows the Commissioner to apply the amount owing as a credit against tax debts that you owe to the Commonwealth.

          * Note 2: Interest is payable under the _Taxation (Interest on Overpayments and Early Payments) Act 1983_ if the Commissioner is late in refunding the amount.

      * (b) your *assessed net amount before the amendment was less than zero; and

      * (c) the amount that, because of the assessment, was:

        * (i) paid; or

        * (ii) applied under the _Taxation Administration Act 1953_;

      * exceeded the amount (including a nil amount) that would have been payable or applicable had your assessed net amount always been the later assessed net amount;

    * the amount of the excess is to be treated as if: 

      * (d) the excess were an assessed net amount for the tax period; and

      * (e) that assessed net amount were an amount greater than zero and equal to the amount of the excess; and

      * (f) despite Division 33, that assessed net amount became payable, and due for payment, by you at the time when the amount was paid or applied.

          * Note: Treating the excess as if it were an assessed net amount has the effect of applying the collection and recovery rules in Part 310 in Schedule 1 to the _Taxation Administration Act 1953_, such as a liability to pay the general interest charge under section 10580 in that Schedule.

##### 3510  When entitlement arises

    * Your entitlement to be paid an amount under section 355 arises when the Commissioner gives you notice of the *assessment of your *net amount for the tax period.

      * (c) the goods are returned to the indirect tax zone on or after 1 July 2000, without having been subject to any treatment, industrial processing, repair, renovation, alteration or any other process since their export; and

      * (d) the importer was not entitled to, and did not claim, a payment under Division 168 (about the tourist refund scheme) related to the export of the goods; and

      * (e) the ownership of the goods when they are returned to the indirect tax zone is the same as their ownership on 1 July 2000.

          * Note: An importation covered by this section may also be dutyfree under item 17 of Schedule 4 to the _Customs Tariff Act 1995_.

## Chapter 4--The special rules

#### Division 45--Introduction

##### 451  What this Chapter is about

    * This Chapter sets out the special rules for the GST. The special rules apply only in particular circumstances, and are generally quite limited in their scope.

    * The special rules modify the application of the basic rules for the GST in Chapter 2.

          * Note 1: The special rules that modify each group of basic rules in Chapter 2 are specifically identified in tables located at the end of the Divisions and Subdivisions in Chapter 2. In addition, a checklist of special rules is set out in Part 28.

          * Note 2: This section is an explanatory section.

##### 455  The effect of special rules

    * The provisions of this Chapter override the provisions of Chapter 2 (except section 2925), but only to the extent of any inconsistency.

### Part 41--Special rules mainly about particular ways entities are organised

  * Note: The special rules in this Part mainly modify the operation of Part 22 so far as that Part deals with liability for GST and entitlement to input tax credits, but the special rules also affect other aspects of Part 22 and the other Parts of Chapter 2.

#### Division 48--GST groups

##### Table of Subdivisions

      * 48A	Formation and membership of GST groups

      * 48B	Consequences of GST groups

      * 48C	Administrative matters

      * 48D	Ceasing to be a member of a GST group

##### 481  What this Division is about

    * Companies within a 90% owned group, and in some cases other entities (such as nonprofit bodies), can form a GST group. One member of the group then deals with all the GST liabilities and entitlements (except for GST on most taxable importations) of the group, and (in most cases) intragroup transactions are excluded from the GST.

          * Note: Provisions for members of GST groups apply for the wine equalisation tax (see Subdivision 21B of the Wine Tax Act) and the luxury car tax (see Subdivision 16A of the _A New Tax System (Luxury Car Tax) Act 1999_).

##### Subdivision 48A--Formation and membership of GST groups

##### 485  Formation of GST groups

    * (1) Two or more entities may form a *GST group if:

      * (a) each of the entities *satisfies the membership requirements of the group; and

      * (b) each of the entities agrees in writing to the formation of the group; and

      * (c) one of those entities notifies the Commissioner, in the *approved form, of the formation of the group; and

      * (d) that entity is nominated, in that notice, to be the *representative member of the group; and

      * (e) that entity is an *Australian resident.

    * A group of entities that is so formed is a **_GST group_**.

    * (2) If 2 or more entities would *satisfy the membership requirements for the *GST group, the group need not include all those entities.

    * (3) The formation of the *GST group takes effect from the start of the day specified in the notice under paragraph (1)(c) (whether that day is before, on or after the day on which the entities decided to form the group).

    * (4) However, if the notice was given to the Commissioner after the day by which the entity nominated to be the *representative member of the group is required to give to the Commissioner a *GST return for the tax period in which the day specified in the notice occurs, the formation of the *GST group takes effect from the start of:

      * (a) the day specified in the notice, if that day is approved by the Commissioner under section 4871; and

      * (b) if paragraph (a) does not apply--such other day as the Commissioner approves under that section.

##### 487  Membership of GST groups

    * (1) A **_member_** of a *GST group is an entity that:

      * (a) formed the group under section 485, or was added to the group under section 4870; and

      * (b) *satisfies the membership requirements of the group.

    * (2) However, the entity is not a member of the *GST group if the entity has, since the last time the entity became such a member:

      * (a) left, or been removed from, the group under section 4870; or

      * (b) ceased to *satisfy the membership requirements of the group.

    * (3) The *representative member of a *GST group must notify the Commissioner, in the *approved form, if a *member of the group no longer *satisfies the membership requirements for the GST group.

    * (4) The notice must be given within 21 days after the *member no longer *satisfies the membership requirements for the *GST group.

          * Note: Section 28675 in Schedule 1 to the _Taxation Administration Act 1953_ provides an administrative penalty for breach of this subsection.

##### 4810  Membership requirements of a GST group

    * (1) An entity **_satisfies the membership requirements _**of a *GST group, or a proposed GST group, if the entity:

      * (a) is:

        * (i) a *company; or

        * (ii) a *partnership, trust or individual that satisfies the requirements specified in the regulations; and

      * (b) is, if the entity is a company, a company of the same *90% owned group as all the other members of the GST group or proposed GST group that are also companies; and

      * (c) is *registered; and

      * (d) has the same tax periods applying to it as the tax periods applying to all the other members of the GST group or proposed GST group; and

    * (2) Paragraph (1)(b) does not apply if:

      * (a) the entity is a nonprofit body; and

      * (b) all the other members of the GST group or proposed GST group are nonprofit bodies; and

      * (c) the entity and all those other members are members of the same *nonprofit association.

          * Note 1: For the membership requirements of nonprofit subentities, see section 6350. 

          * Note 2: For the membership requirements of a GST group of government related entities, see section 14925. 

    * (2A) Paragraph (1)(d) does not apply in relation to a tax period that the Commissioner has determined under section 2730 if the tax period:

      * (a) ends at the same time as a tax period (a **_corresponding tax period_**) of each of the other *members of the *GST group; and

      * (b) is not longer than any corresponding tax period (other than a tax period that the Commissioner has determined under section 2730).

    * (3) A *company does not satisfy the membership requirements of a *GST group, or a proposed GST group, if:

      * (a) one or more other members of the GST group or proposed GST group are not companies; and

      * (b) none of the members of the GST group or proposed GST group that are companies satisfy section 4815.

##### 4815  Relationship of companies and noncompanies in a GST group

    * (1) A *company that is a member of a *GST group, or a proposed GST group, satisfies this section if:

      * (a) a *partnership, trust or individual that is a member of the GST group or proposed GST group would, if it were another company, have *at least a 90% stake in that company; or

      * (b) the company has only one member, and that member:

        * (i) is a partner in a partnership that is a member of the GST group or proposed GST group; or

        * (iii) is a *family member of that partner or individual; or

      * (c) the company has more than one member, each of whom is:

        * (i) a partner in the same partnership that is a member of the GST group or proposed GST group; or

      * and one of the following applies: 

        * (iii) at least 2 of the partners are members of the company;

        * (iv) one of the partners is a member of the company, and at least one other member of the company is a family member of a different partner;

        * (v) none of the partners is a member of the company, and the members of the company are not all family members of the same partner and no other partner; or

      * (d) the company has more than one member, each of whom is:

        * (i) an individual who is a member of the GST group or proposed GST group; or

        * (ii) a family member of that individual; or

      * (e) a trust is a member of the GST group or proposed GST group, and distributions of income or capital of the trust are not made except to an entity that is:

        * (i) the company; or

        * (ii) any other company that is a member of the GST group or proposed GST group; or

        * (iia) a member of, or a family member of a member of, any company referred to in subparagraph (i) or (ii) that is a company to which subsection (1A) applies; or

        * (iii) an *endorsed charity or a *giftdeductible entity.

    * (1A) This subsection applies to a company if:

      * (a) the company has only one member; or

      * (b) the company has more than one member, and:

        * (i) at least 2 of the members are beneficiaries of the trust in question (either directly, or indirectly through one or more interposed trusts); or

        * (ii) one of the members is such a beneficiary, and at least one other such beneficiary is a *family member of a different member of the company; or

        * (iii) none of the members is such a beneficiary, and those family members (of the members of the company) who are such beneficiaries are not all family members of the same member of the company and no other member.

    * (2) A person is a **_family member_** of an individual if the individual's family, within the meaning of section 27295 of Schedule 2F to the *ITAA 1936, includes that person. There are no family members of an entity that is not an individual.

##### Subdivision 48B--Consequences of GST groups

##### 4840  Who is liable for GST

    * (1) GST that is payable on any *taxable supply an entity makes and that is attributable to a tax period during which the entity is a *member of a *GST group:

      * (a) is payable by the *representative member; and

      * (b) is not payable by the entity that made it (unless the entity is the representative member).

          * Note: However, each member may be jointly and severally liable to pay the GST that is payable by the representative member (see section 44490 in Schedule 1 to the _Taxation Administration Act 1953_).

    * (1A) GST that is payable on any *taxable importation an entity makes while the entity is a *member of a *GST group:

      * (a) is payable by the *representative member; and

      * (b) is not payable by the member that made it (unless the member is the representative member).

          * Note: However, each member may be jointly and severally liable to pay the GST that is payable by the representative member (see section 44490 in Schedule 1 to the _Taxation Administration Act 1953_).

    * (2) However:

      * (a) a supply that an entity makes to another *member of the same *GST group is treated as if it were not a *taxable supply, unless:

        * (i) it is a taxable supply because of Division 84 (which is about offshore supplies other than goods or real property); or

        * (ii) the entity is a participant in a *GST joint venture and acquired the thing supplied from the *joint venture operator for the joint venture; and

      * (b) this section only applies to GST payable on a *taxable importation made, by a member of the GST group other than the *representative member, if the GST on the importation is payable at a time when GST on *taxable supplies is normally payable by the representative member.

    * (3) This section has effect despite sections 940 and 1315 (which are about liability for GST).

##### 4845  Who is entitled to input tax credits

    * (1) If an entity makes a *creditable acquisition or *creditable importation the input tax credit for which is attributable to a tax period during which the entity is a *member of a *GST group:

      * (a) the *representative member is entitled to the input tax credit on the acquisition or importation; and

      * (b) the entity making the acquisition or importation is not entitled to the input tax credit on the acquisition or importation (unless the entity is the representative member).

    * (2) In deciding, for the purposes of subsection (1), whether an acquisition or importation by an entity is a *creditable acquisition or *creditable importation, the acquisition or importation is treated as being solely or partly for a *creditable purpose if, and only if, it would be so treated if:

      * (a) the GST group were treated as a single entity; and

      * (b) the GST group were not treated as a number of entities corresponding to the members of the GST group.

    * (3) However, an acquisition that an entity makes from another *member of the same *GST group is not a *creditable acquisition unless the supply of the thing acquired by the entity was a *taxable supply because of Division 84 (which is about offshore supplies other than goods or real property).

    * (4) This section has effect despite sections 115 and 155 (which are about what are creditable acquisitions and creditable importations), and sections 1120 and 1515 (which are about who is entitled to input tax credits).

##### 4850  Adjustments

    * (1) Any *adjustment that an entity has and that is attributable to a tax period during which the entity is a *member of a *GST group is to be treated as if:

      * (a) the entity did not have the adjustment (unless the entity is the *representative member); and

      * (b) the representative member had the adjustment.

    * (2) This section has effect despite section 1710 (which is about the effect of adjustments on net amounts).

##### 4851  Consequences of being a member of a GST group for part of a tax period

    * (1) If you are a *member of a *GST group only for one or more parts of a tax period:

      * (a) section 4840 does not apply to the GST payable on a *taxable supply that you make, to the extent that the GST would be attributable to a period to which subsection (2) applies if it were a tax period applying to you; and

      * (b) section 4840 does not apply to the GST payable on a *taxable importation that you make during a period to which subsection (2) applies; and

      * (c) section 4845 does not apply to the input tax credit for a *creditable acquisition or *creditable importation that you make, to the extent that the input tax credit would be attributable to a period to which subsection (2) applies if it were a tax period applying to you; and

      * (d) section 4850 does not apply to an *adjustment that you have that would be attributable to a period to which subsection (2) applies if it were a tax period applying to you.

    * (2) This section applies to any period, during the tax period, during which you were not a *member of that *GST group or any other GST group.

##### 4852  Consequences for a representative member of membership change during a tax period

    * (1) If an entity is a *member of a *GST group, of which you are the *representative member, only for one or more parts of a tax period:

      * (a) section 4840 only applies to the GST payable on a *taxable supply that the entity makes, to the extent that the GST would be attributable to a period to which subsection (2) applies if it were a tax period applying to the entity; and

      * (b) section 4840 only applies to the GST payable on a *taxable importation that the entity makes during a period to which subsection (2) applies; and

      * (c) section 4845 only applies to the input tax credit for a *creditable acquisition or *creditable importation that the entity makes, to the extent that the input tax credit would be attributable to a period to which subsection (2) applies if it were a tax period applying to the entity; and

      * (d) section 4850 only applies to an *adjustment that the entity has that would be attributable to a period to which subsection (2) applies if it were a tax period applying to the entity.

    * (2) This section applies to any period, during the tax period, during which the entity was a *member of the *GST group of which you are the *representative member.

    * (3) However, if you are the *representative member of the *GST group only for one or more parts of the tax period, this section has effect subject to section 4853.

    * (4) If an entity is a *member of different *GST groups during the same tax period, subsections (1) and (2) apply separately in relation to each of those groups.

##### 4853  Consequences of changing a representative member during a tax period

    * (1) If you are the *representative member of a *GST group only for one or more parts of a tax period, then, in relation to your capacity as the representative member:

      * (a) section 4840 only applies to the GST payable on a *taxable supply that an entity makes, to the extent that the GST would be attributable to a period to which subsection (2) applies if it were a tax period applying to you; and

      * (b) section 4840 only applies to the GST payable on a *taxable importation that an entity makes during a period to which subsection (2) applies; and

      * (c) section 4845 only applies to the input tax credit for a *creditable acquisition or *creditable importation that an entity makes, to the extent that the input tax credit would be attributable to a period to which subsection (2) applies if it were a tax period applying to you; and

      * (d) section 4850 only applies to an *adjustment that an entity has that would be attributable to a period to which subsection (2) applies if it were a tax period applying to you.

    * (2) This section applies to any period, during the tax period, during which you were the *representative member of the *GST group.

##### 4855  GST groups treated as single entities for certain purposes

    * (1) Despite sections 4845 and 4850, a *GST group is treated as a single entity, and not as a number of entities corresponding to the *members of the GST group, for the purposes of working out:

      * (a) the amounts of any input tax credits to which the *representative member is entitled; and

      * (b) whether the representative member has any *adjustments; and

      * (c) the amounts of any such adjustments.

    * (1A) If:

      * (a) while you were not a *member of any *GST group, you acquired or imported a thing; and

      * (b) you become a member of a GST group at a time when you still hold the thing;

    * then, when the *representative member of the GST group applies section 12940 for the first time after you became a member of the GST group, the *intended or former application of the thing is the extent of *creditable purpose last used to work out:

      * (c) the amount of the input tax credit to which you were entitled for the acquisition or importation; or

      * (d) the amount of any *adjustment you had under Division 129 in relation to the thing;

    * as the case requires.

    * (2) This section has effect despite section 1125 (which is about the amount of input tax credits) and section 1710 (which is about the effect of adjustments on net amounts).

##### 4857  Tax invoices that are required to identify recipients

    * (1) A document issued for a supply is taken to be a **_tax invoice_** if:

      * (a) it would not, but for this section, be a tax invoice because it does not contain enough information to enable the identity, or the *ABN, of the *recipient of the supply to be clearly ascertained; and

      * (b) there is no other reason why it would not be a tax invoice; and

      * (c) the *representative member of a *GST group is entitled under section 4845 to an input tax credit for the *creditable acquisition relating to the supply; and

      * (d) the document contains enough information to enable the identity of at least one of the following to be clearly ascertained:

        * (i) the GST group;

        * (ii) the representative member;

        * (iii) another entity that is or was a *member of the GST group, if the representative member would still have been entitled under section 4845 to that input tax credit if that other entity had been the recipient of the supply.

            * Note: Subparagraph (d)(iii) ensures that a member of the GST group identified in the document was a member of the group at the relevant time for the supply in question.

    * (2) However, any obligation that the supplier of a *taxable supply has under subsection 2970(2) is an obligation to give to the *recipient of the supply a document that would be a *tax invoice for the supply even if subsection (1) of this section had not been enacted.

          * Note: This subsection ensures that a recipient's entitlement to a tax invoice, including (if subparagraph 2970(1)(c)(ii) requires it) an entitlement to a tax invoice that enables the recipient's identity or the recipient's ABN to be clearly ascertained, is unaffected by this section.

    * (3) This section has effect despite section 2970 (which is about tax invoices).

##### 4860  GST returns

    * (1) If you are a *member of a *GST group during the whole of a tax period, you are not required to give to the Commissioner a *GST return for that tax period, unless you are the *representative member of the group during that period.

          * Note: If you were not a member of a GST group during the whole of a tax period, you are still obliged to give a GST return for the tax period, and (because of section 4851) your net amount for the tax period will take into account your liabilities and entitlements relating to the one or more parts of the tax period during which you were not a member.

    * (2) This section has effect despite section 315 (which is about who must give GST returns).

##### Subdivision 48C--Administrative matters

##### 4870  Changing the membership etc. of GST groups

    * (1) The following actions may be taken, in accordance with subsection (2), in relation to a *GST group:

      * (a) the *representative member of the group may, with the written agreement of an entity that *satisfies the membership requirements of the GST group, add the entity to the group;

      * (b) the representative member may leave the group; or

      * (c) another *member of the group, nominated by the members, who is an *Australian resident may become the new representative member; or

      * (d) the representative member may remove from the group any other member of the group; or

      * (e) if a member of the group is an *incapacitated entity--the entity's *representative may remove the entity from the group; or

      * (f) the representative member may dissolve the group.

    * (2) The action is to be taken by notice given to the Commissioner, in the *approved form, by:

      * (a) if paragraph (1)(a), (d) or (f) applies--the *representative member; or

      * (b) if paragraph (1)(b) or (c) applies--the new representative member of the group; or

      * (c) if paragraph (1)(e) applies--the *representative of the *incapacitated entity.

    * (3) The action takes effect from the start of the day specified in the notice (whether that day is before, on or after the day on which the notice was given to the Commissioner).

    * (4) However, if the notice was given to the Commissioner after the day by which the *representative member of the group, or the entity nominated to be the new representative member of the group, is required to give to the Commissioner a *GST return for the tax period in which the day specified in the notice occurs, the action takes effect from the start of:

      * (a) the day specified in the notice, if that day is approved by the Commissioner under section 4871; and

      * (b) if paragraph (a) does not apply--such other day as the Commissioner approves under that section.

    * (5) Despite subsections (3) and (4), action taken under paragraph (1)(e) cannot take effect earlier than the day on which the *member of the group became an *incapacitated entity.

    * (6) A *GST group is taken to be dissolved if:

      * (a) a *member of the group ceases to be the *representative member of the group; and

      * (b) no other member of the group becomes the representative member of the group, with effect from the day after the previous representative member ceased to be the representative member of the group.

    * (7) A notice that another *member of the *GST group has become the *representative member of the group must be given to the Commissioner within 21 days after the other member became the representative member.

          * Note: Section 28675 in Schedule 1 to the _Taxation Administration Act 1953_ provides an administrative penalty for breach of this subsection.

##### 4871  Approval of early day of effect of forming, changing etc. GST groups

    * (1) If an entity that gives a notice to the Commissioner under paragraph 485(1)(c) or subsection 4870(2) applies, in the *approved form, to the Commissioner for approval of a day specified in the notice, the Commissioner must:

      * (a) approve, for the purposes of subsection 485(4) or 4870(4), the day specified in the notice; or

      * (b) approve another day for those purposes.

          * Note: Approving another day under paragraph (b) is a reviewable GST decision (see Subdivision 110F in Schedule 1 to the _Taxation Administration Act 1953_).

    * (2) The Commissioner may revoke an approval given under subsection (1) if the Commissioner is satisfied that the day approved is not appropriate.

          * Note: Revoking an approval under this subsection is a reviewable GST decision (see Subdivision 110F in Schedule 1 to the _Taxation Administration Act 1953_).

    * (3) The Commissioner must give notice, to the entity referred to in subsection (1), of any decision that he or she makes under this section.

##### 4873  Tax periods of GST groups with incapacitated members

    * (1) If a *member of a *GST group becomes an *incapacitated entity, the *representative member of that group may, by notifying the Commissioner in the *approved form, elect for the tax period that applies at the time to the members of the group to end at the same time as the incapacitated entity's tax period ends under subsection 2739(1).

          * Note 1: Section 3110 provides for when a GST return must be given to the Commissioner for a tax period other than a quarterly tax period.

          * Note 2: If the representative member does not make an election under this section when a member of the group becomes an incapacitated entity, the member's membership of the group may cease if, because of section 2739, the tax periods applying to it are not the same as those applying to the other members of the group.

    * (1A) If an entity ceases to be the *representative member of a *GST group as a result of becoming an *incapacitated entity, the entity may make an election under subsection (1), in relation to becoming an incapacitated entity, as if the entity were still the representative member of the group.

    * (1B) A notice under subsection (1) must be given to the Commissioner within 21 days after the *member becomes an *incapacitated entity.

    * (2) If a tax period (the **_first tax period_**) ends on a particular day because of subsection (1), the next tax period starts on the day after that day and ends when the first tax period would have ended but for that subsection.

    * (3) This section has effect despite Division 27 (which is about how to work out the tax periods that apply).

##### 4875  Effect of representative member becoming an incapacitated entity

    * (1) If:

      * (a) the *representative member of a *GST group becomes an *incapacitated entity; and

##### Subdivision 51A--Formation of and participation in GST joint ventures

##### 515  Formation of GST joint ventures

      * (f) if the nominated joint venture operator is not a party to the joint venture agreement--the nominated joint venture operator satisfies the requirements of paragraphs 5110(c) and (f).

    * Such a joint venture is a **_GST joint venture_**.

    * (2) Not all of the entities that are engaged in, or intend to engage in, the joint venture need to become *participants in the *GST joint venture.

    * (3) The *formation of the *GST joint venture takes effect from the start of the day specified in the notice under paragraph (1)(eb) (whether that day is before, on or after the day on which the entities decided to form the joint venture).

    * (4) However, if the notice was given to the Commissioner after the day by which the entity nominated to be the *joint venture operator of the *GST joint venture is required to give to the Commissioner a *GST return for the tax period in which the day specified in the notice occurs, the *formation of the GST joint venture takes effect from the start of:

      * (a) the day specified in the notice, if that day is approved by the Commissioner under section 5175; and

      * (b) ceased to *satisfy the participation requirements for the joint venture.

    * (3) The *joint venture operator of a *GST joint venture must notify the Commissioner, in the *approved form, if a *participant in the joint venture no longer *satisfies the participation requirements for the GST joint venture.

    * (4) The notice must be given within 21 days after the *participant no longer *satisfies the participation requirements for the *GST joint venture.

          * Note: Section 28675 in Schedule 1 to the _Taxation Administration Act 1953_ provides an administrative penalty for breach of this subsection.

      * (b) is not payable by the participant.

          * Note: However, each participant may be jointly and severally liable to pay the GST that is payable by the joint venture operator (see section 44480 in Schedule 1 to the _Taxation Administration Act 1953_).

    * (2) However, a supply that the *joint venture operator of a *GST joint venture makes is treated as if it were not a *taxable supply if:

      * (a) it is made to another entity that is a *participant in the joint venture; and

      * (b) the participant acquired the thing supplied for consumption, use or supply in the course of activities for which the joint venture was entered into.

    * (1) Any *adjustment relating to any supply, acquisition or importation that the *joint venture operator of a *GST joint venture makes, on behalf of another entity that is a *participant in the joint venture, in the course of activities for which the joint venture was entered into is to be treated as if:

      * (a) the participant did not have the adjustment; and

      * (b) the entity that is the joint venture operator at the time the adjustment arises had the adjustment.

    * (2) This section has effect despite section 1710 (which is about the effect of adjustments on net amounts).

##### 5145  Additional net amounts relating to GST joint ventures

    * (1) Division 17 applies to the *joint venture operator of a *GST joint venture as if the joint venture operator had an additional *net amount, relating to the joint venture, for each tax period.

    * (2) The additional *net amount relating to the joint venture is worked out as if the joint venture operator:

      * (a) is only liable for the GST on *taxable supplies that the joint venture operator makes, on behalf of another entity that is a *participant in the joint venture, in the course of activities for which the joint venture was entered into; and

      * (b) is only entitled to the input tax credits for *creditable acquisitions or *creditable importations that the joint venture operator makes on behalf of another entity that is a participant in the joint venture, in the course of activities for which the joint venture was entered into; and

      * (c) only has adjustments relating to supplies, acquisitions or importations that the joint venture operator makes, on behalf of another entity that is a participant in the joint venture, in the course of activities for which the joint venture was entered into.

    * (2A) However, while an election made by the *joint venture operator under section 5152 has effect: 

      * (a) Division 17 applies to the joint venture operator as if the joint venture operator had an additional *net amount, relating to all the *GST joint ventures for which the joint venture operator is the joint venture operator, for each tax period; and 

      * (b) that additional net amount is worked out by aggregating what would be the additional *net amounts relating to each GST joint venture under subsection (2) if that subsection applied.

    * Disallowance of elections 

    * (5) The Commissioner may disallow the election if the Commissioner is satisfied that the *joint venture operator has a history of failing to comply with the joint venture operator's obligations (either as a joint venture operator or in any other capacity) under a *taxation law. 

          * Note: Disallowing an election is a reviewable GST decision (see Subdivision 110F in Schedule 1 to the _Taxation Administration Act 1953_).

      * (b) you cease to be a participant in the GST joint venture;

    * then, when applying section 12940 for the first time after that cessation, the *intended or former application of the thing is the extent of *creditable purpose last used to work out:

      * (c) under section 5135, the amount of the input tax credit to which the *joint venture operator was entitled for the acquisition or importation; or

      * (d) under section 5140, the amount of any *adjustment the joint venture operator had under Division 129 in relation to the acquisition or importation.

    * (2) If:

      * (a) while you were a *participant in a *GST joint venture, you acquired or imported a thing by the joint venture operator acquiring or importing it on your behalf; and

      * (b) you have ceased to be a participant in the GST joint venture; and

      * (c) you have an *adjustment under Division 129 in relation to the acquisition or importation;

    * then, for the purposes of working out the full input tax credit in section 12970 or 12975, you are taken not to have been a participant of a GST joint venture when you acquired or imported the thing.

      * 54B	Consequences of registration of GST branches

      * 54C	Cancellation of registration of GST branches

##### 541  What this Division is about

    * A branch of a registered entity can be separately registered as a GST branch. Separate GST returns are given, and separate payments and refunds of GST are made, in respect of the branch.

##### Subdivision 54A--Registration of GST branches

##### 545  Registration of GST branches

    * (1) The Commissioner must *register a branch of a *registered entity if:

      * (a) the registered entity applies, in the *approved form, for registration of the branch; and

      * (b) the Commissioner is satisfied that the branch maintains an independent system of accounting, and can be separately identified by reference to:

        * (i) the nature of the activities carried on through the branch; or

        * (ii) the location of the branch; and

      * (c) the Commissioner is satisfied that the registered entity is *carrying on an *enterprise through the branch, or intends to carry on an enterprise through the branch, from a particular date specified in the application.

    * A branch that is so registered is a **_GST branch_**.

    * (2) A branch of a *registered entity can be registered as a *GST branch without all or any of the other branches of the entity being so registered.

    * (3) However, a branch of a *registered entity cannot be registered as a *GST branch if the registered entity is a *member of a *GST group.

          * Note: Refusing an application for registration under this section is a reviewable GST decision (see Subdivision 110F in Schedule 1 to the _Taxation Administration Act 1953_).

##### 5410  The date of effect of registration of a GST branch

    * The Commissioner must decide the date from which *registration as a *GST branch takes effect. However, the date of effect must not be a day before:

      * (a) the day specified in the application for that purpose; or

      * (b) if the branch is being registered only because it is intended that an *enterprise be *carried on through the branch--the date of effect must not be a day before the day specified, in the application, as the day from which it is intended to carry on the enterprise through the branch.

          * Note: Deciding the date of effect of registration as a GST branch is a reviewable GST decision (see Subdivision 110F in Schedule 1 to the _Taxation Administration Act 1953_).

##### 5415  GST branch registration number

    * If the Commissioner *registers a *GST branch, the Commissioner must notify the registered entity of the branch's *GST branch registration number.

##### Subdivision 54B--Consequences of registration of GST branches

##### 5440  Additional net amounts relating to GST branches

    * (1) If an entity (the **_parent entity_**) has a *GST branch, Division 17 applies to the parent entity as if it had an additional *net amount, relating to the branch, for each tax period.

    * (2) The additional *net amount relating to the branch is worked out as if the branch were a separate entity and as if:

      * (a) all the supplies, acquisitions and importations made through the branch were made by that separate entity; and

      * (b) all the *adjustments that the parent entity has arising from such supplies, acquisitions and importations were adjustments that the branch has; and

      * (c) all transfers of anything by the branch to the parent entity (including any other branch of the parent entity), that would have been supplies made by the branch if it were an entity, were supplies made by the separate entity; and

      * (d) all transfers of anything by the parent entity (including any other branch of the parent entity) to the branch, that would have been acquisitions made by the branch if it were an entity, were acquisitions made by the separate entity; and

      * (e) all adjustments that the branch would have had, if it were an entity, relating to the supplies and acquisitions it would have made as mentioned in paragraphs (c) and (d), were adjustments that the branch had.

    * (3) This section has effect despite sections 175 and 1710 (which are about net amounts and adjustments).

##### 5445  Net amounts of parent entities

    * (1) If an entity (the **_parent entity_**) has a *GST branch, the parent entity's *net amount is worked out as if:

      * (a) all the supplies, acquisitions and importations made through any GST branch of the parent entity were not supplies for which the parent entity is liable for GST, or acquisitions or importations for which the parent entity is entitled to input tax credits; and

      * (b) the parent entity does not have any *adjustments arising from such supplies, acquisitions and importations; and

      * (c) all transfers of anything by the parent entity to any GST branch of the parent entity, that would have been supplies made to the branch if it were an entity, were supplies made by the parent entity; and

      * (d) all transfers of anything by any GST branch of the parent entity to the parent entity, that would have been acquisitions made from the branch if it were an entity, were acquisitions made by the parent entity; and

      * (e) all adjustments that the parent entity would have had, if the GST branches of the parent entity were entities, relating to the supplies and acquisitions the parent entity would have made as mentioned in paragraphs (c) and (d), were adjustments that the parent entity had.

    * (2) However, the parent entity has no *net amount under this section if all the *enterprises that it *carries on are carried on through its *GST branches.

    * (3) This section has effect despite sections 175 and 1710 (which are about net amounts and adjustments).

##### 5450  Tax invoices and adjustment notes

    * (1) The *GST branch registration number of a *GST branch must be set out in:

      * (a) any *tax invoice relating to a *taxable supply made through that GST branch; and

      * (b) any *adjustment note for a *decreasing adjustment that arose from the occurrence of an *adjustment event relating to a *taxable supply made through that GST branch; and

      * (c) any *third party adjustment note for a decreasing adjustment under section 1345 that relates to a taxable supply made through that GST branch.

    * (2) This section has effect despite sections 2970 and 2975 (which are about tax invoices and adjustment notes), and section 13420 (which is about third party adjustment notes).

##### 5455  GST returns relating to GST branches

    * (1) An entity must, in relation to each *GST branch of the entity, give to the Commissioner a *GST return for each tax period applying to the entity.

    * (3) The entity must still give a *GST return under section 315, unless all the *enterprises that it *carries on are carried on through its *GST branches.

    * (4) This section has effect despite section 315 (which is about who must give GST returns).

##### 5460  Payments of GST relating to GST branches

    * (1) If an entity has a *GST branch and the *assessed net amount relating to the *GST branch for a tax period is greater than zero:

      * (a) the entity must pay that assessed net amount to the Commissioner; and

      * (b) Division 33 applies to payment of that amount as if it were a payment the entity was obliged to make under section 333 or 335 (as the case requires).

    * (2) This section has effect despite Division 33 (which is about payments of GST).

##### 5465  Refunds relating to GST branches

    * If an entity has a *GST branch and the *assessed net amount relating to the *GST branch for a tax period is less than zero, the Commissioner must, on behalf of the Commonwealth, pay that assessed net amount (expressed as a positive amount) to the entity.

          * Note 1: See Division 3A of Part IIB of  the _Taxation Administration Act 1953_ for the rules about how the Commissioner must pay the entity. Division 3 of Part IIB allows the Commissioner to apply the amount owing as a credit against tax debts that the entity owes to the Commonwealth.

          * Note 2: Interest is payable under the _Taxation (Interest on Overpayments and Early Payments) Act 1983_ if the Commissioner is late in refunding the amount.

##### Subdivision 54C--Cancellation of registration of GST branches

##### 5470  When an entity must apply for cancellation of registration of a GST branch

    * (1) If an entity has a *GST branch and the entity is not *carrying on any *enterprise through the branch, the entity must apply to the Commissioner in the *approved form for cancellation of the *registration of the branch.

    * (2) The entity must lodge its application within 21 days after the day on which it ceased to *carry on any *enterprise through the branch.

##### 5475  When the Commissioner must cancel registration of a GST branch

    * (1) The Commissioner must cancel the *registration of a *GST branch of an entity if:

      * (a) the entity has applied for cancellation of registration in the *approved form; and

      * (b) at the time it applied, the branch had been registered for at least 12 months.

          * Note: Refusing to cancel the registration of a GST branch under this subsection is a reviewable GST decision (see Subdivision 110F in Schedule 1 to the _Taxation Administration Act 1953_).

    * (2) The Commissioner must cancel the *registration of a *GST branch of the entity (even if the entity has not applied for cancellation of the registration) if:

      * (a) the Commissioner is satisfied that the entity is not *carrying on an *enterprise through the branch; and

      * (b) the Commissioner believes on reasonable grounds that the entity is unlikely to carry on an enterprise through the branch for at least 12 months.

          * Note: Cancelling the registration of a GST branch under this subsection is a reviewable GST decision (see Subdivision 110F in Schedule 1 to the _Taxation Administration Act 1953_).

    * (3) The Commissioner must notify the entity of any decision he or she makes in relation to it under this section. If the Commissioner decides to cancel the *registration, the notice must specify the date of effect of the cancellation.

##### 5480  The date of effect of cancellation of registration of a GST branch

    * The Commissioner must decide the date on which the cancellation of the *registration of a *GST branch of an entity under subsection 5475(1) or (2) takes effect. That date may be any day occurring before, on or after the day on which the Commissioner makes the decision.

          * Note: Deciding the date of effect of the cancellation of the registration of a GST branch is a reviewable GST decision (see Subdivision 110F in Schedule 1 to the _Taxation Administration Act 1953_).

##### 5725  Cancellation of registration of a resident agent

    * (1) The Commissioner must cancel the *registration of a *resident agent if the Commissioner is satisfied that the resident agent is not *required to be registered.

          * Note: Cancelling the registration of a resident agent under this subsection is a reviewable GST decision (see Subdivision 110F in Schedule 1 to the _Taxation Administration Act 1953_).

    * (2) The Commissioner must notify the *resident agent of the cancellation.

##### 5735  Tax periods of resident agents

    * (1) If you are a *resident agent who is acting as agent for a *nonresident, the Commissioner must determine that the **_tax periods_** that apply to you are each individual month if the Commissioner is satisfied that the nonresident's *GST turnover meets the *tax period turnover threshold.

    * This Division does not apply in relation to a *nonresident that is a *member of a *GST group.

#### Division 58--Representatives of incapacitated entities

##### 581  What this Division is about

    * This Division sets out how to ascribe activities of a representative of an incapacitated entity between the representative and the incapacitated entity for GST purposes.

    * In particular, supplies, acquisitions and importations, and associated acts and omissions, by the representative are, in most cases, treated as having been by the incapacitated entity. This ensures that a transaction by the representative has the same consequences under the GST law as if the incapacitated entity had no representative.

    * However, in most cases, GSTrelated liabilities and entitlements are allocated to the representative for transactions that are within the scope of the representative's responsibility or authority.

          * Note: This Division does not apply to a representative to the extent that paragraph 1055(1)(a) (which is about supplies by creditors in satisfaction of debts) will apply to its supplies. See section 5895.

##### 585  General principle for the relationship between incapacitated entities and their representatives

    * (1) Subject to this Division, any supply, acquisition or importation by an entity in the capacity of a *representative of another entity that is an *incapacitated entity is taken to be a supply, acquisition or importation by the other entity.

    * (2) Subject to this Division, any other act, or any omission, of an entity in the capacity of a *representative of another entity that is an *incapacitated entity is taken to be an act or omission of the other entity, but only for the purposes of determining, for the purposes of the *GST law:

      * (a) whether a supply or importation is a *taxable supply or *taxable importation, or the amount of GST payable on the supply or importation; or

      * (b) whether an acquisition or importation is a *creditable acquisition or *creditable importation, or the amount of the input tax credit for the acquisition or importation; or

      * (c) whether an *adjustment arises in relation to a supply, acquisition or importation, or the amount of such an adjustment.

    * (3) To avoid doubt, if the other entity ceases to be an *incapacitated entity, this section continues to apply in relation to the supply, acquisition or importation, or to the act or omission, after the other entity ceases to be an incapacitated entity.

    * (4) To avoid doubt, to the extent that an act or omission referred to in subsection (2) relates to deciding to *account on a cash basis, that subsection does not apply for the purposes of determining, for the purposes of the *GST law, whether an *adjustment arises under Division 21 in relation to a supply or acquisition.

##### 5810  Circumstances in which representatives have GSTrelated liabilities and entitlements

    * General rule

    * (1) A *representative of an *incapacitated entity:

      * (a) is liable to pay any GST that the incapacitated entity would, but for this section or section 4840, be liable to pay on a *taxable supply or a *taxable importation; and

      * (b) is entitled to any input tax credit that the incapacitated entity would, but for this section or section 4845, be entitled to for a *creditable acquisition or a *creditable importation; and

      * (c) has any *adjustment that the incapacitated entity would, but for this section or section 4850, have;

    * to the extent that the making of the supply, importation or acquisition to which the GST, input tax credit or adjustment relates is within the scope of the representative's responsibility or authority for managing the incapacitated entity's affairs.

    * Exceptions for certain taxable supplies

    * (2) This section does not apply to the GST payable on a *taxable supply to the extent that one or more of the following apply:

      * (a) the *incapacitated entity received the *consideration for the supply before the *representative became a representative of the incapacitated entity;

      * (b) if, under Division 83 or 84, the GST is payable by the recipient of the supply--the incapacitated entity provided the consideration for the supply before the representative became a representative of the incapacitated entity;

      * (c) if:

        * (i) the supply is a supply for which a *voucher to which Division 100 applies is redeemed; and

        * (ii) the incapacitated entity supplied the voucher before the representative became a representative of the incapacitated entity;

      * the consideration for the supply referred to in subparagraph (i) does not exceed the consideration provided for the incapacitated entity's supply of the voucher.

    * Exception for certain creditable acquisitions

    * (3) This section does not apply to an input tax credit for a *creditable acquisition to the extent that the *incapacitated entity provided the *consideration for the acquisition before the *representative became a representative of the incapacitated entity.

    * (4) This section does not apply to an *adjustment to the extent that one or more of the following apply:

      * (a) if the adjustment relates to a supply--the *incapacitated entity received the *consideration for the supply before the *representative became a representative of the incapacitated entity;

      * (b) if the adjustment relates to an acquisition--the incapacitated entity provided the consideration for the supply before the representative became a representative of the incapacitated entity;

      * (c) the adjustment would not be attributable to a tax period applying to the representative in the capacity of a representative of the incapacitated entity.

    * Incapacitated entity not liable to pay GST etc.

    * (5) An *incapacitated entity or, if the incapacitated entity is a *member of a *GST group, the *representative member of that group:

      * (a) is not liable to pay the GST on a *taxable supply or a *taxable importation to the extent that a *representative of the incapacitated entity is liable under this section to pay the GST on the supply or importation; and

      * (b) is not entitled to the input tax credit for a *creditable acquisition or a *creditable importation to the extent that a representative of the incapacitated entity is entitled under this section to the input tax credit for the acquisition or importation; and

      * (c) does not have an *adjustment to the extent that a representative of the incapacitated entity has the adjustment under this section.

    * Other

##### 5815  Adjustments for bad debts

    * (1) For the purposes of determining whether an *adjustment arises under section 215 or 2115 for the whole or a part of a debt relating to a *taxable supply or *creditable acquisition for which a *representative of an *incapacitated entity is liable to pay GST, or is entitled to an input tax credit, under section 5810:

      * (a) the adjustment cannot arise if, when the whole or part of the debt is written off, or has been *overdue for 12 months, the representative *accounts on a cash basis; but

      * (b) it does not matter whether the incapacitated entity accounts on a cash basis at that or any other time.

    * (2) This section has effect despite subsections 215(2) and 2115(2) (which preclude adjustments for bad debts when accounting on a cash basis).

##### 5825  Cancellation of registration of a representative

    * (1) The Commissioner must cancel the *registration of a *representative of an *incapacitated entity if the Commissioner is satisfied that the representative is not *required to be registered in that capacity.

          * Note: Cancelling the registration of a representative under this subsection is a reviewable GST decision (see Subdivision 110F in Schedule 1 to the _Taxation Administration Act 1953_).

    * (2) The Commissioner must notify the *representative of the cancellation.

    * (3) Sections 2550 and 2555 do not apply to the cancellation of the *registration of a *representative of an *incapacitated entity.

##### 5830  Notice of cessation of representation

    * A *representative who ceases to be a representative of an *incapacitated entity must notify the Commissioner of that cessation, in the *approved form, within 21 days after so ceasing.

##### 5835  Tax periods of representatives

    * (1) If a *representative of an *incapacitated entity is *required to be registered in that capacity, the tax periods applying to the representative in that capacity are the same tax periods that apply to the incapacitated entity.

    * (2) This section has effect despite Division 27 (which is about how to work out the tax periods that apply).

##### 5840  Effect on attribution rules of not accounting on a cash basis

    * (1) If:

      * (a) a *representative of an *incapacitated entity does not *account on a cash basis; and

      * (b) because of section 5810, all or part of the amount of GST payable on a *taxable supply is payable by the representative, or the representative is entitled to all or part of the input tax credit for a *creditable acquisition;

    * then, to the extent that, but for this section, the GST or input tax credit would be attributable to a tax period that ended before the representative became a representative of the incapacitated entity, the GST or input tax credit is instead attributable to the first tax period applying to the representative in that capacity.

    * (2) This section has effect despite sections 295 and 2910 (which are about attribution of GST on taxable supplies and of input tax credits for creditable acquisitions).

##### 5845  GST returns for representatives of incapacitated entities

    * (1) If an individual is appointed as a *representative of 2 or more *incapacitated entities, the individual may give to the Commissioner one *GST return for a tax period in respect of the entities if the entities are *members of the same *GST group.

    * (2) This section has effect despite section 315 (which is about who must give GST returns).

##### 5850  Representatives to give GST returns for incapacitated entities

    * (1) A *representative of an *incapacitated entity must give to the Commissioner a *GST return for a tax period applying to the incapacitated entity if:

      * (a) the incapacitated entity has failed to give to the Commissioner a GST return for a tax period; and

      * (b) the Commissioner, in writing, directs the representative to give to the Commissioner a GST return.

          * Note: Deciding to direct a representative of an incapacitated entity to give to the Commissioner a GST return is a reviewable GST decision (see Subdivision 110F in Schedule 1 to the _Taxation Administration Act 1953_).

    * (2) The tax period may be any tax period applying to the *incapacitated entity, including:

      * (a) a tax period that ends before the *representative became a representative of the incapacitated entity; and

      * (b) a tax period that starts after the representative became a representative of the incapacitated entity.

    * (3) The *GST return by the *representative:

      * (a) must be in accordance with the requirements of Division 31 as they would apply in relation to the *incapacitated entity except to the extent that the direction under paragraph (1)(b) modifies those requirements; and

      * (b) must be given to the Commissioner within the period specified in the direction.

    * (4) Without limiting the matters that the Commissioner may take into account in deciding whether to give a direction under paragraph (1)(b), the Commissioner must take into account:

      * (a) the likelihood of a dividend to unsecured creditors of the *incapacitated entity being declared, and the likely amounts of any such dividend; and

      * (b) the likelihood that, if the Commissioner were given the *GST return, it would reveal a liability to pay an amount to the Commissioner under the *GST law; and

      * (c) the availability of books and records that would make it possible to prepare the GST return; and

      * (b) the entity does not have an *increasing adjustment that is attributable to the tax period; and

      * (c) the entity is not liable for GST that is attributable to the tax period.

    * (2) This section has effect despite section 315 (which is about who must give GST returns).

##### 5860  Representative to notify Commissioner of certain liabilities etc.

    * (1) A *representative of an *incapacitated entity must notify the Commissioner, in the *approved form, of an amount of GST for which the entity is liable, or an *increasing adjustment that the entity has, if:

      * (a) the representative becomes aware, or could reasonably be expected to have become aware, of the amount of GST, or the adjustment; and

      * (b) the amount of GST, or the adjustment, has not been taken into account in any *GST return that has been given to the Commissioner; and

      * (c) the Commissioner has not been previously notified of the amount of GST, or the adjustment, under this section.

          * Note: Section 28675 in Schedule 1 to the _Taxation Administration Act 1953_ provides an administrative penalty for breach of this subsection.

    * (2) The notification must be given to the Commissioner before the day on which the *representative declares a dividend to unsecured creditors of the *incapacitated entity.

    * (3) This section does not apply if the *representative is a representative of a kind that does not have the capacity to declare dividends to unsecured creditors of the *incapacitated entity.

    * (4) This section does not apply in circumstances determined by the Commissioner under subsection (5).

    * (5) The Commissioner may, by legislative instrument, determine circumstances in which this section does not apply.

##### 5865  Money available to meet representative's liabilities

    * A *representative of an *incapacitated entity who is liable to pay an amount because of this Division is authorised and required to apply any money which the representative receives in his or her capacity as that representative in order to pay the liability.

##### 5870  Protection for actions of representative

    * A *representative of an *incapacitated entity is not liable to civil or criminal proceedings in relation to an act done, or omitted to be done, in good faith, in the performance or purported performance, or exercise or purported exercise, of the representative's duties or powers under, or in relation to, the *GST law.

##### 5895  Division does not apply to the extent that the representative is a creditor of the incapacitated entity

    * This Division does not apply in relation to a *representative of an entity to the extent that paragraph 1055(1)(a) will apply to a supply by the representative of the entity's property.

          * Note: For example, if the representative:

            * (a) is a mortgagee in possession of the entity's property; and

            * (b) is not a representative of the entity for any other reason;

          * the representative need not register under section 5820 if it will supply that property in or towards the satisfaction of a debt owed to it by the entity.

#### Division 60--Preestablishment costs

##### 601  What this Division is about

    * This Division enables input tax credits to arise in some circumstances in which acquisitions and importations are made before a company is in existence.

##### 605  Input tax credit for acquisitions and importations before establishment

    * (1) If you make a *creditable acquisition that is a*preestablishment acquisition, or a *creditable importation that is a *preestablishment importation, relating to a *company before it is in existence:

      * (a) you are not entitled to the input tax credit on the acquisition or importation; and

      * (b) once the company is in existence, it is entitled to the input tax credit on the acquisition or importation.

    * (2) This section has effect despite sections 1120 and 1515 (which are about who is entitled to input tax credits).

##### 6010  Registration etc. not needed for input tax credits

    * (1) If you make a *preestablishment acquisition, the fact that you are not *registered or *required to be registered does not stop the acquisition being a *creditable acquisition.

    * (2) If you make a *preestablishment importation, the fact that you are not *registered or *required to be registered does not stop the acquisition being a *creditable importation.

    * (3) This section has effect despite sections 115 and 155 (which are about what are creditable acquisitions and creditable importations).

##### 6015  Preestablishment acquisitions and importations

    * (1) An acquisition that you make is a **_preestablishment acquisition_**, and an importation that you make is a**_ preestablishment importation_**, if:

      * (a) you do not *apply the thing acquired or imported for any purpose other than for a *creditable purpose relating to a *company not yet in existence; and

      * (b) the company comes into existence, and becomes *registered, within 6 months after the acquisition or importation; and

      * (c) you become a member, officer or employee of the company; and

      * (d) in the case of an acquisition--you have been fully reimbursed by the company for the *consideration you provided for the acquisition; and

      * (e) in the case of an importation--you have been fully reimbursed by the company:

        * (i) for the *assessed GST paid on the importation; and

        * (ii) for the cost of acquiring or producing the thing imported.

    * (2) However, the acquisition or importation is _not_ a **_preestablishment acquisition_** or a**_ preestablishment importation_** if:

      * (a) you are entitled to an input tax credit for the acquisition or importation; or

      * (b) the company acquires the thing acquired or imported, and that acquisition by the company is a *creditable acquisition.

##### 6020  Creditable purpose

    * (1) If, before a *company is in existence, you make an acquisition or importation:

      * (a) for the purpose of bringing the company into existence; or

      * (b) for the purpose of the company *carrying on an *enterprise after it is in existence;

    * you acquire or import the thing for a **_creditable purpose_** only to the extent that you acquire or import it for either or both of those purposes.

    * (2) However, you do not acquire or import the thing for a creditable purpose to the extent that:

      * (a) the acquisition or importation relates (directly or indirectly) to the company making supplies that would be *input taxed; or

      * (b) the acquisition or importation is of a private or domestic nature.

    * (3) An acquisition or importation is not treated, for the purposes of paragraph (2)(a), as relating to making supplies that would be *input taxed to the extent that the supply is made through an *enterprise, or a part of an enterprise, that the company will *carry on outside the indirect tax zone.

    * (4) This section has effect despite sections 1115 and 1510 (which are about creditable purpose).

##### 6025  Attributing the input tax credit for preestablishment acquisitions

    * (1) The input tax credit to which a *company is entitled under this Division for an acquisition that you made is attributable to the tax period (applying to the company) in which you were fully reimbursed by the company for the *consideration you paid for the acquisition.

    * (2) However, if the company does not hold a copy of a *tax invoice that you (or your agent) hold for the acquisition when the company gives to the Commissioner a *GST return for the tax period to which the input tax credit for the acquisition would otherwise be attributable, then:

      * (a) the input tax credit (including any part of the input tax credit) is not attributable to that tax period; and

      * (b) the input tax credit (or the part of the input tax credit) is attributable to the first tax period for which the company gives to the Commissioner a GST return at a time when it holds a copy of that tax invoice.

    * However, this subsection does not apply in circumstances of a kind determined in writing by the Commissioner, under subsection 2910(3), to be circumstances in which the requirement for a tax invoice does not apply.

          * For the giving of GST returns to the Commissioner, see Division 31.

    * (3) This section has effect despite section 2910 (which is about attributing input tax credits for acquisitions).

##### 6030  Attributing the input tax credit for preestablishment importations

    * (1) The input tax credit to which a *company is entitled under this Division for an importation that you made is attributable to the tax period (applying to the company) in which you were fully reimbursed by the company:

      * (a) for the *assessed GST paid on the importation; and

      * (b) for the cost of acquiring or producing the thing imported.

    * (2) This section has effect despite section 2915 (which is about attributing input tax credits for importations).

##### 6035  Application of Division 129

    * If a *company is entitled under this Division to an input tax credit for an acquisition or importation, the acquisition or importation is treated, for the purposes of Division 129 (which is about changes in the extent of creditable purpose), as if the company had made it.

#### Division 63--Nonprofit subentities

##### 631  What this Division is about

    * Some kinds of nonprofit entities may choose to have some (or all) of their separately identifiable branches treated as separate entities for GST purposes.

          * Note: The parent entities then cease to be responsible, for GST purposes, for these branches. (By way of contrast, parent entities would remain responsible for their branches if they registered them under Division 54.)

##### 635  Entities that may choose to apply this Division

    * (1) An entity may choose to apply this Division.

    * (2) However, the entity must be *registered and must be:

      * (a) an *endorsed charity or a *government school; or

      * (aa) a *giftdeductible entity that is a nonprofit body; or

      * (b) a nonprofit body that is exempt from income tax under any of these provisions of the *ITAA 1997:

        * (i) section 505 (charity, education and science);

        * (ii) section 5010 (community service);

        * (iii) section 5015 (employees and employers);

        * (iv) section 5040 (primary and secondary resources, and tourism);

        * (v) item 9.1 or 9.2 of section 5045 (sports, culture and recreation).

##### 6310  Period for which a choice has effect

    * (1) The choice has effect from the time the entity makes the choice.

    * (2) The choice ceases to have effect if:

      * (a) the entity revokes the choice; or

      * (b) the entity ceases to meet the requirements of subsection 635(2).

    * (3) However, the entity:

      * (a) cannot revoke the choice within 12 months after the day on which the entity made the choice; and

      * (b) cannot make a further choice within 12 months after the day on which the entity revoked a previous choice.

##### 6315  Consequences of choosing to apply this Division

    * (1) While the choice has effect, any branch of the entity is treated, for the purposes of the *GST law (other than sections 635 and 6310 and this section), as an entity if that branch:

      * (a) maintains an independent system of accounting; and

      * (b) can be separately identified by reference to:

        * (i) the nature of the activities carried on through the branch; or

        * (ii) the location of the branch; and

      * (c) is referred to in the entity's records to the effect that it is to be treated as a separate entity for the purposes of the GST law.

    * (2) The branch's treatment as an entity ceases if:

      * (a) the choice ceases to have effect; or

      *  (b) the branch ceases to meet the requirements of paragraphs (1)(a), (b) and (c).

    * However, if the branch is *registered, its treatment as an entity continues until its registration is cancelled.

    * (3) At all times during its treatment as an entity, the branch is a **_nonprofit subentity_**.

##### 6320  Nonprofit subentities may register

    * (1) A *nonprofit subentity may apply to be *registered under section 2310 even if it is not *carrying on an *enterprise and is not intending to carry on an enterprise.

    * (2) The Commissioner must *register the *nonprofit subentity whether or not the Commissioner is satisfied that it is *carrying on an *enterprise or intending to carry on an enterprise.

    * (3) This section has effect despite section 2310 (which is about who may be registered) and section 255 (which is about when the Commissioner must register an entity).

##### 6325  Registration turnover threshold for nonprofit subentities

    * (1) Subsection 2315(2) applies in relation to a *nonprofit subentity of an entity (the **_parent entity_**) whether or not the parent entity is a nonprofit body.

    * (2) Regulations made for the purposes of paragraph 2315(2)(b) may:

      * (a) provide that they apply only to *nonprofit subentities, or only to other nonprofit entities; or

      * (b) specify one amount for *nonprofit subentities and a different amount for other nonprofit entities.

##### 6327  Application of particular provisions relating to charities etc.

    * Application of particular provisions

    * (1) For the purposes of the provisions mentioned in subsection (2), a *nonprofit subentity of an entity (the **_parent entity_**) is taken to be a body of the following type, if the parent entity is a body of that type:

      * (a) a nonprofit body;

      * (b) a *giftdeductible entity;

      * (c) a *government school;

      * (d) an *endorsed charity;

      * (e) a giftdeductible entity endorsed as a deductible gift recipient (within the meaning of the *ITAA 1997) under section 30120 of the ITAA 1997;

      * (f) a fund, authority or institution of a kind referred to in paragraph 30125(1)(b) of the ITAA 1997;

      * (g) a body that has a particular *giftdeductible purpose;

      * (h) a body that operates a particular *retirement village;

      * (i) a particular *school.

    * (2) The provisions are:

      * (a) subsection 917(2) (gifts to nonprofit bodies not consideration); and

      * (b) Subdivision 38G (Activities of charities etc.); and

      * (c) Subdivision 40E (Schools tuckshops and canteens); and

      * (d) Subdivision 40F (fundraising events); and

      * (e) section 11118 (reimbursement of volunteers' expenses); and

      * (f) section 12945 (Gifts to giftdeductible entities); and

      * (g) Division 157 (Accounting basis of charities etc.).

    * (3) To avoid doubt, subsection (1) does not prevent the *nonprofit subentity being a body of a particular type merely because the parent entity is not a body of that type.

##### 6330  When nonprofit subentities must apply for cancellation of registration

    * (1) If a *nonprofit subentity is *registered and it does not meet the requirements of paragraphs 6315(1)(a), (b) and (c), it must apply to the Commissioner in the *approved form for cancellation of its *registration. It must lodge the application within 21 days after the day on which it ceased to meet those requirements.

    * (2) Section 2550 (which is about cancelling registration) does not apply to *nonprofit subentities.

##### 6335  When the Commissioner must cancel registration of nonprofit subentities

    * (1) The Commissioner must cancel *registration of a *nonprofit subentity (even if it has not applied for cancellation of the registration) if the Commissioner is satisfied that the subentity does not meet the requirements of paragraphs 6315(1)(a), (b) and (c).

          * Note: Cancelling registration under this subsection is a reviewable GST decision (see Subdivision 110F in Schedule 1 to the_ Taxation Administration Act 1953_).

    * (2) The Commissioner must notify the subentity if the Commissioner decides to cancel its registration. The notice must specify the date of effect of the cancellation.

    * (3) Subsection 2555(2) (which is about cancelling registration) does not apply to *nonprofit subentities.

##### 6340  Effect on adjustments of becoming a nonprofit subentity

    * (1) If a branch of an entity becomes a *nonprofit subentity, any *adjustment arising afterwards in relation to a supply, acquisition or importation, made by the entity through the branch before it became a nonprofit subentity:

      * (a) is taken to be an adjustment that the nonprofit subentity has, as if the nonprofit subentity had made the supply, acquisition or importation; and

      * (b) is not taken to be an adjustment that the entity has.

    * (2) For the purpose of applying subsection (1) to an adjustment under Division 129 relating to a thing acquired or imported before the branch became a *nonprofit subentity, that Division applies as if:

      * (a) the extent to which the acquisition or importation of the thing was for a *creditable purpose were the extent to which the nonprofit subentity acquired or imported it for a creditable purpose; and

      * (b) the extent to which the thing has been *applied for a creditable purpose since its acquisition or importation were the extent to which the nonprofit subentity applied it for a creditable purpose.

##### 6345  Effect on adjustments of ceasing to be a nonprofit subentity

    * (1) If a branch of an entity ceases to be a *nonprofit subentity, any *adjustment arising afterwards in relation to a supply, acquisition or importation, made by the branch while it was a nonprofit 
    * subentity, is taken to be an adjustment that the entity has, as if the entity had made the supply, acquisition or importation.


    * (2) For the purpose of applying subsection (1) to an adjustment under Division 129 relating to a thing acquired or imported before the branch ceased to be a *nonprofit subentity, that Division applies as if:

      * (a) the extent to which the acquisition or importation of the thing was for a *creditable purpose were the extent to which the entity acquired or imported it for a creditable purpose; and

      * (b) the extent to which the thing has been *applied for a creditable purpose since its acquisition or importation were the extent to which the entity applied it for a creditable purpose.

##### 6350  Membership requirements of GST groups 

    * A *nonprofit subentity **_satisfies the membership requirements_** for a *GST group, or a proposed GST group, if: 

      * (a) it is *registered; and 

      * (b) it has the same tax periods applying to it as the tax periods applying to all the other members of the GST group or proposed GST group; and 

      * (c) it accounts on the same basis as all those other members; and 

      * (d) it is not a *member of any other GST group; and 

      * (e) each of the other members of the GST group or proposed GST group is either: 

        * (i) the entity of which the nonprofit subentity is a branch; or 

        * (ii) another branch of that entity that is a nonprofit subentity. 

### Part 42--Special rules mainly about supplies and acquisitions

  * Note: The special rules in this Part mainly modify the operation of Part 22, but they may affect other Parts of Chapter 2 in minor ways.

#### Division 66--Secondhand goods

##### Table of Subdivisions

      * 66A	Input tax credits for acquiring secondhand goods

      * 66B	Acquisitions of secondhand goods that are divided for 
      * resupply


##### 661  What this Division is about

    * This Division allows you to claim input tax credits for your acquisitions of secondhand goods, even though GST was not payable on the supply of the goods to you. However, some limitations apply, and a form of global accounting is used for some acquisitions of secondhand goods that are divided for resupply.

##### Subdivision 66A--Input tax credits for acquiring secondhand goods

##### 665  Creditable acquisitions of secondhand goods

    * (1) If you acquire *secondhand goods for the purposes of sale or exchange (but not for manufacture) in the ordinary course of *business, the fact that the supply of the goods to you is not a *taxable supply does not stop the acquisition being a *creditable acquisition.

    * (2) However, this section does not apply, and is taken never to have applied, to the acquisition if:

      * (a) the supply of the goods to you was a *taxable supply, or was *GSTfree; or

      * (b) you *imported the goods; or

      * (c) the supply of the goods to you was a supply by way of hire; or

      * (d) Subdivision 66B applies to the acquisition; or

      * (e) you make a supply of the goods that is not a taxable supply.

    * (3) This section has effect despite section 115 (which is about what is a creditable acquisition).

##### 6610  Amounts of input tax credits for creditable acquisitions of secondhand goods

    * (1) The amount of the input tax credit for a *creditable acquisition of *secondhand goods for which the *consideration is more than $300 is:

      * (a) an amount equal to 1/11 of the *consideration that you provide, or are liable to provide, for the acquisition; or

      * (b) if that amount is more than the amount of the GST payable on a *taxable supply of the goods that you make--the amount of GST on that taxable supply.

    * (1A) The amount of the input tax credit for a *creditable acquisition of *secondhand goods for which the *consideration is $300 or less is an amount equal to 1/11 of the *consideration that you provide, or are liable to provide, for the acquisition.

    * (2) However, this section does not apply if the supply of the goods to you is a *taxable supply.

    * (3) This section has effect despite section 1125 (which is about the amount of input tax credits for creditable acquisitions).

##### 6615  Attributing input tax credits for creditable acquisitions of secondhand goods

    * (1) If:

      * (a) you are entitled, under this Division, to the input tax credit for a *creditable acquisition of *secondhand goods; and

      * (b) either the *consideration for the acquisition was more than $300 or you choose to have this section apply to the acquisition;

    * the input tax credit for the acquisition is attributable to: 

      * (c) the tax period in which any *consideration is received for a subsequent *taxable supply of the goods; or

      * (d) if, before any of the consideration is received, you have issued an *invoice relating to the supply--the tax period in which the invoice is issued.

    * (2) However, if you *account on a cash basis, then:

      * (a) if, in a tax period, _all_ of the *consideration is received for the subsequent *taxable supply--the input tax credit for the acquisition is attributable to that tax period; or

      * (b) if, in a tax period, _part_ of the consideration is received--the input tax credit for the acquisition is attributable to that tax period, but only to the extent that the consideration is received in that tax period; or

      * (c) if, in a tax period, _none_ of the consideration is received--none of the input tax credit for the acquisition is attributable to that tax period.

    * (4) This section has effect despite section 2910 (which is about attributing the input tax credits for creditable acquisitions).

##### 6617  Records of creditable acquisitions of secondhand goods

    * (1) If you make a *creditable acquisition of secondhand goods and the supply of the goods to you was not a *taxable supply:

      * (a) subsection 2910(3) applies to the acquisition as if references to a *tax invoice were references to a record you prepared that complies with this section; and

      * (b) subsection 2920(3) applies to an adjustment event relating to the acquisition as if references to an *adjustment note were references to a record you prepared that complies with this section.

    * (2) To comply with this section, the record must:

      * (a) set out the name and address of the entity that supplied the goods to you; and

      * (b) describe the goods (including their quantity); and

      * (c) set out the date of, and the *consideration for, the acquisition.

    * (2A) Subsection 2910(3) does not apply to a *creditable acquisition of *secondhand goods if: 

      * (a) the supply to which the acquisition relates is not a *taxable supply; and 

      * (b) the amount that would have been the *value of the supply (if it had been a *taxable supply) does not exceed $50, or such higher amount as the regulations made for the purposes of subsection 2980(1) specify. 

    * (2B) Subsection 2920(3) does not apply to a *decreasing adjustment relating to a *creditable acquisition of *secondhand goods if: 

      * (a) the supply to which the acquisition relates is not a *taxable supply; and 

      * (b) the amount of the adjustment does not exceed $50, or such higher amount as the regulations made for the purposes of subsection 2980(2) specify. 

    * (3) This section has effect despite section 2910 (which is about attributing the input tax credits for creditable acquisitions) and section 2920 (which is about attributing decreasing adjustments).

##### Subdivision 66B--Acquisitions of secondhand goods that are divided for resupply

##### 6640  Acquisitions of secondhand goods that can be used to offset GST on future resupplies

    * (1) This Subdivision applies to an acquisition of *secondhand goods if:

      * (a) you acquire the goods for the purposes of sale or exchange (but not for manufacture) in the ordinary course of *business; and

      * (b) either the *consideration for the acquisition was more than $300 or you choose to have this section apply to the acquisition; and

      * (c) the goods are of such a kind, or they are supplied to you in such a way, that it would be reasonable to expect you to divide them before supplying them in 2 or more separate supplies; and

      * (d) you do not subsequently make a single supply of the entirety of the goods acquired.

    * (2) However, this Subdivision does not apply, and is taken never to have applied, to the acquisition if:

      * (a) the *consideration for the acquisition separately itemises the consideration for the different goods acquired, and your division of the goods before supplying them:

        * (i) corresponds to that itemisation; or

        * (ii) does not involve dividing the goods any further than the division indicated by that itemisation; or

      * (b) the supply of the goods to you was a *taxable supply, or was *GSTfree; or

      * (c) you *imported the goods; or

      * (d) the supply of the goods to you was a supply by way of hire; or

      * (e) you make a supply of the goods, or of part of the goods, that is not a taxable supply (other than because of section 6645).

##### 6645  Future resupplies that are not taxable supplies

    * (1) A supply you make is not a *taxable supply if:

      * (a) it is a supply of goods that were part of an acquisition you made that was an acquisition of *secondhand goods to which this Subdivision applied; and

      * (b) your *total Subdivision 66B credit amount is more than your *total Subdivision 66B GST amount; and

      * (c) what would be the amount of GST payable on the supply, if the supply were a taxable supply, is less than or equal to the difference between:

        * (i) your *total Subdivision 66B credit amount; and

        * (ii) your *total Subdivision 66B GST amount.

          * Note: This section will not apply unless the record keeping requirements of section 6655 are met.

    * (2) This section has effect despite section 95 (which is about what are taxable supplies).

##### 6650  Future resupplies on which GST is reduced

    * (1) The amount of GST on a *taxable supply you make is reduced if:

      * (a) it is a supply of goods that were part of an acquisition you made that was an acquisition of *secondhand goods to which this Subdivision applied; and

      * (b) your *total Subdivision 66B credit amount is more than your *total Subdivision 66B GST amount; and

      * (c) what would be the amount of GST payable on the supply, if the amount were not reduced under this section, is more than the difference between:

        * (i) your total Subdivision 66B credit amount; and

        * (ii) your total Subdivision 66B GST amount.

          * Note: This section will not apply unless the record keeping requirements of section 6655 are met.

    * (2) The amount by which the GST on the supply is reduced is an amount equal to the difference between:

      * (a) your *total Subdivision 66B credit amount; and

      * (b) your *total Subdivision 66B GST amount.

    * (3) This section has effect despite section 970 (which is about the amount of GST on taxable supplies).

          * Note: Section 990 (rounding of amounts of GST) can apply to amounts of GST worked out using this section. 

##### 6655  Records of acquisitions of secondhand goods to which this Subdivision applied

    * Sections 6645 and 6650 do not apply to a supply of goods you made unless you hold a record, relating to the acquisition of *secondhand goods of which the goods supplied were a part, that:

      * (a) sets out the name and address of the entity that supplied the goods to you; and

      * (b) describes the goods (including their quantity); and

      * (c) sets out the date of, and the *consideration for, the acquisition.

##### 6660  Input tax credits for acquiring secondhand goods the supply of which is not fully taxable

    * (1) If an entity acquires *secondhand goods, and, because of section 6645 and for no other reason, the supply of the goods to the entity is not a *taxable supply:

      * (a) the fact that the supply is not a taxable supply does not stop the acquisition being a *creditable acquisition; and

      * (b) the amount of the input tax credit for the creditable acquisition is worked out as if the supply were a taxable supply.

    * (2) If:

      * (a) an entity makes a *creditable acquisition of *secondhand goods; and

      * (b) the amount of GST on the supply of the goods to the entity was reduced because of section 6650;

    * the amount of the input tax credit for the creditable acquisition is worked out as if that amount of GST had not been so reduced.

    * (3) This section has effect despite section 115 (which is about what is a creditable acquisition) and section 1125 (which is about the amount of input tax credits for creditable acquisitions).

##### 6665  Total Subdivision 66B credit amounts and Subdivision 66B GST amounts

    * (1) Your **_total Subdivision 66B credit amount_** is the sum of the amounts of the input tax credits to which you would have been entitled, for all your acquisitions of *secondhand goods to which this Subdivision applied, if this Subdivision had not applied to them.

    * (2) Your **_total Subdivision 66B GST amount_** is the sum of:

      * (a) all the amounts of GST that, but for the operation of section 6645, would have been payable on supplies that you made; and

      * (b) all the amounts by which GST payable on supplies that you made has been reduced under section 6650.

##### 6670  Commissioner may determine rules for applying this Subdivision

    * (1) The Commissioner may, in writing, determine:

      * (a) that acquisitions of *secondhand goods of a specified kind are, or are not, acquisitions of secondhand goods to which this Subdivision applies; or

      * (b) how *total Subdivision 66B credit amounts or *total Subdivision 66B GST amounts are to be worked out in specified circumstances.

    * (2) Determinations under subsection (1) override the provisions of this Subdivision (except this section), but only to the extent of any inconsistency.

#### Division 69--Nondeductible expenses

##### Table of Subdivisions

      * 69A	Nondeductible expenses generally

      * 69B	Elections for GST purposes relating to meal entertainment and entertainment facilities

##### 691  What this Division is about

    * Some expenses that are not deductible under the ITAA 1997 do not give rise to creditable acquisitions or creditable importations. The amount of input tax credits on some creditable acquisitions or creditable importations of cars is reduced.

##### Subdivision 69A--Nondeductible expenses generally

##### 695  Nondeductible expenses do not give rise to creditable acquisitions or creditable importations

    * (1) An acquisition is not a *creditable acquisition to the extent that it is a *nondeductible expense.

    * (2) An importation is not a *creditable importation to the extent that it is a *nondeductible expense.

    * (3) An acquisition or importation is a **_nondeductible expense_** if it is not deductible under Division 8 of the *ITAA 1997 because of one of the following:

      * (a) section 265 of the *ITAA 1997 (Penalties);

      * (b) section 2630 of the *ITAA 1997 (Relative's travel expenses);

      * (f) Division 32 of the *ITAA 1997 (Entertainment expenses);

      * (g) Division 34 of the *ITAA 1997 (Noncompulsory uniforms);

      * (h) section 51AK of the *ITAA 1936 (Agreements for the provision of nondeductible noncash business benefits).

    * (3A) An acquisition or importation is also a **_nondeductible expense_** to the extent that it is not deductible under Division 8 of the *ITAA 1997 because of one of the following:

      * (a) section 51AEA of the *ITAA 1936 (Meal entertainment--election to use the 50/50 split method);

      * (b) section 51AEB of the ITAA 1936 (Meal entertainment--election to use the 12 week register method);

      * (c) section 51AEC of the ITAA 1936 (Entertainment facility--election to use the 50/50 split method).

    * (4) If the entity making the acquisition or importation is an *exempt entity, the acquisition or importation is a **_nondeductible expense_** if it would have been a nondeductible expense under subsection (3) or (3A) had the entity not been an exempt entity.

    * (5) This section has effect despite sections 115 and 155 (which are about what is a creditable acquisition and what is a creditable importation).

##### 6910  Amounts of input tax credits for creditable acquisitions or creditable importations of certain cars

    * (1) If:

      * (a) you are entitled to an input tax credit for a *creditable acquisition or *creditable importation of a *car; and

      * (b) you are not, for the purposes of the _A New Tax System (Luxury Car Tax) Act 1999_, entitled to quote an *ABN in relation to the supply to which the creditable acquisition relates, or in relation to the importation, as the case requires; and

      * (c) the *GST inclusive market value of the car exceeds the *car limit for the *financial year in which you first used the car for any purpose;

    * the amount of the input tax credit on the acquisition or importation is the amount of GST payable on the supply or importation of the car up to 1/11 of that limit.

    * (2) However, if:

      * (a) the supply of the car is *GSTfree to any extent under Subdivision 38P; or

      * (b) the importation of the car is nontaxable to any extent under paragraph 1310(b) because it would have been GSTfree to any extent under Subdivision 38P if it had been a supply;

    * you are not entitled to the input tax credit for the acquisition or importation.

    * (3) If your acquisition or importation is *partly creditable, the input tax credit is reduced to the extent (expressed as a percentage) to which the acquisition or importation is made for a *creditable purpose.

    * (4) This section does not apply in relation to:

      * (a) the acquisition or importation of a *car that is not a *luxury car because of subsection 251(2) of the _A New Tax System (Luxury Car Tax) Act 1999_; or

            * Note: Emergency vehicles, cars fitted to transport disabled people, nonpassenger commercial vehicles, motor homes and campervans are not luxury cars under that subsection.

      * (b) the acquisition of a car by lease or hire.

    * (5) This section has effect despite sections 1125 and 1520 (which are about the amount of input tax credits on creditable acquisitions and creditable importations).

##### Subdivision 69B--Elections for GST purposes relating to meal entertainment and entertainment facilities

##### 6915  What this Subdivision is about

    * The GST consequences of incurring certain expenses for the provision of meal entertainment and entertainment facilities depend on elections made under fringe benefits tax law. These elections might not be made until after GST returns are due.

    * This Subdivision allows elections to be made for GST purposes so that GST returns can take into account the likely application of subsection 695(3A) to those expenses, before the fringe benefits tax elections are made.

##### 6920  Effect of elections on net amounts

    * (1) If you make an election under this Subdivision that has effect during a particular tax period, your *net amount for the tax period must be worked out on the basis of that election.

    * (2) This section has effect despite section 175 (which is about working out your net amount).

##### 6925  Election to use the 50/50 split method for meal entertainment

    * You may elect to have acquisitions or importations treated, for the purposes of this Subdivision, as *nondeductible expenses because of paragraph 695(3A)(a), to the extent that the acquisitions or importations would be nondeductible expenses because of that paragraph if:

      * (a) an election were in force under section 37AA of the _Fringe Benefits Tax Assessment Act 1986_ (but no further election were in force under section 37CA of that Act); and

      * (b) section 51AEA of the *ITAA 1936 were to apply, because of that election, to expenses relating to the acquisitions or importations.

##### 6930  Election to use the 12 week register method for meal entertainment

    * (1) You may elect to have acquisitions or importations treated, for the purposes of this Subdivision, as *nondeductible expenses because of paragraph 695(3A)(b), to the extent that the acquisitions or importations would be nondeductible expenses because of that paragraph if:

      * (a) an election were in force under section 37CA of the _Fringe Benefits Tax Assessment Act 1986_; and

      * (b) section 51AEB of the *ITAA 1936 were to apply, because of that election, to expenses relating to the acquisitions or importations.

    * (2) However, you cannot make the election unless you have a *valid meal entertainment register.

##### 6935  Election to use the 50/50 split method for entertainment facilities

    * You may elect to have acquisitions or importations treated, for the purposes of this Subdivision, as *nondeductible expenses because of paragraph 695(3A)(c), to the extent that the acquisitions or importations would be nondeductible expenses because of that paragraph if:

      * (a) an election were in force under section 152B of the _Fringe Benefits Tax Assessment Act 1986_; and

      * (b) section 51AEC of the *ITAA 1936 were to apply, because of that election, to expenses relating to the acquisitions or importations.

##### 6940  When elections take effect

    * (1) An election under this Subdivision is taken to have effect, or to have had effect, from the start of the tax period specified in the election.

    * (2) The tax period may be a future tax period or the current tax period. It cannot be a tax period that has already come to an end.

##### 6945  When elections cease to have effect

    * If a circumstance specified in the second column of the following table occurs, the election ceases to have effect from the start of the tax period specified in the third column:

##### 6950  Adjustment events relating to elections

    * (1) The following are **_adjustment events_** if they have the effect of changing the extent to which an acquisition you made is a *creditable acquisition:

      * (a) an election you make under this Subdivision ceases to have effect at a time other than the start of an *FBT year;

      * (b) an election is made under section 37AA, 37CA or 152B of the _Fringe Benefits Tax Assessment Act 1986_ for an FBT year, without one or more corresponding elections under this Subdivision having been made covering all the tax periods in that year;

      * (c) an election is not made under section 37AA, 37CA or 152B of that Act for an FBT year, but one or more corresponding elections have been made under this Subdivision covering one or more of the tax periods in that year.

    * (2) However, an *adjustment event under this section arises only in respect of a tax period in which:

      * (a) the day occurs by which you are required, under section 68 of the _Fringe Benefits Tax Assessment Act 1986_, to furnish a return to the Commissioner relating to an *FBT year; or

      * (b) if you are not required under that section to lodge a return relating to that FBT year--the day occurs by which you would have been required under that section to lodge a return relating to that FBT year, if you were required to lodge the return.

    * (3) Subdivision 19C applies to the acquisition in question as if every *adjustment event under this section that occurred during the *FBT year, and that relates to the acquisition, occurred during the tax period referred to in paragraph 1970(a).

    * (4) This table sets out when elections that you make or fail to make under section 37AA, 37CA or 152B of the _Fringe Benefits Tax Assessment Act 1986_ correspond to elections under this Subdivision:

##### 6955  Adjustment notes not required

    * Subsection 2920(3) does not apply to a *decreasing adjustment arising from an *adjustment event of a kind referred to in section 6950.

#### Division 70--Financial supplies (reduced credit acquisitions)

##### 701  What this Division is about

    * In some cases, acquisitions relating to financial supplies can attract a reduced input tax credit, even though no input tax credit could arise under the basic rules.

##### 705  Acquisitions that attract the reduced credit

    * (1) The regulations may provide that acquisitions of a specified kind that relate to making *financial supplies can give rise to an entitlement to a reduced input tax credit. These are **_reduced credit acquisitions_**.

    * (1A) However, an acquisition is not a reduced credit acquisition to the extent (if any) that, without this Division applying, an entity is entitled to an input tax credit for the acquisition. 

          * Note: Acquisitions relating to financial supplies can give rise to input tax credits: see subsections 1115(4) and (5). 

    * (2) For each kind of *reduced credit acquisition specified, the regulations must specify a percentage to which the input tax credit is reduced.

##### 7010  Extended meaning of creditable purpose

    * (1) The fact that a *reduced credit acquisition relates to making *financial supplies does not stop it being for a *creditable purpose, to the extent that it relates to making financial supplies.

    * (2) The fact that you *apply a *reduced credit acquisition in making *financial supplies does not stop it being applied for a *creditable purpose, to the extent that it relates to making financial supplies.

    * (3) This section has effect despite sections 1115 and 12950 (which are about the meaning of creditable purpose).

##### 7015  How much are the reduced input tax credits?

    * (1) The amount of an input tax credit for a *creditable acquisition of a *reduced credit acquisition is an amount equal to the GST payable on the supply of the acquisition multiplied by the percentage specified under subsection 705(2) for acquisitions of that kind.

    * (2) However, the amount of such an input tax credit is further reduced if the acquisition is only *partly creditable.

    * (3) This section has effect despite section 1125 (which is about the amount of input tax credits).

##### 7020  Extent of creditable purpose

    * (1) If:

      * (a) a *reduced credit acquisition is a *creditable acquisition; and

      * (b) it is not wholly for a *creditable purpose because of this Division;

    * it is *partly creditable.

    * (2) The extent to which the acquisition is acquired or applied for a *creditable purpose is worked out using the following formula:

    * where: 

    * **_extent of creditable purpose_** is the extent to which the purpose for which you applied or acquired the acquisition was a *creditable purpose otherwise than because of this Division, expressed as a percentage.

    * **_extent of Division 70 creditable purpose_** is the extent to which the purpose for which you applied or acquired the acquisition was a *creditable purpose because of this Division, expressed as a percentage.

    * **_percentage credit reduction_** is the reduced input tax credit percentage prescribed for the purposes of subsection 705(2) for an acquisition of that kind.

          * Note: This section affects sections 1130 and 12940. It is used even if the reduced credit acquisition is used wholly in carrying on your enterprise (unless the acquisition was wholly for a creditable purpose because of this Division, then section 7015 applies).

          * Example 1: You make a reduced credit acquisition of $110,000, wholly for the purposes of carrying on your enterprise, partly for the purpose of making financial supplies (40%) and partly for the purpose of making taxable supplies (60%). Assume the percentage credit reduction to be 50%. The extent to which you make the acquisition for a creditable purpose is:

          * Applying section 1130, your input tax credit is $8,000 (assuming you were liable for all the consideration).

          * Example 2: You subsequently apply the acquisition partly in making financial supplies (40%), partly in making taxable supplies (40%) and partly for private use (20%). The extent to which you made the acquisition for a creditable purpose is:

          * Applying Division 129, your input tax credit is reduced to $6,000, giving you an increasing adjustment of $2,000.

    * (3) The Commissioner may determine, in writing, one or more ways in which to work out, for the purpose of subsection (2), the extent to which an acquisition is for a *creditable purpose.

##### 7025   of reduced credit acquisitions (Division 132)

    * (1) If:

      * (a) you supply a *reduced credit acquisition in circumstances to which Division 132 applies; and

      * (b) you made the acquisition for a *creditable purpose because of this Division, or you applied the acquisition for a *creditable purpose because of this Division;

    * this section applies for the purposes of Division 132.

    * (2) In working out the full input tax credit in subsection 1325(2), the reference to a *creditable purpose in paragraph (a) of the definition of **_full input tax credit_** is to be read as a reference to a *creditable purpose otherwise than because of Division 70.

    * (3) In working out the adjusted input tax credit in subsection 1325(2), the extent of the *creditable purpose because of subsection 1325(4) is increased by the following extent:

    * where: 

    * **_extent of Division 70 creditable purpose_** has the same meaning as in section 7020.

    * **_percentage credit reduction_** has the same meaning as in section 7020.

#### Division 71--Fringe benefits provided by input taxed suppliers

##### 711  What this Division is about

    * Suppliers making input taxed supplies may not be entitled to input tax credits for acquisitions or importations they make to provide fringe benefits to their employees.

          * Note: Under the _Fringe Benefits Tax Assessment Act 1986_, a lower rate of fringe benefits tax is payable for providing fringe benefits without entitlement to input tax credits.

##### 715  Acquisitions by input taxed suppliers to provide fringe benefits

    * (1) An acquisition that solely or partly relates to making supplies that are *input taxed is not a *creditable acquisition if:

      * (a) the acquisition would (but for this section) be an acquisition of a kind referred to in paragraph 149A(2)(b) of the _Fringe Benefits Tax Assessment Act 1986_; and

      * (b) the acquisition specifically relates to the provision of a particular benefit (within the meaning of that Act) in respect of which *fringe benefits tax is or will be payable.

    * (2) However, this section does not apply to an acquisition if:

      * (a) the only reason it relates to making supplies that are *input taxed is because it relates to making *financial supplies; and

      * (b) you do not *exceed the financial acquisitions threshold.

    * (3) This section has effect despite section 115 (which is about what is a creditable acquisition).

##### 7110  Importations by input taxed suppliers to provide fringe benefits

    * (1) An importation that solely or partly relates to making supplies that are *input taxed is not a *creditable importation if:

      * (a) the importation would (but for this section) be an importation of a kind referred to in paragraph 149A(2)(b) of the _Fringe Benefits Tax Assessment Act 1986_; and

      * (b) the importation specifically relates to the provision of a particular benefit (within the meaning of that Act) in respect of which *fringe benefits tax is or will be payable.

    * (2) However, this section does not apply to an importation if:

      * (a) the only reason it relates to making supplies that are *input taxed is because it relates to making *financial supplies; and

      * (b) you do not *exceed the financial acquisitions threshold.

    * (3) This section has effect despite section 155 (which is about what is a creditable importation).

      * 72D	Application of this Division to certain subentities

##### 721  What this Division is about

    * This Division ensures that supplies to, and acquisitions from, your associates _without_ consideration are brought within the GST system, and that supplies to your associates for inadequate consideration are properly valued for GST purposes.

##### Subdivision 72A--Supplies without consideration

##### 725  Taxable supplies without consideration

    * (1) The fact that a supply to your *associate is without *consideration, does not stop the supply being a *taxable supply if:

      * (a) your associate is not *registered or *required to be registered; or

      * (b) your associate acquires the thing supplied otherwise than solely for a *creditable purpose.

    * (2) This section has effect despite paragraph 95(a) (which would otherwise require a taxable supply to be for consideration).

    * (3) However, this section does not apply to any supply that is constituted by an insured entity settling a claim under an *insurance policy or by an entity (other than an *operator) settling a claim under a *compulsory third party scheme.

##### 7210  The value of taxable supplies without consideration

    * (1) If a supply to your *associate without *consideration is a *taxable supply, its **_value_** is the *GST exclusive market value of the supply.

    * (2) This section has effect despite section 975 (which is about the value of taxable supplies).

##### 7215  Attributing the GST to tax periods

    * (1) The tax period to which the GST on a *taxable supply to your *associate without *consideration is attributable is the tax period in which the supply first becomes a supply that is *connected with the indirect tax zone.

    * (2) This section has effect despite section 295 (which is about attributing GST on taxable supplies).

##### 7220  Supplies and acquisitions that would otherwise be sales etc.

    * (1) If, apart from a lack of *consideration:

      * (a) a supply to your *associate from you; or

      * (b) a supply to you from your associate;

    * would be a sale or some other kind of supply, the supply is taken for the purposes of the *GST law to be a supply of that kind.

    * (2) If, apart from a lack of *consideration:

      * (a) an acquisition by your *associate from you; or

      * (b) an acquisition by you from your associate;

    * would be by sale or some other means, the acquisition is taken for the purposes of the *GST law to be an acquisition by that means.

##### 7225  Supplies that would otherwise be GSTfree, input taxed or financial supplies

    * The fact that a supply to or from your *associate is without *consideration does not stop the supply from being any of the following for the purposes of the *GST law:

      * (a) a *GSTfree supply;

      * (b) a supply that is *input taxed;

      * (c) a *financial supply.

##### Subdivision 72B--Acquisitions without consideration

##### 7240  Creditable acquisitions without consideration

    * (1) The fact that an acquisition from your *associate is without *consideration does not stop the acquisition being a *creditable acquisition if you acquire the thing supplied otherwise than solely for a *creditable purpose.

    * (2) This section has effect despite paragraph 115(c) (which would otherwise require a creditable acquisition to be for consideration).

    * (3) However, this section does not apply to any acquisition that is constituted by an insurer settling a claim under an *insurance policy or by an *operator settling a claim under a *compulsory third party scheme.

##### 7245  The amount of the input tax credit

    * (1) The amount of the input tax credit on an acquisition from your *associate that is without *consideration is as follows:

    * where: 

    * **_extent of creditable purpose_** is the extent to which the creditable acquisition is for a *creditable purpose, expressed as a percentage of the total purpose of the acquisition.

    * **_full input tax credit_** is what would have been the amount of the input tax credit for the acquisition if it had been made solely for a creditable purpose and you had provided, or had been liable to provide, all of the consideration for the acquisition.

    * (1A) However, if:

      * (a) an *annual apportionment election that you have made has effect at the end of the tax period to which the input tax credit is attributable; and

      * (b) the acquisition is not an acquisition of a kind specified in the regulations made for the purposes of paragraph 13140(1)(b);

    * the amount of the input tax credit on the acquisition is worked out under section 13140 as if you had provided, or had been liable to provide, all of the *consideration for the acquisition.

    * (2) This section has effect despite subsection 1130(3) (which is about the amount of input tax credits on partly creditable acquisitions).

##### 7250  Attributing the input tax credit to tax periods

    * (1) The tax period to which the input tax credit for a *creditable acquisition from your *associate without *consideration is attributable is the tax period in which the supply to which the acquisition relates first becomes a supply that is *connected with the indirect tax zone.

    * (2) This section has effect despite section 2910 (which is about attributing input tax credits for creditable acquisitions).

##### Subdivision 72C--Supplies for inadequate consideration

##### 7270  The value of taxable supplies for inadequate consideration

    * (1) If a supply to your *associate for *consideration that is _less_ than the *GST inclusive market value is a *taxable supply, its **_value_** is the *GST exclusive market value of the supply.

    * (2) Subsection (1) does not apply if:

      * (a) your associate is *registered or *required to be registered; and

      * (b) your associate acquires the thing supplied _solely_ for a *creditable purpose.

    * (3) This section has effect despite section 975 (which is about the value of taxable supplies).

##### Subdivision 72D--Application of this Division to certain subentities 

##### 7290  GST branches 

    * This Division applies to a *GST branch of an entity as if the GST branch were an *associate of: 

      * (a) that entity; and 

      * (b) every other GST branch of that entity; and 

      * (c) any other associate of that entity. 

##### 7292  Nonprofit subentities

    * as if the government entity were an *associate of the Commonwealth, of every other government entity of a kind referred to in paragraph (a), (b), (c) or (d) and of any other associate of the Commonwealth. 

    * (2) However, this Division does not apply to a supply or acquisition if a payment for the supply or acquisition is covered by subsection 917(3) or (4).

##### 72100   or Territory government entities

#### Division 75-- of freehold interests etc.

##### 751  What this Division is about

    * This Division allows you to use a margin scheme to bring within the GST system your taxable supplies of freehold interests in land, of stratum units and of longterm leases.

##### 755  Applying the margin scheme

    * (1) The *margin scheme applies in working out the amount of GST on a *taxable supply of *real property that you make by:

      * (a) selling a freehold interest in land; or

      * (b) selling a *stratum unit; or

      * (c) granting or selling a *longterm lease;

    * if you and the *recipient of the supply have agreed in writing that the margin scheme is to apply.

    * (1A) The agreement must be made:

      * (a) on or before the making of the supply; or

      * (b) within such further period as the Commissioner allows.

          * Note: Refusing to allow, or allowing, a further period within which to make an agreement is a reviewable GST decision (see Subdivision 110F in Schedule 1 to the _Taxation Administration Act 1953_).

    * (1B) A supply that you make to your *associate is taken for the purposes of subsection (1) to be a sale to your associate whether or not the supply is for *consideration.

    * (2) However, the *margin scheme does not apply if you acquired the entire freehold interest, *stratum unit or *longterm lease through a supply that was *ineligible for the margin scheme.

          * Note: If you acquired part of the interest, unit or lease through a supply that was ineligible for the margin scheme, you may have an increasing adjustment: see section 7522.

    * (3) A supply is **_ineligible for the margin scheme_** if:

      * (a) it is a *taxable supply on which the GST was worked out without applying the *margin scheme; or

      * (b) it is a supply of a thing you acquired by *inheriting it from a deceased person, and the deceased person had acquired all of it through a supply that was ineligible for the margin scheme; or

      * (c) it is a supply in relation to which all of the following apply:

        * (i) you were a *member of a *GST group at the time you acquired the interest, unit or lease in question;

        * (ii) the entity from whom you acquired it was a member of the GST group at that time;

        * (iii) the last supply of the interest, unit or lease by an entity who was not (at the time of that supply) a member of the GST group to an entity who was (at that time) such a member was a supply that was ineligible for the margin scheme; or

      * (d) it is a supply in relation to which both of the following apply:

        * (i) you acquired the interest, unit or lease from the *joint venture operator of a *GST joint venture at a time when you were a *participant in the joint venture;

        * (ii) the joint venture operator had acquired the interest, unit or lease through a supply that was ineligible for the margin scheme; or

      * (e) it is a supply in relation to which all of the following apply:

        * (i) you acquired the interest, unit or lease from an entity as, or as part of, a *supply of a going concern to you that was *GSTfree under Subdivision 38J;

        * (ii) the entity was *registered or *required to be registered, at the time of the acquisition;

        * (iii) the entity had acquired the entire interest, unit or lease through a taxable supply on which the GST was worked out without applying the margin scheme; or

      * (f) it is a supply in relation to which all of the following apply:

        * (i) you acquired the interest, unit or lease from an entity as, or as part of, a supply to you that was GSTfree under Subdivision 38O;

        * (ii) the entity was registered or required to be registered, at the time of the acquisition;

        * (iii) the entity had acquired the entire interest, unit or lease through a taxable supply on which the GST was worked out without applying the margin scheme; or

      * (g) it is a supply in relation to which all of the following apply:

        * (i) you acquired the interest, unit or lease from an entity who was your *associate, and who was registered or required to be registered, at the time of the acquisition;

        * (ii) the acquisition from your associate was without *consideration;

        * (iii) the supply by your associate was not a taxable supply;

        * (iv) your associate made the supply in the course or furtherance of an *enterprise that your associate *carried on;

        * (v) your associate had acquired the entire interest, unit or lease through a taxable supply on which the GST was worked out without applying the margin scheme.

    * (3A) Subparagraphs (3)(g)(iii) and (iv) do not apply if the acquisition from your *associate was not by means of a supply by your associate.

    * (4) A reference in paragraph (3)(b), (c) or (d) to a supply that was ineligible for the margin scheme is a reference to a supply:

      * (a) that was ineligible for the margin scheme because of one or more previous applications of subsection (3); or

      * (b) that would have been ineligible for the margin scheme for that reason if subsection (3) had been in force at all relevant times.

##### 7510  The amount of GST on taxable supplies

    * (1) If a *taxable supply of *real property is under the *margin scheme, the amount of GST on the supply i/11 of the *margin for the supply.

    * (2) Subject to subsection (3) and section 7511, the **_margin_** for the supply is the amount by which the *consideration for the supply exceeds the consideration for your acquisition of the interest, unit or lease in question.

    * (3) Subject to section 7511, if:

      * (a) the circumstances specified in an item in the second column of the table in this subsection apply to the supply; and

      * (b) an *approved valuation of the freehold interest, *stratum unit or *longterm lease, as at the day specified in the corresponding item in the third column of the table, has been made;

    * the **_margin_** for the supply is the amount by which the *consideration for the supply exceeds that valuation of the interest, unit or lease.

    * (3A) If:

      * (a) the circumstances specified in item 4 in the second column of the table in subsection (3) apply to the supply; and

      * (b) there are improvements on the land or premises in question on the day on which the *taxable supply takes place;

    * the valuation is to be made as if there are no improvements on the land or premises on that day.

    * (4) This section has effect despite section 970 (which is about the amount of GST on taxable supplies).

          * Note: Section 990 (rounding of amounts of GST) can apply to amounts of GST worked out using this section.

      * had not been paid in full at the time of the later supply;

    * treat the amount of the consideration as having been reduced by the amount of unpaid consideration referred to in paragraph (b).

          * Note: If you subsequently pay more of the consideration for the earlier supply, you may have a decreasing adjustment: see section 7527.

##### 7513  Working out margins to take into account supplies to associates

    * In working out the *margin for a *taxable supply of *real property you make to an entity who is your *associate at the time of the supply, treat the *consideration for the supply (whether or not the supply was for consideration) as if it were the same as the *GST inclusive market value of the interest, unit or lease at the time of the supply.

##### 7514  Consideration for acquisition of real property not to include cost of improvements etc.

    * (1) To avoid doubt, in working out the *consideration for an acquisition for the purposes of applying the *margin scheme to a *taxable supply of *real property, disregard:

      * (a) the cost or value of any other acquisitions that have been made by you, or any work that has been performed, in relation to the real property; and

      * (b) the cost or value of any other acquisitions that are intended to be made by you, or any work that is intended to be performed, in relation to the real property after its acquisition;

    * including acquisitions or work connected with bringing into existence the interest, unit or lease supplied.

    * (2) This section does not affect what constitutes *consideration for a purpose not connected with applying the *margin scheme.

##### 7515  Subdivided real property

    * (1) This section applies if you make a *taxable supply of *real property that relates only to part of the land or premises in which you acquired an interest, unit or lease.

    * (2) In applying any of sections 7510 to 7514 in working out the *margin for the *taxable supply, use only the corresponding proportion of the following (as applicable):

      * (a) the *consideration for the acquisition or supply referred to in that section of that interest, unit or lease;

      * (b) an *approved valuation of that interest, unit or lease as at the day referred to in that section;

      * (c) the *GST inclusive market value of that interest, unit or lease as at the day or time referred to in that section.

          * Example 1: If subsection 7511(2) applies, use only the corresponding proportion of an approved valuation of your interest, unit or lease in the unsubdivided property as at 1 July 2000.

          * Example 2: If subparagraph 7511(5)(e)(ii) applies, use only the corresponding proportion of the consideration for the acquisition of the interest, unit or lease in the unsubdivided property by the entity that supplied it to you.

##### 7516  Margins for supplies of real property acquired through several acquisitions

    * (1) If:

      * (a) you make a *taxable supply of *real property under the *margin scheme; and

      * (c) one of the following provisions (a **_margin provision_**) applies in relation to such a partial acquisition, or would so apply if the partial acquisition had been an acquisition of the whole of the interest, unit or lease:

        * (i) section 7510;

        * (ii) subsection 7511(1), (2), (2A), (2B), (3), (4), (5), (6) or (7);

    * the margin provision applies, in working out the margin for the supply you make, only to the extent that the supply is connected to the partial acquisition.

    * (2) The application of a margin provision in relation to one of the partial acquisitions does not prevent that margin provision or a different margin provision applying in relation to another of the partial acquisitions.

##### 7520  Supplies under a margin scheme do not give rise to creditable acquisitions

    * (1) An acquisition of a freehold interest in land, a *stratum unit or a *longterm lease is not a *creditable acquisition if the supply of the interest, unit or lease was a *taxable supply under the *margin scheme.

        * (ii) had been entitled to an input tax credit for its acquisition; and

        * (iii) was *registered or *required to be registered, at the time of your acquisition of the interest, unit or lease.

    * (5) The amount of the *increasing adjustment under subsection (3) or (4) is an amount equal to 1/11 of:

      * (a) if you choose to apply an *approved valuation to work out the amount--an approved valuation of the part of the interest, unit or lease referred to in paragraph (3)(b) or subparagraph (4)(c)(i) as at the day on which the entity had acquired it; or

      * (b) otherwise--the *consideration for the entity's acquisition of that part of the interest, unit or lease.

##### 7525  Adjustments relating to bad debts

#### Division 78--Insurance

##### 781  What this Division is about

    * Stamp duty is not included in working out the GST on insurance premiums. Insurers have decreasing adjustments which enable the net GST on insurance to reflect correctly their margins after settlements of claims are taken into account.

          * Note: Payments and supplies under compulsory third party schemes are dealt with in some cases under this Division and in others under Division 79 or 80.

##### Subdivision 78A--Insurers

##### 785  GST on insurance premiums is exclusive of stamp duty

    * (1) The *value of a *taxable supply of an *insurance policy is worked out as if the *price of the supply were reduced by the amount of any stamp duty payable under a *State law or *Territory law in respect of the supply.

    * (2) This section has effect despite section 975 (which is about the value of taxable supplies).

##### 7810  Decreasing adjustments for settlements of insurance claims

    * (1) An insurer has a **_decreasing adjustment_** if, in settlement of a claim under an *insurance policy, the insurer:

      * (a) makes a payment of *money; or

      * (b) makes a supply; or

      * (c) makes both a payment of money and a supply.

    * (2) However, this section only applies if:

      * (a) the supply of the *insurance policy by the insurer was solely or partly a *taxable supply; and

      * (b) either:

        * (i) there was no entitlement to an input tax credit for the premium paid in relation to the period during which the event giving rise to the claim happened; or

        * (ii) there was an entitlement to such an input tax credit, but the amount of the input tax credit was less than the GST payable by the insurer for the taxable supply; and

      * (c) the insurer settles the claim for a *creditable purpose; and

      * (d) the insurer is *registered, or *required to be registered; and

      * (e) the settlement does not relate solely to one or more *noncreditable insurance events.

    * (2A) In working out the amount of an input tax credit for the purposes of subparagraph (2)(b)(ii), disregard sections 13140 and 13150 (which are about amounts of input tax credits under the annual apportionment rules).

    * (3) An event is a **_noncreditable insurance event_** if the supply of an *insurance policy would not be a *taxable supply if it were only an insurance policy against loss, damage, injury or risk that relates to that event happening.

##### 7815  How to work out the decreasing adjustments

    * No input tax credit for the premium

    * (1) If there was no entitlement to an input tax credit for the premium paid in relation to the period during which the event giving rise to the claim happened, the amount of the decreasing adjustment i/11 of the *settlement amount.

    * Partial input tax credit for the premium

    * (2) If there was an entitlement to such an input tax credit, the amount of the decreasing adjustment is as follows:

    * where: 

    * **_extent of input tax credit_** is the amount of the input tax credit expressed as a fraction of the GST payable for the supply of the *insurance policy for the period to which the premium relates.

          * Note: There is no decreasing adjustment if there is a full input tax credit for the premium paid: see paragraph 7810(2)(b).

    * Noncreditable insurance events

    * (3) The amount of the decreasing adjustment under subsection (1) or (2) is reduced to the extent (if any) that the settlement relates to one or more *noncreditable insurance events.

    * Settlement amounts

    * (4) The **_settlement amount_** is worked out using this method statement.

Method statement

        * Step 1.	Add together: 

          * _	_(a)	the sum of the payments of *money (if any) made in settlement of the claim; and 

          * (b) the *GST inclusive market value of the supplies (if any) made by the insurer in settlement of the claim (other than supplies that would have been *taxable supplies but for section 7825).

        * Step 2.	If any payments of excess were made to the insurer under the *insurance policy in question, subtract from the step 1 amount the sum of all those payments (except to the extent that they are payments of excess to which section 7818 applies). 

        * Step 3.	Multiply the step 1 amount, or (if step 2 applies) the step 2 amount, by the following: 

        *  where: 

        * **_	extent of input tax credit_** has the meaning given by subsection (2).

      * (a) there is a payment of an excess to the insurer under an *insurance policy; and

#### Division 79--Compulsory third party schemes

##### 791  What this Division is about

    * Operators of compulsory third party schemes have adjustments which enable the net GST on the schemes to reflect correctly their margins after settlements of claims and other payments and supplies under the schemes are taken into account.

    * The normal application of Division 78 to some insurance policy payments and supplies under the schemes is modified (see Subdivision 79A). That Division is also extended so that it applies in a modified form to payments and supplies connected with, but not under, insurance policies (see Subdivision 79B). For other settlements, and payments, provisions similar to Division 78 apply (see Subdivision 79C). Certain adjustments are worked out using an "applicable average input tax credit fraction" (see Subdivision 79D).

          * Note: Division 80 deals with use of settlement sharing arrangements by the operators of compulsory third party schemes.

      * (d) work out the average of those fractions (the **_new fraction_**); and

      * (e) if the Minister considers the new fraction is significantly different from the average input tax credit fraction that would, disregarding this subsection, apply under subparagraph (1)(c)(i) for the scheme for the financial year (the **_operative year_**) following the determination year--in writing, determine that the new fraction is to be the average input tax credit fraction for the scheme for the operative year.

    * Business vehicle use fraction

    * (4) The business vehicle use fraction is the fraction of total vehicle use, in the State or Territory in which the *compulsory third party scheme operates, represented by business vehicle use.

    * (3) If the *contributing operator is a party to the *insurance policy settlement sharing arrangement because it issued 2 or more *insurance policies, the *contributing operator's payment is treated as a payment or supply, made by the contributing operator, in settlement of a claim relating to the accidents or incidents, under the insurance policies, and for that purpose is divided among the policies in equal proportions.

If, in relation to the *managing operator's payment or supply, any payments of an excess were made to the *managing operator, subtract from the step 1 amount the sum of all those payments (except to the extent that they are payments of excess to which section 7818 or 7955 applies).

          * Example: Assume the same facts as in the examples in sections 8020 and 8025. Assume also that, as a result of section 8020, there was a decreasing adjustment under Division 78 or 79 for the managing operator's payment or supply.

          * The managing operator has an increasing adjustment. It equals the part of the decreasing adjustment that is attributable to the managing operator's payment or supply that was repaid by the contributing operator's contribution.

    * then: 

      * (c) the transfer of anything to the enterprise in the indirect tax zone from the enterprise outside the indirect tax zone; or

      * (d) the doing of anything for the enterprise in the indirect tax zone by the enterprise outside the indirect tax zone;

    * is taken to be a supply that is not *connected with the indirect tax zone.

          * Example: An entity acquires, through a place of business it has overseas, the right to exploit a particular copyright in the indirect tax zone. That right is then transferred to a place of business that the entity has in the indirect tax zone.

          * Under this section, the transfer is taken to be a supply that is not connected with the indirect tax zone and, if the other requirements of section 845 are satisfied, the transfer is a taxable supply.

    * (2) If the transfer is a transfer of the services of an employee, this section does not apply to the transfer to the extent that any payments that:

      * (a) are made from the *enterprise in the indirect tax zone to the enterprise outside the indirect tax zone; and

      * (b) relate to the transfer;

    * would be *withholding payments if they were payments from the enterprise in the indirect tax zone to the employee.

    * (3) *Commercial residential premises are **_predominantly for longterm accommodation_** if at least 70% of the individuals who are provided with *commercial accommodation in the premises are provided with commercial accommodation as *longterm accommodation.

##### 8725  Suppliers may choose not to apply this Division

    * (1) This Division does not apply to a supply of *commercial accommodation if the supplier chooses not to apply this Division to any supplies of commercial accommodation that the supplier makes.

#### Division 96--Supplies partly connected with the indirect tax zone

##### 961  What this Division is about

    * This Division treats a supply that is partly connected with the indirect tax zone as separate supplies, so that only the part of a supply that is connected with the indirect tax zone is included in the GST system.

##### 965  Supplies that are only partly connected with the indirect tax zone

    * (1) If, because a supply (the **_actual supply_**) is a supply of more than one of these kinds:

      * (a) a supply of goods;

      * (b) a supply of *real property;

      * (c) a *telecommunication supply;

      * (d) a supply of anything, other than goods or real property, that is not a telecommunication supply;

    * only part of the actual supply is *connected with the indirect tax zone, then the actual supply is to be treated as if it were separate supplies in the following way.

    * (2) The part of the actual supply that is *connected with the indirect tax zone is to be treated as if it were a separate supply that is connected with the indirect tax zone.

    * (3) The part of the actual supply that is not *connected with the indirect tax zone is to be treated as if it were a separate supply that is not connected with the indirect tax zone.

    * (4) However, if one of the kinds of supply that forms part of the actual supply may reasonably be regarded as incidental to:

      * (a) the other kind of supply that forms part of the actual supply; or

      * (b) one (but not both) of the other kinds of supply that form part of the actual supply;

    * and its value (if it were a separate *taxable supply) would not exceed $50,000, it is treated as part of that other kind of supply.

    * (5) This section has effect despite section 925 (which is about when supplies are connected with the indirect tax zone).

##### 9610  The value of the taxable components of supplies that are only partly connected with the indirect tax zone

    * (1) If a supply (the **_actual supply_**):

      * (a) is, because of section 965, to be treated as separate supplies; and

      * (b) the part of the actual supply that is *connected with the indirect tax zone is a *taxable supply, or is partly a *taxable supply and partly a supply that is *GSTfree or *input taxed;

    * the **_value _**of that part of the actual supply is worked out as follows:

      * (c) work out the value of the actual supply, under section 975, as if it were solely a taxable supply; and

      * (d) work out the proportion of that value of the actual supply that the taxable supply represents; and

      * (e) multiply that value by the proportion in paragraph (d).

    * (2) If that part of the actual supply is partly a *taxable supply and partly a supply that is *GSTfree or *input taxed, this section does not affect the operation of section 980 in working out the value of so much of that part of the actual supply as is a taxable supply.

    * (3) This section has effect despite section 975 (which is about the value of taxable supplies).

#### Division 99--Deposits as security

##### 991  What this Division is about

    * GST does not apply to the taking of a deposit as security for the performance of an obligation (unless the deposit is forfeited or is applied as consideration). GST is not attributable prior to forfeiture.

##### 995  Giving a deposit as security does not constitute consideration

    * (1) A deposit held as security for the performance of an obligation is not treated as *consideration for a supply, unless the deposit:

      * (a) is forfeited because of a failure to perform the obligation; or

      * (b) is applied as all or part of the consideration for a supply.

    * (2) This section has effect despite section 915 (which is about consideration).

##### 9910  Attributing the GST relating to deposits that are forfeited etc.

    * (1) The GST payable by you on a *taxable supply for which the *consideration is a deposit that was held as security for the performance of an obligation is attributable to the tax period during which the deposit:

      * (a) is forfeited because of a failure to perform the obligation; or

      * (b) is applied as all or part of the consideration for a supply.

    * (2) This section has effect despite section 295 (which is about attributing GST for taxable supplies).

#### Division 100--Vouchers

##### 1001  What this Division is about

    * A supply of a voucher for supplies up to a stated monetary value is not subject to GST. GST may still be payable on the supply for which the voucher is redeemed, and there is an increasing adjustment for unredeemed vouchers.

          * Note: Vouchers that do not have a stated monetary value can be subject to GST when supplied, but the price of the voucher is excluded when working out the GST on the supply for which the voucher is redeemed (see subsection 917(1)).

##### 1005  Supplies of vouchers with a stated monetary value

    * (1) A supply of a *voucher is not a *taxable supply if:

      * (a) on redemption of the voucher, the holder of the voucher is entitled to supplies up to the *stated monetary value of the voucher; and

      * (b) the *consideration for supply of the voucher does not exceed the stated monetary value of the voucher.

    * (2) If the *consideration for supply of the voucher exceeds the *stated monetary value of the voucher, the consideration is treated (except for the purposes of this section) as if it were reduced by that monetary value.

    * (2A) The **_stated monetary value_**, in relation to a *voucher other than a *prepaid phone card or facility, means the monetary value stated on the voucher or in documents accompanying the voucher.

    * (2B) The **_stated monetary value_**, in relation to a *voucher that is a *prepaid phone card or facility, means the sum of:

      * (a) in any case--the monetary value stated on the voucher or in documents accompanying the voucher; and

      * (b) if the voucher is topped up after it is supplied--the monetary value of the topup stated on the voucher or in documents accompanying the topup.

    * However, disregard the monetary value stated on the voucher (or in documents accompanying the voucher) or topup (as the case requires), of any bonus supplies covered by the voucher or topup (as the case requires).

    * (3) This section has effect despite section 95 (which is about what are taxable supplies) and section 915 (which is about consideration).

##### 10010  Redemption of vouchers

    * (1) The act of redeeming a *voucher is not a supply.

          * Note: A supply for which the voucher is redeemed is still a supply.

    * (2) Subsection (1) has effect despite section 910 (which is about what is a supply).

    * (3) Subsection 917(1) (which is about the consideration for exercising rights or options) does not apply to a right or option that is granted by way of a *voucher if, on redemption of the voucher, the holder of the voucher is entitled to supplies up to the *stated monetary value of the voucher.

##### 10012  Consideration on redemption of vouchers

    * (1) To avoid doubt, the consideration for a *taxable supply of a thing acquired by fully redeeming a *voucher is taken to be the sum of:

      * (a) the *stated monetary value of the voucher, reduced by any amount of that value refunded to the holder of the voucher in respect of the supply; and

      * (b) any additional consideration provided for the supply.

    * (2) To avoid doubt, the consideration for a *taxable supply of a thing acquired by partly redeeming a *voucher is taken to be the sum of:

      * (a) the amount of the *stated monetary value of the voucher that the redemption represents; and

      * (b) any additional consideration provided for the supply.

    * (3) Subsections (1) and (2) have effect despite section 915 (which is about consideration).

##### 10015  Increasing adjustments for unredeemed vouchers

    * (1) You have an **_increasing adjustment_** if:

      * (a) you supplied a *voucher for *consideration; and

          * Note: This section also applies if you reimburse the recipient of certain withholding payments: see section 11120.

    * (2) The fact that the supply to you is not a *taxable supply does not stop the acquisition being a *creditable acquisition.

      * (b) the incurring of the expense is only in part related directly to his or her activities as your agent or officer, or as a partner, as the case requires;

    * the amount of the input tax credit under subsection (1) is reduced by an extent equivalent to the extent to which the incurring of the expense is not related directly to those activities.

    * (3) This section has effect despite section 1125 (which is about the amount of input tax credits for creditable acquisitions).

      * (a) the entity is:

          * Note: This subsection excludes from this section reimbursements by certain (but not all) giftdeductible entities that are only endorsed for the operation of a fund, authority or institution.

        * (ii) on behalf of an associate of an employee (whether or not you are the employee's employer) for an expense that the associate or employee incurs;

      * that constitutes an *expense payment benefit;

    * Taxable importations of goods that were exported, and then reimported, are in some cases given a lower value than would otherwise apply. The GST then applies only to the lower value, and not to the entire value, of the goods.

##### 1175  Valuation of taxable importations of goods that were exported for repair or renovation

    * (1) The **_value_** of a *taxable importation of goods that were exported from the indirect tax zone for repair or renovation, or that are part of a *batch repair process, is the sum of:

      * (a) the cost, as determined by the Chief Executive Officer of Customs, of materials, labour and other charges involved in the repair or renovation; and

      * (b) the amount paid or payable:

        * (i) for the *international transport of the goods to their *place of consignment in the indirect tax zone; and

        * (ii) to insure the goods for that transport;

      * to the extent that the amount is not already included under paragraph (a); and

      * (ba) the amount paid or payable for a supply to which item 5A in the table in subsection 38355(1) applies, to the extent that the amount:

        * (i) is not an amount, the payment of which (or the discharging of a liability to make a payment of which), because of Division 81 or regulations made under that Division, is not the provision of *consideration; and

            * Note: Division 81 excludes certain taxes, fees and charges from the provision of consideration.

        * (ii) is not already included under paragraph (a) or (b); and

      * (c) any *customs duty payable in respect of the importation of the goods.

    * (1A) If an amount to be taken into account under paragraph (1)(b) or (ba) is not an amount in Australian currency, the amount so taken into account is the equivalent in Australian currency of that amount, ascertained in the way provided in section 161J of the _Customs Act 1901_.

    * (2) Goods are part of a **_batch repair process_** if:

      * (a) they are part of a process to replace goods that were exported from the indirect tax zone for repair or renovation; and

      * (b) they are not new or upgraded versions of the exported goods; and

      * (c) they are not replacing goods that have reached the end of their effective operational life.

    * (3) This section has effect despite subsection 1320(2) (which is about the value of taxable importations).

##### 11710  Valuation of taxable importations of live animals that were exported

    * (1) If there is a *taxable importation of a live animal that was exported, and the difference between:

      * (a) what would have been the value of the importation if this section did not apply; and

      * (b) what would have been the value of a taxable importation of the animal if it had been imported immediately before the time of the exportation;

    * is greater than zero, the **_value_** of the *taxable importation is an amount equal to that difference.

    * (2) In any other case, the **_value_** of a *taxable importation of a live animal that was exported is nil.

    * (3) However, this section does not apply if the ownership of the animal when it is imported is different from its ownership when it was last exported.

    * (4) This section has effect despite subsection 1320(2) (which is about the value of taxable importations).

##### 11715  Refunds of assessed GST on certain reimportations of live animals

    * (1) If:

      * (a) you were liable to pay the *assessed GST on a *taxable importation to which section 11710 applied; and

      * (b) the importation was not a *creditable importation; and

      * (c) the circumstances specified in the regulations occur;

    * the Commissioner must, on behalf of the Commonwealth, pay to you an amount equal to the amount of the assessed GST payable on the taxable importation.

    * (2) The amount is payable within the period and in the manner specified in the regulations.

### Part 44--Special rules mainly about net amounts and adjustments

  * Note: The special rules in this Part mainly modify the operation of Part 24, but they may affect other Parts of Chapter 2 in minor ways.

#### Division 123--Simplified accounting methods for retailers and small enterprise entities

##### 1231  What this Division is about

    * The Commissioner can create simplified accounting methods that some retailers and small enterprise entities can choose to apply with a view to reducing their costs of complying with the requirements of the GST.

##### 1235  Commissioner may determine simplified accounting methods

    * (1) The Commissioner may determine in writing an arrangement (to be known as a simplified accounting method) that:

      * (a) specifies the kinds of *retailers to whom it is available and provides a method for working out *net amounts of retailers to whom the method applies; or

      * (b) specifies the kinds of *small enterprise entities to whom it is available and provides a method for working out *net amounts of small enterprise entities to whom the method applies.

    * (2) The kinds of *retailer specified under paragraph (1)(a) must all be kinds of retailers that:

      * (a) sell *food; or

      * (b) make supplies that are *GSTfree under Subdivision 38G (Noncommercial activities of charities etc.);

    * in the course or furtherance of *carrying on their *enterprise.

    * (3) The kinds of *small enterprise entities specified under paragraph (1)(b) must all be kinds of small enterprise entities that, in the course or furtherance of *carrying on their *enterprises:

      * (a) make both:

        * (i) *taxable supplies; and

        * (ii) supplies that are *GSTfree; or

      * (b) make both:

        * (i) *creditable acquisitions; and

        * (ii) acquisitions that are not creditable acquisitions because the supplies, made to the small enterprise entities, to which the acquisitions relate are GSTfree.

##### 1237  Meaning of small enterprise entity

    * (1) An entity is a **_small enterprise entity_** at a particular time if:

      * (a) the entity is a *small business entity (other than because of subsection 328110(4) of the *ITAA 1997) for the *income year in which the time occurs; or

      * (b) at that time, the entity does not carry on a business and its *GST turnover does not exceed the *small enterprise turnover threshold.

    * (2) The **_small enterprise turnover threshold_** is $2 million.

##### 12310  Choosing to apply a simplified accounting method

    * (1) You may, by notifying the Commissioner in the *approved form:

      * (a) choose to apply a *simplified accounting method if you are a *retailer of the kind to whom the method is available; or

      * (aa) choose to apply a *simplified accounting method if you are a *small enterprise entity of the kind to whom the method is available; or

      * (b) revoke your choice under paragraph (a) or (aa).

    * (2) However, you:

      * (a) cannot revoke the choice within 12 months after the day on which you made the choice; and

      * (b) cannot make a further choice as a *retailer within 12 months after the day on which you revoked a previous choice as a retailer; and

      * (ba) cannot make a further choice as a *small enterprise entity within 12 months after the day on which you revoked a previous choice as a small enterprise entity; and

      * (c) cannot choose to apply a *simplified accounting method in addition to another simplified accounting method.

    * (3) Your choice to apply a *simplified accounting method has effect from the start of the tax period specified in your notice.

    * (4) Your choice to apply a *simplified accounting method ceases to have effect:

      * (a) if you made your choice as a *retailer and cease to be a retailer of the kind to whom the method is available--from the start of the tax period occurring after the day on which you cease to be such a retailer; or

      * (aa) if you made your choice as a *small enterprise entity and cease to be a small enterprise entity of the kind to whom the method is available--from the start of the tax period occurring after the day on which you cease to be such a small enterprise entity; or

      * (b) if you revoke your choice to apply the method--from the start of the tax period specified in your notice of revocation.

##### 12315  Net amounts

    * (1) If you are a *retailer or a *small enterprise entity who has chosen to apply a *simplified accounting method, the **_net amount_** for a tax period during which the choice has effect is worked out using the method provided for by the simplified accounting method.

    * (1A) However, the *net amount worked out under subsection (1) for the tax period:

      * (a) may be increased or decreased under Subdivision 21A of the *Wine Tax Act; and

      * (b) may be increased or decreased under Subdivision 13A of the _A New Tax System (Luxury Car Tax) Act 1999_.

          * Note 1: Under Subdivision 21A of the Wine Tax Act, amounts of wine tax increase the net amount, and amounts of wine tax credits reduce the net amount.

          * Note 2: Under Subdivision 13A of the _A New Tax System (Luxury Car Tax) Act 1999_, amounts of luxury car tax increase the net amount, and luxury car tax adjustments alter the net amount.

    * (2) This section has effect despite section 175 (which is about net amounts).

#### Division 126--Gambling

##### 1261  What this Division is about

    * Gambling is dealt with under the GST by using a global accounting system that provides for an alternative way of working out your net amounts by incorporating your net profits from taxable supplies involving gambling.

##### 1265  Global accounting system for gambling supplies

    * (1) If you are liable for the GST on a *gambling supply, your **_net amount_** for the tax period to which the GST on the supply is attributable is as follows:

    * where: 

    * **_global GST amount_** is your *global GST amount for the tax period.

    * **_input tax credits_** is the sum of all of the input tax credits to which you are entitled on the *creditable acquisitions and *creditable importations that are attributable to the tax period.

          * Note: Any supplies under the global accounting system will not have attracted input tax credits.

    * **_other GST_** is the sum of all of the GST for which you are liable on the *taxable supplies that are attributable to the tax period, other than *gambling supplies.

          * For the basic rules on what is attributable to a particular period, see Division 29.

    * (2) However, the *net amount worked out under subsection (1) for the tax period:

      * (a) may be increased or decreased if you have any *adjustments for the tax period; and

      * (b) may be increased or decreased under Subdivision 21A of the *Wine Tax Act; and

      * (c) may be increased or decreased under Subdivision 13A of the _A New Tax System (Luxury Car Tax) Act 1999_.

          * Note 1: See Part 24 for the basic rules on adjustments.

          * Note 2: Under Subdivision 21A of the Wine Tax Act, amounts of wine tax increase the net amount, and amounts of wine tax credits reduce the net amount.

          * Note 3: Under Subdivision 13A of the _A New Tax System (Luxury Car Tax) Act 1999_, amounts of luxury car tax increase the net amount, and luxury car tax adjustments alter the net amount.

    * (3) This section has effect despite section 175 (which is about net amounts).

          * Note: If you are a *GST instalment payer your net amount is reduced by GST instalments you have paid: see section 162105.

##### 12610  Global GST amounts

    * (1) Your **_global GST amount_** for a tax period is as follows:

    * where: 

    * **_total amounts wagered_** is the sum of the *consideration for all of your *gambling supplies that are attributable to that tax period.

    * **_total monetary prizes_** is the sum of:

      * (a) the *monetary prizes you are liable to pay, during the tax period, on the outcome of gambling events (whether or not any of those gambling events, or the *gambling supplies to which the monetary prizes relate, take place during the tax period); and

      * (b) any amounts of *money you are liable to pay, during the tax period, under agreements between you and *recipients of your gambling supplies, to repay to them a proportion of their losses relating to those supplies (whether or not the supplies take place during the tax period).

          * For the basic rules on what is attributable to a particular period, see Division 29.

    * (2) However, your **_global GST amount_** is zero for any tax period in which total monetary prizes exceeds total amounts wagered.

    * (3) In working out the total monetary prizes for a tax period, disregard any *monetary prizes you are liable to pay, during the tax period, that relate to supplies that are *GSTfree.

    * (4) Your **_global GST amount_** for a tax period may be affected by sections 12615 and 12620.

##### 12615  Losses carried forward

    * If, for any tax period, your total monetary prizes referred to in subsection 12610(1) exceed your total amounts wagered referred to in that subsection, the amount of that excess is to be added to your total monetary prizes, referred to in that subsection, for the next tax period.

##### 12620  Bad debts

    * (1) You cannot have an *adjustment under Division 21 in relation to a *gambling supply.

    * (2) If, in a tax period, you write off as bad the whole or part of the *consideration for a *gambling supply that is due as a debt, but has not been received, the amount written off is to be added to your total monetary prizes, referred to in subsection 12610(1), for that tax period.

    * (3) However, if, in a tax period, you recover the whole or part of the amount written off, the amount recovered is to be added to your total amounts wagered, referred to in subsection 12610(1), for that tax period.

    * (4) This section has effect despite sections 215 and 2110 (which are about adjustments for writing off and recovering suppliers' bad debts).

##### 12625  Application of Subdivision 9C

    * Subdivision 9C does not apply to a *gambling supply.

##### 12630  Gambling supplies do not give rise to creditable acquisitions

    * (1) An acquisition of a thing is not a *creditable acquisition if the supply of the thing acquired was a *gambling supply.

    * (2) This section has effect despite section 115 (which is about what is a creditable acquisition).

##### 12632  Repayments of gambling losses are not consideration

    * (1) A payment of money is not the provision of *consideration to the extent that the payment:

      * (a) is made by a supplier of *gambling supplies to a *recipient of gambling supplies that the supplier makes; and

      * (b) is made, under an agreement between them, to repay to the recipient a proportion of his or her losses relating to those supplies.

    * (2) This section has effect despite section 915 (which is about what is consideration).

##### 12633  Tax invoices not required for gambling supplies

    * (1) You are not required to issue a *tax invoice for a *taxable supply that you make that is solely a *gambling supply.

    * (2) This section has effect despite section 2970 (which is about the requirement to issue tax invoices).

##### 12635  Meaning of gambling supply and gambling event 

    * (1) A **_gambling supply_** is a *taxable supply involving:

      * (a) the supply of a ticket (however described) in a lottery, raffle or similar undertaking; or

      * (b) the acceptance of a bet (however described) relating to the outcome of a *gambling event.

    * (2) A **_gambling event_** is:

      * (a) the conducting of a lottery or raffle, or similar undertaking; or

      * (b) a race, game, or sporting event, or any other event, for which there is an outcome.

#### Division 129--Changes in the extent of creditable purpose

##### Table of Subdivisions

      * 129A	General

      * 129B	Adjustment periods

      * 129C	When adjustments for acquisitions and importations arise

      * 129D	Amounts of adjustments for acquisitions and importations

      * 129E	Attributing adjustments under this Division

##### 1291  What this Division is about

    * The extent to which an acquisition or importation is for a creditable purpose affects the amount of the resulting input tax credit. When the extent of creditable purpose is changed by later events, adjustments (for the purpose of working out net amounts under Part 24) may need to be made. 

##### Subdivision 129A--General

##### 1295  Adjustments arising under this Division

    * (1) An *adjustment can arise under this Division for:

      * (a) an acquisition, even if it is not a *creditable acquisition; or

      * (b) an importation, even if it is not a *creditable importation;

    * in respect of any *adjustment period for the acquisition or importation.

    * (2) However, in determining:

      * (a) whether an adjustment under this Division arises; or

      * (b) the amount of such an *adjustment;

    * disregard any change in the extent to which the thing acquired or imported is *applied in making *financial supplies, unless you *exceed the financial acquisitions threshold.

##### 12910  Adjustments do not arise under this Division for acquisitions and importations below a certain value

    * (1) Despite section 1295, an adjustment cannot arise under this Division for an acquisition or importation that *relates to business finance, unless the acquisition or importation had a *GST exclusive value of more than $10,000.

    * (2) Despite section 1295, an adjustment cannot arise under this Division for an acquisition or importation that does not *relate to business finance, unless the acquisition or importation had a *GST exclusive value of more than $1,000.

    * (3) An acquisition or importation **_relates to business finance_** if, at the time of the acquisition or importation, it:

      * (a) related solely or partly to making *financial supplies; and

      * (b) was not solely or partly of a private or domestic nature.

##### 12915  Adjustments do not arise under this Division where there are adjustments under Division 130

    * Despite section 1295, you cannot have an adjustment under this Division for an acquisition if you have already had an *adjustment under Division 130 (goods applied solely to private or domestic use) for the acquisition.

##### Subdivision 129B--Adjustment periods

##### 12920  Adjustment periods

    * (1) An **_adjustment period_** for an acquisition or importation is a tax period applying to you that:

      * (a) starts at least 12 months after the end of the tax period to which the acquisition or importation is attributable (or would be attributable if it were a *creditable acquisition or *creditable importation); and

      * (b) ends:

        * (i) on 30 June in any year; or

        * (ii) if none of the tax periods applying to you in a particular year ends on 30 June--closer to 30 June than any of the other tax periods applying to you in that year.

    * In addition, a tax period provided for under section 2739 or 2740 or subsection 15155(1) or 16285(1) is an **_adjustment period_** for the acquisition or importation.

          * Note: Section 2739 deals with an incapacitated entity's tax periods. Section 2740 and subsections 15155(1) and 16285(1) deal with an entity's concluding tax period.

    * (2) Despite subsection (1), for an acquisition or importation that *relates to business finance:

      * (a) if the *GST exclusive value of the acquisition or importation is $50,000 or less--only the first such tax period is an **_adjustment period_**; or

      * (b) if the GST exclusive value of the acquisition or importation is more than $50,000 but less than $500,000--only the first 5 such tax periods are **_adjustment periods_**; or

      * (c) if the GST exclusive value of the acquisition or importation is $500,000 or more--only the first 10 such tax periods are **_adjustment periods_**.

    * (3) Despite subsection (1), for an acquisition or importation that does not *relate to business finance:

      * (a) if the *GST exclusive value of the acquisition or importation is $5,000 or less--only the first 2 such tax periods are **_adjustment periods_**; or

      * (b) if the GST exclusive value of the acquisition or importation is more than $5,000 but less than $500,000--only the first 5 such tax periods are **_adjustment periods_**; or

      * (c) if the GST exclusive value of the acquisition or importation is $500,000 or more--only the first 10 such tax periods are **_adjustment periods_**.

    * However, the Commissioner may, having regard to record keeping requirements for the purposes of income tax, determine in writing that a fewer number of tax periods are **_adjustment periods_** for a particular class of acquisitions or importations that do not *relate to business finance.

##### 12925  Effect on adjustment periods of things being disposed of etc.

    * (1) Despite section 12920, if:

      * (a) you dispose of a thing acquired or imported (other than in circumstances giving rise to a *decreasing adjustment under Division 132); or

      * (b) a thing acquired or imported is lost, stolen or destroyed; or

      * (c) a thing is acquired only for a particular period and that period expires;

    * the next tax period applying to you that ends: 

      * (d) on 30 June in any year; or

      * (e) if none of the tax periods applying to you in a particular year ends on 30 June--closer to 30 June than any of the other tax periods applying to you in that year;

    * is the last *adjustment period for the acquisition or importation in question.

    * (2) Despite section 12920, if:

      * (a) you dispose of a thing acquired or imported; and

      * (b) the disposal takes place in circumstances giving rise to a *decreasing adjustment under Division 132;

    * then: 

      * (c) the last *adjustment period to end before the disposal is the last adjustment period for the acquisition or importation in question; and

      * (d) if no such adjustment period ended before the disposal, there is no adjustment period for the acquisition or importation.

    * (3) This section does not apply to a disposal if this Division continues to apply to the acquisition or importation of the thing because of subsection 13817(2).

##### Subdivision 129C--When adjustments for acquisitions and importations arise

##### 12940  Working out whether you have an adjustment

    * (1) This is how to work out whether you have an *increasing adjustment or a *decreasing adjustment under this Division, for an *adjustment period, for an acquisition or importation:

Method statement

        * Step 1.	Work out the extent (if any) to which you have *applied the thing acquired or imported for a *creditable purpose during the period of time:

          * (a) starting when you acquired or imported the thing; and

          * (b) ending at the end of the *adjustment period.

        * This is the **_actual application of the thing_**.

        * Step 2.	Work out:

          * (a) if you have not previously had an *adjustment under this Division for the acquisition or importation--the extent (if any) to which you acquired or imported the thing for a *creditable purpose; or

          * (b) if you have previously had an *adjustment under this Division for the acquisition or importation--the *actual application of the thing in respect of the last adjustment.

        * This is the **_intended or former application of the thing_**.

        * Step 3.	If the *actual application of the thing is less than its *intended or former application, you have an **_increasing adjustment_**, for the *adjustment period, for the acquisition or importation.

        * Step 4.	If the *actual application of the thing is greater than its *intended or former application, you have a **_decreasing adjustment_**, for the *adjustment period, for the acquisition or importation.

        * Step 5.	If the *actual application of the thing is the same as its *intended or former application, you have neither an increasing adjustment nor a decreasing adjustment, for the *adjustment period, for the acquisition or importation.

    * (2) *Actual applications and *intended or former applications are to be expressed as percentages.

    * (3) If the thing is acquired through a *reduced credit acquisition and, at the time of the acquisition, it was wholly for a *creditable purpose because of Division 70, the extent to which it was acquired for a creditable purpose is the reduced input tax credit percentage prescribed for the purposes of subsection 705(2) for an acquisition of that kind.

##### 12945  Gifts to giftdeductible entities

    * (1) If you are or were entitled to an input tax credit for the *creditable acquisition of a thing, an *adjustment does not arise under this Subdivision merely because you supply the thing as a gift to an *endorsed charity or *giftdeductible entity.

    * (3) Subsection (1) does not apply in relation to a thing that you supply to a *giftdeductible entity endorsed as a deductible gift recipient (within the meaning of the *ITAA 1997) under section 30120 of the ITAA 1997, unless:

      * (a) the entity is:

        * (i) an *endorsed charity; or

        * (ii) a fund, authority or institution of a kind referred to in paragraph 30125(1)(b) of the ITAA 1997; or

      * (b) each purpose to which the supply relates is a *giftdeductible purpose of the entity.

          * Note: This subsection excludes from this section supplies to certain (but not all) giftdeductible entities that are only endorsed for the operation of a fund, authority or institution. However, supplies can be covered by this section if they relate to the principal purpose of the fund, authority or institution.

##### 12950  Creditable purpose

    * (1) You *apply a thing for a **_creditable purpose_** to the extent that you apply it in *carrying on your *enterprise.

    * (2) However, you do not *apply a thing for a creditable purpose to the extent that:

      * (a) the application relates to making supplies that are *input taxed; or

      * (b) the application is of a private or domestic nature.

    * (3) To the extent that an *application relates to making *financial supplies through an *enterprise, or a part of an enterprise, that you *carry on outside the indirect tax zone, the application is not, for the purposes of paragraph (2)(a), treated as one that relates to making supplies that would be *input taxed.

##### 12955  Meaning of apply

    * **_Apply_**, in relation to a thing acquired or imported, includes:

      * (a) supply the thing; and

      * (b) consume, dispose of or destroy the thing; and

      * (c) allow another entity to consume, dispose of or destroy the thing.

##### Subdivision 129D--Amounts of adjustments for acquisitions and importations

##### 12970  The amount of an increasing adjustment

    * The amount of an *increasing adjustment that you have under Step 3 of the Method statement in section 12940 for the thing acquired or imported is worked out as follows:

    * where: 

    * **_full input tax credit_** is the amount of the input tax credit to which you would have been entitled for acquiring or importing the thing for the purpose of your *enterprise if:

      * (a) the acquisition or importation had been solely for a *creditable purpose; and

      * (b) in the case where the supply to you was a *taxable supply because of section 725 or 845--the supply had been or is a *taxable supply under section 95.

##### 12975  The amount of a decreasing adjustment

    * The amount of a *decreasing adjustment that you have under Step 4 of the Method statement in section 12940 for the thing acquired or imported is worked out as follows:

    * where: 

    * **_full input tax credit_** is the amount of the input tax credit to which you would have been entitled for acquiring or importing the thing for the purpose of your *enterprise if:

      * (a) the acquisition or importation had been solely for a *creditable purpose; and

      * (b) in the case where the supply to you was a *taxable supply because of section 725 or 845--the supply had been or is a *taxable supply under section 95.

##### 12980  Effect of adjustment under certain Divisions

    * For the purpose of working out under this Subdivision the amount of an *adjustment for an acquisition, any adjustments under Division 19, 21, 133 or 134 that you have had for the acquisition are to be taken into account in working out the full input tax credit for the purpose of section 12970 or 12975.

##### Subdivision 129E--Attributing adjustments under this Division

##### 12990  Attributing your adjustments for changes in extent of creditable purpose

    * (1) An *adjustment that you have arising in respect of an *adjustment period under this Division is attributable to the tax period that is that adjustment period.

    * (2) This section has effect despite section 2920 (which is about attributing adjustments).

#### Division 130--Goods applied solely to private or domestic use

##### 1301  What this Division is about

    * You may have an increasing adjustment if you apply solely to private or domestic use goods for which you had a full input tax credit.

##### 1305  Goods applied solely to private or domestic use

    * (1) You have an **_increasing adjustment_** if:

      * (a) you made a *creditable acquisition or *creditable importation of goods; and

      * (b) the acquisition or importation was solely for a *creditable purpose; and

      * (c) you *apply the goods solely to private or domestic use.

    * (2) The amount of the increasing adjustment is an amount equal to the amount of the input tax credit to which you were entitled for the acquisition or importation, taking account of any *adjustments for the acquisition or importation.

    * (3) However, this section does not apply if you have previously had an adjustment under Division 129 for the acquisition or importation.

#### Division 131--Annual apportionment of creditable purpose

##### Table of Subdivisions

      * 131A	Electing to have annual apportionment

      * 131B	Consequences of electing to have annual apportionment

##### 1311  What this Division is about

    * In some cases, you may be able to claim a full input tax credit for acquisitions that are only partly for a creditable purpose. You will then have an increasing adjustment for a later tax period (that better matches your obligation to lodge an income tax return).

##### Subdivision 131A--Electing to have annual apportionment

##### 1315  Eligibility to make an annual apportionment election

    * (1) You are eligible to make an *annual apportionment election if:

      * (a) either:

        * (i) you are a *small business entity (other than because of subsection 328110(4) of the *ITAA 1997) for the *income year in which you make your election; or

        * (ii) you do not carry on a *business and your *GST turnover does not exceed the *annual apportionment turnover threshold; and

      * (b) you have not made any election under section 16215 to pay GST by instalments (other than such an election that is no longer in effect); and

      * (c) you have not made any *annual tax period election (other than such an election that is no longer in effect).

    * (2) The **_annual apportionment turnover threshold_** is:

      * (a) $2 million; or

      * (b) such higher amount as the regulations specify.

##### 13110  Making an annual apportionment election

    * (1) You may make an *annual apportionment election if you are eligible under section 1315.

    * (2) Your election takes effect from:

      * (a) the start of the earliest tax period for which, on the day on which you make your election, your *GST return is not yet due (taking into account any further period the Commissioner allows under paragraph 318(1)(b) or 3110(1)(b)); or

      * (b) the start of such other tax period as the Commissioner allows, in accordance with a request you make in the *approved form.

          * Note: Refusing a request to allow your election to take effect from the start of another tax period is a reviewable GST decision (see Subdivision 110F in Schedule 1 to the_ Taxation Administration Act 1953_).

##### 13115  Annual apportionment elections by representative members of GST groups

    * (1) A *representative member of a *GST group cannot make an *annual apportionment election unless each *member of the GST group is eligible under section 1315.

    * (2) If the *representative member makes such an election, or revokes such an election, each *member of the *GST group is taken to have made, or revoked, the election.

##### 13120  Duration of an annual apportionment election

    * General rule

    * (1) Your election ceases to have effect if:

      * (a) you revoke it; or

      * (b) the Commissioner disallows it under subsection (3); or

      * (c) in a case to which subparagraph 1315(1)(a)(i) applied--you are not a *small business entity of the kind referred to in that subparagraph for an *income year; or

      * (d) in a case to which subparagraph 1315(1)(a)(ii) applied--on 31 July in a *financial year, you do not satisfy the requirements of that subparagraph.

    * Revocation

    * (2) A revocation of your election is taken to have had, or has, effect at the start of the earliest tax period for which, on the day of the revocation, your *GST return is not yet due.

    * Disallowance

    * (3) The Commissioner may disallow your election if, and only if, the Commissioner is satisfied that you have failed to comply with one or more of your obligations under a *taxation law.

          * Note: Disallowing your election is a reviewable GST decision (see Subdivision 110F in Schedule 1 to the_ Taxation Administration Act 1953_).

    * (4) A disallowance of your election is taken to have had effect from the start of the tax period in which the Commissioner notifies you of the disallowance.

    * Not being a small business entity for an income year

    * (5) If paragraph (1)(c) applies, your election is taken to have ceased to have effect from the start of the tax period in which the first day of the *income year referred to in that paragraph falls.

    * Failing to satisfy the requirements of subparagraph 1315(1)(a)(ii)

    * (6) If paragraph (1)(d) applies, your election is taken to have ceased to have effect from the start of the tax period in which 31 July in the *financial year referred to in that paragraph falls.

##### Subdivision 131B--Consequences of electing to have annual apportionment

##### 13140  Input tax credits for acquisitions that are partly creditable

    * (1) The amount of the input tax credit on an acquisition that you make that is *partly creditable is an amount equal to the GST payable on the supply of the thing acquired if:

      * (a) an *annual apportionment election that you have made has effect at the end of the tax period to which the input tax credit is attributable; and

      * (b) the acquisition is not an acquisition of a kind specified in the regulations.

    * (2) However, if one or both of the following apply to the acquisition:

      * (a) the acquisition relates to making supplies that would be *input taxed;

      * (b) you provide, or are liable to provide, only part of the *consideration for the acquisition;

    * the amount of the input tax credit on the acquisition is as follows: 

    * where: 

    * **_extent of consideration_** is the extent to which you provide, or are liable to provide, the *consideration for the acquisition, expressed as a percentage of the total consideration for the acquisition.

    * **_extent of noninputtaxed purpose_** is the extent to which the acquisition does not relate to making supplies that would be *input taxed, expressed as a percentage of the total purpose of the acquisition.

    * **_full input tax credit_** is what would have been the amount of the input tax credit for the acquisition if it had been made solely for a *creditable purpose and you had provided, or had been liable to provide, all of the consideration for the acquisition.

    * (3) In determining for the purposes of subsection (2) whether, or the extent to which, an acquisition relates to making supplies that would be *input taxed, subsections 1115(3) to (5) apply in the same way that they apply for the purposes of paragraph 1115(2)(a).

    * (4) Determinations made by the Commissioner under subsection 1130(5) apply (so far as they are capable of applying) to working out the extent to which a *partly creditable acquisition does not relate to making supplies that would be *input taxed.

    * (5) This section does not apply to an input tax credit on an acquisition if the acquisition is, to any extent, a *reduced credit acquisition.

    * (6) This section has effect despite sections 1125 and 1130 (which are about amounts of input tax credits).

##### 13145  Input tax credits for importations that are partly creditable

    * (1) The amount of the input tax credit on an importation that you make that is *partly creditable is an amount equal to the GST payable on the importation if:

      * (a) an *annual apportionment election that you have made has effect at the end of the tax period to which the input tax credit is attributable; and

      * (b) the importation is not an importation of a kind specified in the regulations.

    * (2) However, if the importation relates to making supplies that would be *input taxed, the amount of the input tax credit on the importation is as follows:

    * where: 

    * **_extent of noninputtaxed purpose_** is the extent to which the importation does not relate to making supplies that would be *input taxed, expressed as a percentage of the total purpose of the importation.

    * **_full input tax credit_** is what would have been the amount of the input tax credit for the importation if it had been made solely for a *creditable purpose.

    * (3) In determining for the purposes of subsection (2) whether, or the extent to which, an importation relates to making supplies that would be *input taxed, subsections 1510(3) to (5) apply in the same way that they apply for the purposes of paragraph 1510(2)(a).

    * (4) Determinations made by the Commissioner under subsection 1525(4) apply (so far as they are capable of applying) to working out the extent to which a *partly creditable importation does not relate to making supplies that would be *input taxed.

    * (5) This section has effect despite sections 1520 and 1525 (which are about amounts of input tax credits).

##### 13150  Amounts of input tax credits for creditable acquisitions or creditable importations of certain cars

    * (1) If:

      * (a) this Division applies to working out the amount of a *creditable acquisition or *creditable importation that you made; and

      * (b) the acquisition or importation is an acquisition or importation of a *car;

    * the amount of the input tax credit on the acquisition or importation under this Division must not exceed the amount (if any) of the input tax credit worked out under section 6910.

    * (2) However, if subsection 13140(2) or 13145(2) applies to the acquisition or importation:

      * (a) take into account the operation of section 6910 in working out the full input tax credit for the purposes of that subsection; but

      * (b) disregard subsection 6910(3).

##### 13155  Increasing adjustments relating to annually apportioned acquisitions and importations

    * (1) You have an **_increasing adjustment_** if:

      * (a) an acquisition or importation that you made was *partly creditable; and

      * (b) the input tax credit on the acquisition or importation is attributable to a tax period ending in a particular *financial year; and

      * (c) the amount of the input tax credit is an amount worked out under this Division.

    * (2) The amount of the increasing adjustment is an amount equal to the difference between:

      * (a) the amount of the input tax credit worked out under this Division; and

      * (b) what would have been the amount of the input tax credit if this Division did not apply.

    * (3) In working out for the purposes of paragraph (2)(a) the amount of an input tax credit, take into account any change of circumstances that has given rise to:

      * (a) an adjustment for the acquisition under Division 19; or

      * (b) an adjustment for the acquisition under Division 21; or

      * (c) an adjustment for the acquisition under Division 134.

            * Note: Because of subsection 13610(3), the amount of the Division 21 adjustment will not be reduced under Division 136.

    * (4) In working out for the purposes of paragraph (2)(b) what would have been the amount of an input tax credit, take into account any change of circumstances that has given rise to:

      * (a) an adjustment for the acquisition under Division 19 (worked out as if this Division had not applied to working out the amount of the input tax credit); or

      * (b) an adjustment for the acquisition under Division 21; or

      * (c) an adjustment for the acquisition under Division 134.

            * Note: If this Division did not apply, the amount of the Division 21 adjustment would have been worked out under Division 136.

          * Example: While an annual apportionment election has effect, you make a partly creditable acquisition for $1,100, for which you have an input tax credit of $100. The extent of your creditable purpose i0%.

          * During later tax periods, the price increases by $110, for which you have a decreasing adjustment under Division 19 of $10, and the supplier writes off $660 as a bad debt, for which you have an increasing adjustment under Division 21 of $60 (subsection 13610(3) prevents the amount from being reduced under Division 136).

          * The amount of your increasing adjustment under this section is $45. This is the difference between the amounts under paragraphs (2)(a) and (b).

          * The paragraph (2)(a) amount (which is effectively worked out on a fully creditable basis) is:

          * The paragraph (2)(b) amount (which is based on a 10% creditable purpose) is:

##### 13160  Attributing adjustments under section 13155

    * (1) An *increasing adjustment under section 13155 is attributable to:

      * (a) the tax period worked out using the method statement; or

      * (b) such earlier tax period as you choose.

Method statement

        * Step 1.	Work out the tax period (the **_ITC tax period_**) to which the input tax credit for the acquisition or importation to which the adjustment relates is attributable.

        * Step 2.	Work out in which year of income that tax period starts.

        * Step 3.	If you are required under section 161 of the *ITAA 1936 to lodge a return in relation to that year of income, work out the last day of the period, specified in the notice published in the _Gazette_ under that section, for you to lodge as required under that section.

        * Step 4.	The *increasing adjustment is attributable to the tax period in which that last day occurs.

        * Step 5.	If step 3 does not apply, the increasing adjustment is attributable to the tax period in which occurs 31 December in the next *financial year to start after the end of the ITC tax period.

          * Note: Section 38855 in Schedule 1 to the _Taxation Administration Act 1953_ allows the Commissioner to defer the time for giving the GST return.

    * (2) Despite subsection (1), if, during (but not from the start of) the *financial year in which the ITC tax period ended, your *annual apportionment election ceases to have effect because:

      * (a) you revoke your annual apportionment election, or the Commissioner disallows your election, during that financial year; and

      * (b) the revocation or disallowance takes effect before the end of that financial year;

    * the *increasing adjustment is attributable to the tax period in which the cessation takes effect, or to such earlier tax period as you choose.

    * (3) However, the *increasing adjustment is attributable to a tax period provided under section 2739 or 2740 if that tax period ends earlier than the end of the tax period to which the increasing adjustment would, but for this subsection, be attributable under subsections (1) and (2).

    * (4) This section has effect despite section 2920 (which is about attributing your adjustments).

#### Division 132--Supplies of things acquired etc. without full input tax credits

##### 1321  What this Division is about

    * You may have a decreasing adjustment if you make a supply of something that you earlier acquired or imported, or subsequently applied, to make financial supplies or for a private or domestic purpose.

##### 1325  Decreasing adjustments for supplies of things acquired, imported or applied for a purpose that is not fully creditable

    * (1) You have a **_decreasing adjustment_** under this Division if:

      * (a) you make a *taxable supply of a thing (or a supply of a thing that would have been a taxable supply had it not been *GSTfree under Subdivision 38J); and

      * (b) the supply is a supply by way of sale; and

      * (c) your acquisition, importation or subsequent *application of the thing, related solely or partly to making *financial supplies, or was solely or partly of a private or domestic nature.

    * (2) The amount of the *decreasing adjustment is as follows:

    * where: 

    * **_adjusted input tax credit_** is:

      * (a) the amount of any input tax credit that was attributable to a tax period in respect of the acquisition or importation; minus

      * (b) the sum of:

        * (i) any *increasing adjustments, under Subdivision 19C or Division 129, that were previously attributable to a tax period in respect of the acquisition or importation; and

        * (ii) any increasing adjustment under Division 131 that has been previously, is or will be attributable to a tax period in respect of the acquisition or importation; plus

      * (c) the sum of any *decreasing adjustments, under Subdivision 19C or Division 129 or 133, that were previously attributable to a tax period in respect of the acquisition or importation.

    * **_full input tax credit_** is the amount of the input tax credit to which you would have been entitled for acquiring or importing the thing for the purpose of your *enterprise if:

      * (a) the acquisition or importation had been solely for a *creditable purpose; and

      * (b) in the case where the supply to you was a *taxable supply because of section 725 or 845--the supply had been or is a *taxable supply under section 95.

    * **_price_** is the *price of the *taxable supply.

    * (3) However, if the amount worked out under subsection (2) is greater than the difference between the full input tax credit and the adjusted input tax credit, the amount of the *decreasing adjustment is an amount equal to that difference.

    * (4) In working out the adjusted input tax credit, the acquisition, importation or *application in question is treated as having been for a *creditable purpose except to the extent *that the acquisition, importation or application:

      * (a) relates to the making of *financial supplies; or

      * (b) is of a private or domestic nature.

##### 13210  Attribution of adjustments under this Division

    * (1) A *decreasing adjustment under this Division is attributable to:

      * (a) the same tax period as the *taxable supply to which it relates; or

      * (b) if it relates to a supply that is not a taxable supply--the tax period to which the supply would be attributable if it were a taxable supply.

    * (2) This section has effect despite section 2920 (which is about attributing your adjustments).

#### Division 133--Providing additional consideration under grossup clauses

##### 1331  What this Division is about

    * You may have a decreasing adjustment for an acquisition that you made if, to take account of a GST liability that the supplier is subsequently found to have, you provide additional consideration at a time when you can no longer claim an input tax credit.

##### 1335  Decreasing adjustments for additional consideration provided under grossup clauses

    * (1) You have a **_decreasing adjustment_** if:

      * (a) you made an acquisition on the basis that:

        * (i) it was not a *creditable acquisition because the supply to which the acquisition relates was not a *taxable supply; or

        * (ii) it was *partly creditable because the supply to which the acquisition relates was only partly a taxable supply; and

      * (b) you provided *additional consideration for the acquisition in compliance with a contractual obligation that required you, or had the effect of requiring you, to provide additional consideration if:

        * (i) in a case where subparagraph (a)(i) applies--the supply was later found to be a taxable supply, or to be partly a taxable supply; or

        * (ii) in a case where subparagraph (a)(ii) applies--the supply was later found to be a taxable supply to a greater extent; and

      * (c) GST on the supply has not ceased to be payable (other than as a result of its payment); and

      * (d) at the time you provided the additional consideration, you were no longer entitled to an input tax credit for the acquisition.

          * Note: Section 935 or 9315 may provide a time limit on your entitlement to an input tax credit.

    * (2) The amount of the *decreasing adjustment is the difference between:

      * (a) what would have been the *previously attributed input tax credit amount for the acquisition if:

        * (i) the *additional consideration for the acquisition had been provided as part of the original *consideration for the acquisition; and

        * (ii) in a case where you have not held a *tax invoice for the acquisition--you held such an invoice; and

        * (iii) subsection 2910(4) did not apply in relation to the acquisition; and

      * (b) the previously attributed input tax credit amount.

    * (3) To avoid doubt, **_additional consideration_** for an acquisition includes a part of the *consideration for the acquisition that:

      * (a) relates to the amount of GST payable on the *taxable supply to which the acquisition relates; and

      * (b) at the time of the acquisition, the parties to the transaction under which the acquisition was made assumed was not payable.

##### 13310  Availability of adjustments under Division 19 for acquisitions

    * (1) If:

      * (a) you have a *decreasing adjustment under this Division for an acquisition; and

      * (b) the circumstances that gave rise to the adjustment also constitute an *adjustment event;

    * you do not have a decreasing adjustment under section 1970 for the acquisition in relation to those circumstances.

    * (2) This section has effect despite section 1970 (which is about adjustments for acquisitions arising because of adjustment events).

#### Division 134--Third party payments

##### 1341  What this Division is about

    * You may have a decreasing adjustment if you make a payment to an entity that acquires something that you had supplied to another entity. The entity receiving the payment may have an increasing adjustment.

##### 1345  Decreasing adjustments for payments made to third parties

    * (1) You have a **_decreasing adjustment_** if:

      * (a) you make a payment to an entity (the **_payee_**) that acquires a thing that you supplied to another entity (whether or not that other entity supplies the thing to the payee); and

      * (b) your supply of the thing to the other entity:

        * (i) was a *taxable supply; or

        * (ii) would have been a taxable supply but for a reason to which subsection (3) applies; and

      * (c) the payment is in one or more of the following forms:

        * (i) a payment of money;

        * (ii) an offset of an amount of money that the payee owes to you;

        * (iii) a crediting of an amount of money to an account that the payee holds; and

      * (d) the payment is made in connection with, in response to or for the inducement of the payee's acquisition of the thing; and

      * (e) the payment is not *consideration for a supply to you.

    * (1A) However, subsection (1) does not apply if:

      * (a) the supply of the thing to the payee is a *GSTfree supply, or is not *connected with the indirect tax zone; or

      * (b) the Commissioner is required to make a payment to the payee, under Division 168 (about the tourist refund scheme), related to the payee's acquisition of the thing;

    * and you know, or have reasonable grounds to suspect, that the supply of the thing to the payee is a GSTfree supply or is not connected with the indirect tax zone, or that the Commissioner is so required.

    * (2) The amount of the *decreasing adjustment is an amount equal to the difference between:

      * (a) either:

        * (i) if your supply to the other entity was a *taxable supply--the amount of GST payable on the supply; or

        * (ii) if your supply to the other entity would have been a taxable supply but for a reason to which subsection (3) applies--the amount of GST that would have been payable on the supply had it been a taxable supply;

      * taking into account any other *adjustments that arose, or would have arisen, relating to the supply; and

      * (b) the amount of GST that would have been payable, or would (but for a reason to which subsection (3) applies) have been payable, for that supply:

        * (i) if the *consideration for the supply had been reduced by the amount of your payment to the payee; and

        * (ii) taking into account any other adjustments that arose, or would have arisen, relating to the supply, as they would have been affected (if applicable) by such a reduction in the consideration.

    * (3) This subsection applies to the following reasons why your supply of the thing to the other entity was not a *taxable supply:

      * (a) you and the other entity are *members of the same *GST group;

      * (b) you and the other entity are members of the same *GST religious group;

      * (c) you are the *joint venture operator for a *GST joint venture, and the other entity is a *participant in the GST joint venture.

    * (4) However:

      * (a) paragraph (3)(a) does not apply if you and the payee are *members of the same *GST group when the payment referred to in paragraph (1)(a) is made; and

      * (b) paragraph (3)(b) does not apply if you and the payee are members of the same *GST religious group when that payment is made.

##### 13410  Increasing adjustments for payments received by third parties

    * (1) You have an **_increasing adjustment_** if:

      * (a) you receive a payment from an entity (the **_payer_**) that supplied a thing that you acquire from another entity (whether or not that other entity acquired the thing from the payer); and

      * (b) your acquisition of the thing from the other entity:

        * (i) was a *creditable acquisition; or

        * (ii) would have been a creditable acquisition but for a reason to which subsection (3) applies; and

      * (c) the payment is in one or more of the following forms:

        * (i) a payment of money;

        * (ii) an offset of an amount of money that you owe to the payer;

        * (iii) a crediting of an amount of money to an account that you hold; and

      * (d) the payment is made in connection with, in response to or for the inducement of your acquisition of the thing; and

      * (e) the payment is not *consideration for a supply you make.

    * (1A) However, subsection (1) does not apply unless the supply of the thing by the payer:

      * (a) was a *taxable supply; or

      * (b) would have been a taxable supply but for any of the following:

        * (i) the payer and the entity that acquired the thing from the payer being *members of the same *GST group;

        * (ii) the payer and the entity that acquired the thing from the payer being members of the same *GST religious group;

        * (iii) the payer being the *joint venture operator for a *GST joint venture, and the entity that acquired the thing from the payer being a *participant in the GST joint venture.

    * (2) The amount of the *increasing adjustment is an amount equal to the difference between:

      * (a) either:

        * (i) if your acquisition from the other entity was a *creditable acquisition--the amount of the input tax credit entitlement for the acquisition; or

        * (ii) if your acquisition from the other entity would have been a creditable acquisition but for a reason to which subsection (3) applies--the amount that would have been the amount of the input tax credit entitlement for the acquisition had it been a creditable acquisition;

      * taking into account any other *adjustments that arose, or would have arisen, relating to the acquisition; and

      * (b) the amount of the input tax credit to which you would have been entitled, or would (but for a reason to which subsection (3) applies) have been entitled, for that acquisition:

        * (i) if the *consideration for the acquisition had been reduced by the amount of the payer's payment to you; and

        * (ii) taking into account any other adjustments that arose, or would have arisen, relating to the acquisition, as they would have been affected (if applicable) by such a reduction in the consideration.

    * (3) This subsection applies to the following reasons why your acquisition of the thing from the other entity was not a *creditable acquisition:

      * (a) you and the other entity are *members of the same *GST group;

      * (b) you and the other entity are members of the same *GST religious group;

      * (c) you are the *joint venture operator for a *GST joint venture, and the other entity is a *participant in the GST joint venture.

    * (4) However:

      * (a) paragraph (3)(a) does not apply if you and the payer are *members of the same *GST group when the payment referred to in paragraph (1)(a) is made; and

      * (b) paragraph (3)(b) does not apply if you and the payer are members of the same *GST religious group when that payment is made.

##### 13415  Attribution of decreasing adjustments

    * (1) If:

      * (a) you have a *decreasing adjustment under section 1345; and

      * (b) you do not hold a *third party adjustment note for the adjustment when you give to the Commissioner a *GST return for the tax period to which the adjustment (or any part of the adjustment) would otherwise be attributable;

    * then: 

      * (c) the adjustment (including any part of the adjustment) is not attributable to that tax period; and

      * (d) the adjustment (or part) is attributable to the first tax period for which you give to the Commissioner a GST return at a time when you hold that third party adjustment note.

    * However, this subsection does not apply in circumstances of a kind determined by the Commissioner, by legislative instrument, to be circumstances in which the requirement for an adjustment note does not apply.

          * Note: For the giving of GST returns to the Commissioner, see Division 31.

    * (2) This section does not apply to a *decreasing adjustment of an amount that does not exceed the amount provided for under subsection 2980(2).

    * (3) This section has effect despite section 2920 (which is about attributing adjustments).

##### 13420  Third party adjustment notes

    * (1) A **_third party adjustment note_** for a *decreasing adjustment that you have under section 1345 is a document:

      * (a) that is created by you; and

      * (b) a copy of which is given, in the circumstances set out in subsection (2), to the entity that received the payment that gave rise to the adjustment; and

      * (c) that sets out your *ABN; and

      * (d) that contains such other information as the Commissioner determines in writing; and

      * (e) that is in the *approved form.

    * However, the Commissioner may treat as a third party adjustment note a particular document that is not a third party adjustment note.

    * (2) You must give the copy of the document to the entity that received the payment:

      * (a) within 28 days after the entity requests you to give the copy; or

      * (b) if you become aware of the *adjustment before the copy is requested--within 28 days, or such other number of days as the Commissioner determines under subsection (4) or (6), after becoming aware of the adjustment.

    * (3) Subsection (2) does not apply to an *adjustment of an amount that does not exceed the amount provided for under subsection 2980(2).

    * (4) The Commissioner may determine in writing that paragraph (2)(b) has effect, in relation to a particular document, as if the number of days referred to in that paragraph is the number of days specified in the determination.

    * (5) A determination made under subsection (4) is not a legislative instrument.

    * (6) The Commissioner may determine, by legislative instrument, circumstances in which paragraph (2)(b) has effect, in relation to those circumstances, as if the number of days referred to in that paragraph is the number of days specified in the determination.

    * (7) A determination made under subsection (4) has effect despite any determination made under subsection (6).

##### 13425  Adjustment events do not arise

    * To avoid doubt, a payment that gives rise to an *adjustment under this Division cannot give rise to an *adjustment event.

##### 13430  Application of sections 4855 and 4950

    * (1) For the purposes of working out whether you have an adjustment under this Division, disregard sections 4855 and 4950.

    * (2) However, this section does not affect the application of sections 4855 and 4950 for the purposes of working out the amount of an adjustment under this Division.

          * Note: Sections 4855 and 4950 require GST groups and GST religious groups to be treated as single entities for the purposes of adjustments.

#### Division 135--Supplies of going concerns

##### 1351  What this Division is about

    * The recipient of a supply of a going concern has an increasing adjustment to take into account the proportion (if any) of supplies that will be made in running the concern and that will not be taxable supplies or GSTfree supplies. Later adjustments are needed if this proportion changes over time.

##### 1355  Initial adjustments for supplies of going concerns

    * (1) You have an **_increasing adjustment_** if:

      * (a) you are the *recipient of a *supply of a going concern, or a supply that is *GSTfree under section 38480; and

      * (b) you intend that some or all of the supplies made through the *enterprise to which the supply relates will be supplies that are neither *taxable supplies nor *GSTfree supplies.

    * (2) The amount of the increasing adjustment is as follows:

    * where: 

    * **_proportion of noncreditable use_** is the proportion of all the supplies made through the *enterprise that you intend will be supplies that are neither *taxable supplies nor *GSTfree supplies, expressed as a percentage worked out on the basis of the *prices of those supplies.

    * **_supply price_** means the *price of the supply in relation to which the increasing adjustment arises.

##### 13510  Later adjustments for supplies of going concerns

    * (1) If you are the *recipient of a *supply of a going concern, or a supply that is *GSTfree under section 38480, Division 129 (which is about changes in the extent of creditable purpose) applies to that acquisition, in relation to:

      * (a) the proportion of all the supplies made through the *enterprise that you intend will be supplies that are neither *taxable supplies nor *GSTfree supplies; and

      * (b) the proportion of all the supplies made through the *enterprise that are supplies that are neither taxable supplies nor GSTfree supplies;

    * in the same way as that Division applies: 

      * (c) in relation to the extent to which you made an acquisition for a *creditable purpose; and

      * (d) in relation to the extent to which a thing acquired is *applied for a creditable purpose.

    * (2) For the purpose of applying Division 129, the proportions referred to in paragraphs (1)(a) and (b) are to be expressed as percentages worked out on the basis of the *prices of the supplies in question.

    * (3) This section applies in relation to any *supply of a going concern, or a supply that is *GSTfree under section 38480, whether or not it is a supply in respect of which you have had an *increasing adjustment under section 1355.

#### Division 136--Bad debts relating to transactions that are not taxable or creditable to the fullest extent

##### Table of Subdivisions

      * 136A	Bad debts relating to partly taxable or creditable transactions

      * 136B	Bad debts relating to transactions that are taxable or creditable at less than 1/11 of the price

##### 1361  What this Division is about

    * The amount of an adjustment that you have under Division 21 for a bad debt is reduced under this Division if the transaction to which the adjustment relates: 

      *  	was a supply that was partly taxable or an acquisition that was partly creditable; or

      *  	was fully taxable or creditable, but not to the extent of 1/11 of the price or consideration for the transaction.

##### Subdivision 136A--Bad debts relating to partly taxable or creditable transactions

##### 1365  Adjustments relating to partly taxable supplies

    * If you have an *adjustment under section 215, 2110, 13630 or 13635 in relation to a supply that was partly a *taxable supply, the amount of that adjustment is reduced to the following amount:

    * where: 

    * **_full adjustment_** is what would be the amount of the adjustment worked out under section 215, 2110, 13630 or 13635 if this section did not apply.

    * **_taxable proportion_** is the proportion of the *value of the supply (worked out as if it were solely a taxable supply) that the taxable supply represents.

          * Example: If the amount of an adjustment under section 215 would be $100 but the supply was only 80% taxable, the amount of the adjustment is $80.

##### 13610  Adjustments in relation to partly creditable acquisitions

    * (1) If you have an *adjustment under section 2115, 2120, 13640 or 13645 in relation to a *creditable acquisition that was *partly creditable, the amount of that adjustment is reduced to the following amount:

    * where: 

    * **_extent of consideration_** is the extent to which you provide, or are liable to provide, the *consideration for the acquisition, expressed as a percentage of the total consideration for the acquisition.

    * **_extent of creditable purpose_** is the extent of *creditable purpose last used to work out:

      * (a) the amount of the input tax credit for the acquisition; or

      * (b) the amount of any *adjustment under Division 129 in relation to the acquisition;

    * expressed as a percentage of the total purpose of the acquisition.

    * **_full adjustment_** is what would be the amount of the adjustment worked out under section 2115, 2120, 13640 or 13645 if this section did not apply.

    * (2) If you have an *adjustment under section 2115, 2120, 13640 or 13645 in relation to a *creditable acquisition that was a *reduced credit acquisition and that was not *partly creditable (that is, it is wholly for a *creditable purpose because of Division 70), the amount of that adjustment is reduced to the following amount:

    * where: 

    * **_extent of consideration_** is the extent to which you provide, or are liable to provide, the *consideration for the acquisition, expressed as a percentage of the total consideration for the acquisition.

    * **_percentage credit reduction_** is the reduced input tax credit percentage prescribed for the purposes of subsection 705(2) for an acquisition of that kind.

    * **_full adjustment_** is what would be the amount of the adjustment worked out under section 2115, 2120, 13640 or 13645 if this section did not apply.

    * (3) However, this section does not apply to an *adjustment that you have in relation to a *creditable acquisition if:

      * (a) the amount of the input tax credit for the acquisition is worked out under Division 131; and

      * (b) the adjustment is attributable to a tax period that is not later than the tax period to which an adjustment under section 13155 relating to the acquisition is attributable.

##### Subdivision 136B--Bad debts relating to transactions that are taxable or creditable at less than 1/11 of the price

##### 13630  Writing off bad debts (taxable supplies)

    * (1) The amount of a *decreasing adjustment that you have under section 215, relating to a *taxable supply that is *taxable at less than 1/11 of the price, is worked out under this section and not under section 215.

    * (2) This is how to work out the amount:

Method statement

        * Step 1.	Work out the amount of GST (if any) that was payable on the supply, taking into account any previous *adjustments for the supply. This amount is the **_previous GST amount_**.

        * Step 2.	Add together:

          * (a) the amount or amounts written off as bad from the debt to which the decreasing adjustment relates; and

          * (b) the amount of the debt that has been *overdue for 12 months or more (other than amounts already written off).

        * Step 3.	Subtract the step 2 amount from the *price of the supply.

        * Step 4.	Work out the amount of GST (if any), taking into account any previous *adjustments for the supply (but not adjustments relating to bad debts or debts overdue), that would be payable on the supply if the *price of the supply were the step 3 amount. This amount of GST is the **_adjusted GST amount_**.

        * Step 5.	Subtract the adjusted GST amount from the previous GST amount.

##### 13635  Recovering amounts previously written off (taxable supplies)

    * (1) The amount of an *increasing adjustment that you have under section 2110, relating to a *taxable supply that is *taxable at less than 1/11 of the price, is worked out under this section and not under section 2110.

    * (2) This is how to work out the amount:

Method statement

        * Step 1.	Work out the amount of GST (if any) that was payable on the supply, taking into account any previous *adjustments for the supply. This amount is the **_previous GST amount_**.

        * Step 2.	Add together:

          * (a) the amount or amounts previously written off as bad from the debt to which the increasing adjustment relates; and

          * (b) the amount of the debt that has been *overdue for 12 months or more (other than amounts already written off).

        * Step 3.	Subtract the step 2 amount from the *price of the supply.

        * Step 4.	Add to the step 3 amount an amount equal to the amount or amounts, written off or overdue for 12 months or more, that have been recovered.

        * Step 5.	Work out the amount of GST (if any), taking into account any previous *adjustments for the supply (but not adjustments relating to bad debts or debts overdue), that would be payable on the supply if the *price of the supply were the step 4 amount. This amount of GST is the **_adjusted GST amount_**.

        * Step 6.	Subtract the previous GST amount from the adjusted GST amount.

##### 13640  Bad debts written off (creditable acquisitions)

    * (1) The amount of an *increasing adjustment that you have under section 2115, relating to a *creditable acquisition that is *creditable at less than 1/11 of the consideration, is worked out under this section and not under section 2115.

    * (2) This is how to work out the amount:

Method statement

        * Step 1.	Work out the amount of the input tax credit (if any) to which you were entitled for the acquisition, taking into account any previous *adjustments for the acquisition. This amount is the **_previous credit amount_**.

        * Step 2.	Add together:

          * (a) the amount or amounts previously written off as bad from the debt to which the increasing adjustment relates; and

          * (b) the amount of the debt that has been *overdue for 12 months or more (other than amounts already written off).

        * Step 3.	Subtract the step 2 amount from the total amount of the *consideration that you have either provided, or are liable to provide, for the acquisition.

        * Step 4.	Work out the amount of the input tax credit (if any), taking into account any previous *adjustments for the acquisition (but not adjustments relating to bad debts or debts overdue), to which you would be entitled for the acquisition if the *consideration for the acquisition were the step 3 amount. This amount of GST is the **_adjusted credit amount_**.

        * Step 5.	Subtract the adjusted credit amount from the previous credit amount.

##### 13645  Recovering amounts previously written off (creditable acquisitions)

    * (1) The amount of a *decreasing adjustment that you have under section 2120, relating to a *creditable acquisition that is *creditable at less than 1/11 of the consideration, is worked out under this section and not under section 2120.

    * (2) This is how to work out the amount:

Method statement

        * Step 1.	Work out the amount of the input tax credit (if any) to which you were entitled for the acquisition, taking into account any previous *adjustments for the acquisition. This amount is the **_previous credit amount_**.

        * Step 2.	Add together:

          * (a) the amount or amounts previously written off as bad from the debt to which the decreasing adjustment relates; and

          * (b) the amount of the debt that has been *overdue for 12 months or more (other than amounts already written off).

        * Step 3.	Subtract the step 2 amount from the total amount of the *consideration that you have either provided, or are liable to provide, for the acquisition.

        * Step 4.	Add to the step 3 amount an amount equal to the amount or amounts, written off or overdue for 12 months or more, that you have paid.

        * Step 5.	Work out the amount of the input tax credit (if any), taking into account any previous *adjustments for the acquisition (but not adjustments relating to bad debts or debts overdue), to which you would be entitled for the acquisition if the *consideration for the acquisition were the step 4 amount. This amount of GST is the **_adjusted credit amount_**.

        * Step 6.	Subtract the previous credit amount from the adjusted credit amount.

##### 13650  Meanings of taxable at less than 1/11 of the price and creditable at less than 1/11 of the consideration

    * (1) A *taxable supply is **_taxable at less than 1/11 of the price_** if the amount of GST payable on the supply is an amount that is less than 1/11 of the *price of the supply.

    * (2) A *creditable acquisition is **_creditable at less than 1/11 of the consideration_** if the *taxable supply to which it relates is *taxable at less than 1/11 of the price.

#### Division 137--Stock on hand on becoming registered etc.

##### 1371  What this Division is about

    * If you become registered or required to be registered, you may have a decreasing adjustment for stock you have already acquired.

##### 1375  Adjustments for stock on hand on becoming registered etc.

    * (1) You have a **_decreasing adjustment_** if:

      * (a) you become *registered or *required to be registered; and

      * (b) at that time, you hold stock for the purpose of sale or exchange, or for use as raw materials, in *carrying on your *enterprise; and

      * (c) you had acquired the stock solely or partly for a *creditable purpose.

    * (2) However, this section does not apply if:

      * (a) you were entitled to an input tax credit for the acquisition; and

      * (b) you have not had a *increasing adjustment under Division 138 (cessation of registration) relating solely or partly to the stock.

    * (3) The amount of the decreasing adjustment is an amount equal to what would have been the *previously attributed input tax credit amount for the acquisition if you had been *registered at the time of the acquisition.

#### Division 138--Cessation of registration

##### 1381  What this Division is about

    * An entity whose registration has been cancelled may still have acquisitions and importations for which entitlements to input tax credits have arisen. This Division provides for an increasing adjustment to cancel those input tax credits.

##### 1385  Adjustments for cessation of registration

    * (1) You have an **_increasing adjustment_** if:

      * (a) your *registration is cancelled; and

      * (b) immediately before the cancellation takes effect, your assets include anything in respect of which you were, or are, entitled to an input tax credit.

          * Note: Increasing adjustments increase your net amounts.

    * (2) The amount of the adjustment, for each thing referred to in paragraph (1)(b), is as follows:

    * where: 

    * **_applicable value_** is:

      * (a) the *GST inclusive market value of the thing immediately before the cancellation takes effect; or

      * (b) if you were, or are, entitled to an input tax credit for acquiring the thing--the amount of the *consideration that you provided, or were liable to provide, for your acquisition of the thing, but only if the amount is less than that value; or

      * (c) if you were, or are, entitled to an input tax credit for importing the thing--the cost to you of acquiring or producing the thing (plus the *assessed GST paid on its importation), but only if the amount is less than that value.

    * (3) However, an *adjustment does not arise under this section in respect of an asset if:

      * (a) there were one or more *adjustment periods for your acquisition or importation of the asset; and

      * (b) the last of those adjustment periods has ended before the cancellation of your *registration takes effect.

##### 13810  Attributing adjustments for cessation of registration

    * (1) An *adjustment that you have under this Division is attributable to:

      * (aa) if you are an *incapacitated entity--your tax period under section 2739; or

      * (a) your concluding tax period under section 2740; or

      * (b) if, because of subsection 15155(1) or 16285(1), you do not have a concluding tax period under section 2740--the tax period to which that subsection applies.

    * (2) This section has effect despite section 2920 (which is about attributing your adjustments).

##### 13815  Ceasing to be registered--amounts not previously attributed

    * (1) The GST payable by you on a *taxable supply, the input tax credit to which you are entitled for a *creditable acquisition, or an *adjustment that you have, is attributable to a particular tax period, and no other, if:

      * (a) during the tax period, your *registration is cancelled; and

      * (b) immediately before the cancellation, you were *accounting on a cash basis; and

      * (c) the GST on the supply, the input tax credit on the acquisition, or the adjustment, was not attributable, to any extent, to a previous tax period during which you accounted on a cash basis; and

      * (d) it would have been attributable to that previous tax period had you not accounted on a cash basis during that period.

          * For accounting on a cash basis, see Subdivision 29B.

    * (2) This section has effect despite sections 295, 2910 and 2920 (which are about attributing GST on supplies, input tax credits on acquisitions, and adjustments) and any other provisions of this Chapter.

##### 13817  Situations to which this Division does not apply

    * (1) This Division does not apply to anything included in the assets of an entity whose *registration is cancelled, to the extent that the thing relates to an *enterprise that the entity *carried on before the cancellation, if:

      * (a) the cancellation arises as a result of the death of the entity, and the executor or trustee of the deceased estate:

        * (i) is registered or is *required to be registered; and

        * (ii) continues, immediately after the cancellation, to carry on that enterprise; or

      * (b) the cancellation arises as a result of the executor or trustee of a deceased estate ceasing to carry on any enterprise, and one or more beneficiaries of the deceased estate:

        * (i) are registered or is *required to be registered; and

        * (ii) continue, immediately after the cancellation, to carry on the enterprise that the deceased had carried on.

    * (2) Division 129 (which is about changes in the extent of creditable purpose) continues to apply to the acquisition or importation of the thing immediately after the cancellation if:

      * (a) Subdivision 129A does not prevent an adjustment arising under that Division for the acquisition or importation; and

      * (b) the cancellation occurs during an *adjustment period for the acquisition or importation.

    * (3) For the purposes of applying Division 129 to the acquisition or importation after the cancellation:

      * (a) the entity *carrying on the *enterprise in question immediately after the cancellation is taken to have made the acquisition or importation at the time it was originally made; and

      * (b) the extent (if any) to which the thing was originally acquired or imported for a *creditable purpose is taken to be the extent (if any) to which the entity acquired or imported the thing for a creditable purpose; and

      * (c) any *application of the thing since the original acquisition or importation is taken to be an application of the thing by the entity.

##### 13820  Application of Division 129

    * This Division (except subsections 13817(2) and (3)) does not affect the operation of Division 129 (which is about changes in the extent of creditable purpose).

#### Division 139--Distributions from deceased estates

##### 1391  What this Division is about

    * Distributions from deceased estates, for private consumption, that are not taxable supplies may involve disposing of assets that were acquired or imported in circumstances giving rise to entitlements to input tax credits. This Division provides for an increasing adjustment to cancel those input tax credits.

##### 1395  Adjustments for distributions from deceased estates

    * (1) You have an **_increasing adjustment_** if:

      * (a) you are the executor or trustee of a deceased estate; and

      * (b) you are *registered or *required to be registered; and

      * (c) you supply an asset of the deceased estate to a beneficiary of the deceased estate; and

      * (d) the supply is not a *taxable supply and is not a supply that is *GSTfree or *input taxed; and

      * (e) you were, or are, or the deceased person was, entitled to an input tax credit for the deceased person's acquisition or importation of the asset.

          * Note: Increasing adjustments increase your net amounts.

    * (2) The amount of the adjustment, for the asset, is as follows:

    * where: 

    * **_applicable value_** is:

      * (a) the *GST inclusive market value of the asset immediately before it is supplied; or

      * (b) if you were, or are, or the deceased person was, entitled to an input tax credit for the deceased person acquiring the thing--the amount of the *consideration that you or the deceased person provided, or was liable to provide, for the acquisition of the thing, but only if the amount is less than that value; or

      * (c) if you were, or are, or the deceased person was, entitled to an input tax credit for the deceased person importing the thing--the cost to you or the deceased person of acquiring or producing the thing (plus the *assessed GST paid on its importation), but only if the amount is less than that value.

    * (3) However, an *adjustment does not arise under this section in respect of the asset if:

      * (a) the asset related to an *enterprise that the deceased person *carried on, and the beneficiary intends to continue to carry on that enterprise; or

      * (b) there were one or more *adjustment periods for the deceased person's acquisition or importation of the asset, and the last of those adjustment periods has ended before the cancellation of your *registration takes effect.

##### 13910  Attributing adjustments for distributions from deceased estates

    * (1) An *adjustment that you have under this Division is attributable to the tax period in which it arises.

    * (2) This section has effect despite section 2920 (which is about attributing your adjustments).

##### 13915  Application of Division 129

    * This Division does not affect the operation of Division 129 (which is about changes in the extent of creditable purpose).

#### Division 141--Tradex scheme goods

##### 1411  What this Division is about

    * The holder of a tradex order has an increasing adjustment if goods relating to that order are dealt with contrary to the Tradex Scheme.

          * Note: GST would not have been payable on importation of the goods under the Tradex Scheme: see section 425.

##### 1415  Adjustments for applying goods contrary to the Tradex Scheme

    * (1) You have an **_increasing adjustment_** if:

      * (a) you import *tradex scheme goods; and

      * (b) you are the holder (within the meaning of the _Tradex Scheme Act 1999_) of the *tradex order relating to the goods; and

      * (c) the importation would have been a *taxable importation if the goods had not been covered by item 21A of Schedule 4 to the _Customs Tariff Act 1995_ at the time of their entry for home consumption under the _Customs Act 1901_; and

      * (d) any of the circumstances referred to in subsection 21(1) of that Act occur in respect of any of the goods.

    * However, the increasing adjustment only arises in relation to the first occurrence of such a circumstance following an importation of the goods.

    * (2) The amount of the *increasing adjustment is the difference between:

      * (a) the amount of GST that would have been payable on the importation if the importation had been a *taxable importation; and

      * (b) the amount (if any) of the input tax credit to which you would have been entitled for the importation if the importation had been a taxable importation.

##### 14110  Meaning of tradex scheme goods etc.

    * (1) **_Tradex scheme goods_** are imported goods that:

      * (a) are nominated goods (within the meaning of the _Tradex Scheme Act 1999_) in relation to a *tradex order; and

      * (b) were covered by item 21A in Schedule 4 to the _Customs Tariff Act 1995_ at the time of their entry for home consumption under the _Customs Act 1901_.

    * (2) **_Tradex order_** has the meaning given by section 4 of the _Tradex Scheme Act 1999_.

##### 14115  Attribution of adjustments under this Division

    * (1) An adjustment under this Division is attributable to the tax period in which the adjustment arises.

    * (2) This section has effect despite section 2920 (which is about attributing your adjustments).

##### 14120  Application of Division 129

    * This Division does not affect the operation of Division 129 (which is about changes in the extent of creditable purpose).

#### Division 142--Excess GST

##### Table of Subdivisions

      * 142A	Excess GST unrelated to adjustments

      * 142B	GST related to cancelled supplies

      * 142C	Passedon GST

##### 1421  What this Division is about

    * Excess GST is not to be refunded if this would give an entity a windfall gain_._

          * _Note:	Refunding excess GST to a supplier will give it a windfall gain if it has already passed on the excess GST in the price of the supply (and not reimbursed the recipient).

##### Subdivision 142A--Excess GST unrelated to adjustments

##### 1425  When this Subdivision applies

    * (1) This Subdivision applies if, after disregarding any amounts covered by subsection (2), your *assessed net amount for a tax period takes into account an amount of GST exceeding that which is payable.

          * Note: This Subdivision applies whether or not you have paid, or been refunded, the assessed net amount.

          * Example: Sunny Co mistakenly reports a negative net amount of $4,000 made up of GST of $10,000 less input tax credits of $14,000. In fact, Sunny Co's GST should have been $8,000 making its negative net amount $6,000. Sunny Co has excess GST of $2,000.

    * (2) Disregard the following amounts:

      * (a) an amount of GST that was correctly payable and attributable to the tax period, but which later becomes the subject of a *decreasing adjustment;

      * (b) an amount of GST that is payable, but is correctly attributable to a different tax period.

##### 14210  Refunding the excess GST

    * For the purposes of each *taxation law, so much of the excess from subsection 1425(1) (the **_excess GST_**) as you have *passed on to another entity is taken to have always been:

      * (a) payable; and

      * (b) on a *taxable supply;

    * until you reimburse the other entity for the passedon GST.

          * Note 1: If you reimburse the passedon GST so that this section ceases to apply there will be an adjustment event under paragraph 1910(1)(b) or (c). You will have a decreasing adjustment (see section 1955) and the other entity may have an increasing adjustment (see section 1980).

          * Note 2: Any excess GST you have not passed on will be refunded as described in section 15575 in Schedule 1 to the _Taxation Administration Act 1953_.

          * Note 3: While this section applies, paragraph 115(b) (about taxable supplies) is satisfied for the corresponding acquisition by the other entity.

##### 14215  When section 14210 does not apply

    * Commissioner satisfied it is inappropriate for that section to apply

    * (1) Treat section 14210 as never having applied to the extent that the Commissioner is satisfied that:

      * (a) applying that section would be inconsistent with the principle that excess GST is not to be refunded if this would give an entity a windfall gain; and

      * (b) you have requested a decision under this subsection in the *approved form.

          * Note: Refusing to make the requested decision is a reviewable GST decision (see Subdivision 110F in Schedule 1 to the _Taxation Administration Act 1953_).

    * (2) The Commissioner must notify you in writing of any decision relating to you made under subsection (1).

    * If there never was a supply

    * (3) Treat section 14210 as never having applied to the extent that:

      * (a) you treated the excess GST as payable on a supply, but in fact there never was a supply; and

      * (b) you reimburse the other entity for the *passedon GST.

          * Note: If you reimburse the passedon GST, you will be refunded an equivalent amount as described in section 15575 in Schedule 1 to the _Taxation Administration Act 1953_.

    * So far as it relates to your creditable acquisitions

    * (4) Section 14210 does not apply for the purposes of applying subsection 1115(2) (about creditable purpose) to you.

    * If the recipient knows you have not paid the excess GST

    * (5) Section 14210 does not apply for the purposes of applying a *taxation law to the other entity if, and while, that other entity knows, or could reasonably be expected to have known, that you have not paid the excess GST to the Commissioner.

          * Note: Section 14210 still applies for the purposes of applying taxation laws to you.

##### Subdivision 142B--GST related to cancelled supplies

##### 14220  Refunding GST relating to cancelled supplies

    * (1) This section applies if:

      * (a) your *assessed net amount for a tax period takes into account an amount of GST on a supply; and

      * (b) you have a *decreasing adjustment attributable to a later tax period as a result of the cancellation of the supply.

    * (2) Reduce:

      * (a) your *decreasing adjustment; and

      * (b) if the *recipient of the supply has a corresponding *increasing adjustment--the recipient's increasing adjustment;

    * to the extent that you have *passed on that GST to the recipient, but not reimbursed the recipient for the passedon GST.

    * (3) This section has effect despite sections 1955 (about decreasing adjustments for supplies) and 1980 (about increasing adjustments for acquisitions).

##### Subdivision 142C--Passedon GST

##### 14225  Working out if GST has been passed on

    * (1) Some or all of an amount of GST may have been **_passed on_** to another entity even if:

      * (a) a *tax invoice is not issued to or by that other entity; or

      * (b) a tax invoice issued to or by that other entity relates to that GST, but does not contain enough information to enable that GST to be clearly ascertained.

    * (2) If:

      * (a) you issue a *tax invoice to another entity, or another entity issues a *recipient created tax invoice to you; and

      * (b) the invoice contains enough information to enable some or all of an amount of GST to be clearly ascertained; and

      * (c) in a case where you must pay the *assessed net amount for a tax period to which the invoice relates--you have paid that assessed net amount to the Commissioner;

    * the invoice is prima facie evidence of that part of that GST having *passed on to that other entity.

    * (2) For the purposes of subsections 255(1) and (3), the Commissioner is to treat the government entity as an entity.

    * (3) The Commissioner must *register the government entity whether or not the Commissioner is satisfied that it is *carrying on an *enterprise or intending to carry on an enterprise.

    * (4) This section has effect despite section 2310 (which is about who may be registered) and modifies the effect of section 255 (which is about when the Commissioner must register an entity).

##### 14910  Government entities are not required to be registered

    * (1) A *government entity is not *required to be registered even if:

      * (a) it is *carrying on an *enterprise; and

##### 14920  Government entities not required to cancel their registration

    * Section 2550 and subsection 2555(2) (which are about cancelling registration) do not apply to *government entities.

##### 14925  Membership requirements of a government GST group

    * A *government related entity **_satisfies the membership requirements_** for a *GST group, or a proposed GST group, of government related entities if:

      * (a) it is *registered; and

      * (b) it is not a *member of any other GST group; and

      * (c) it has the same tax periods applying to it as the tax periods applying to all the other members of the GST group or proposed GST group; and

      * (d) it accounts on the same basis as all those other members; and

      * 151B	Consequences of electing to have annual tax periods

##### 1511  What this Division is about

    * In some cases, you may elect to have annual tax periods. You will then lodge GST returns, and pay amounts of GST or receive refunds of GST, on an annual basis (which better matches your obligation to lodge an income tax return).

##### Subdivision 151A--Electing to have annual tax periods

##### 1515  Eligibility to make an annual tax period election

    * (1) You are eligible to make an *annual tax period election if:

      * (a) you are not *required to be registered; and

      * (b) you have not made any election under section 16215 to pay GST by instalments (other than such an election that is no longer in effect).

    * (2) However, you are not eligible to make an *annual tax period election if the only reason you are not *required to be registered is because you disregarded supplies under paragraph 18815(3)(b) or (c) or 18820(3)(b) or (c) (which are about supplies of rights or options offshore).

##### 15110  Making an annual tax period election

    * (1) You may, by notifying the Commissioner in the *approved form, make an *annual tax period election if you are eligible under section 1515.

    * (2) Your election takes effect from:

      * (a) the start of the earliest tax period for which, on the day on which you make your election, your *GST return is not yet due (taking into account any further period the Commissioner allows under paragraph 318(1)(b) or 3110(1)(b)); or

      * (b) the start of such other tax period as the Commissioner allows, in accordance with a request you make in the *approved form.

          * Note: Refusing a request to allow your election to take effect from the start of another tax period is a reviewable GST decision (see Subdivision 110F in Schedule 1 to the_ Taxation Administration Act 1953_).

##### 15115  Annual tax period elections by representative members of GST groups

    * (1) A *representative member of a *GST group cannot make an *annual tax period election unless each *member of the GST group is eligible under section 1515.

    * (2) However:

      * (a) if:

        * (i) during the *financial year but after 28 October in that financial year, you became eligible under section 1515 to make an *annual tax period election; and

        * (ii) this subsection had not applied to you before; and

        * (iii) your *current GST lodgment record is not more than 6 months; or

      * (b) if the financial year started on 1 July 2004 and the Commissioner determines in writing that this paragraph applies;

    * you must make your election on or before the first day, after becoming eligible under section 1515 or after the Commissioner's determination, on which you would, but for this Division, be required to give a *GST return to the Commissioner.

    * (3) The Commissioner may, in accordance with a request you make in the *approved form, allow you to make your election on a specified day occurring after the day provided for under subsection (1) or (2).

          * Note: Refusing a request to be allowed to make an election on a specified day under this subsection is a reviewable GST decision (see Subdivision 110F in Schedule 1 to the _Taxation Administration Act 1953_).

##### 15125  Duration of an annual tax period election

    * Disallowance

    * (3) The Commissioner may disallow your election if, and only if, the Commissioner is satisfied that you have failed to comply with one or more of your obligations under a *taxation law.

          * Note: Disallowing your election is a reviewable GST decision (see Subdivision 110F in Schedule 1 to the_ Taxation Administration Act 1953_).

    * (4) A disallowance of your election is taken to have had effect:

      * (a) if the Commissioner notifies you of the disallowance during the *financial year in which your election first took effect--from the start of the tax period in which it first took effect; or

      * (b) if the Commissioner notifies you of the disallowance on or before 28 October during a later financial year--from the start of that later financial year; or

##### Subdivision 151B--Consequences of electing to have annual tax periods

##### 15140  Annual tax periods

    * (1) While an *annual tax period election that you have made has effect, each *financial year is a tax period that applies to you.

    * (2) However, if your *annual tax period election takes effect on a day that is not the start of a *financial year, the period from when your annual tax period election takes effect until the end of the financial year in which it takes effect is a tax period that applies to you.

    * (3) A tax period under this section is an **_annual tax period_**.

    * (4) This section has effect despite sections 275, 2710 and 2730 (which are about tax periods).

##### 15145  When GST returns for annual tax periods must be given

      * (b) if paragraph (a) does not apply--on or before the 28 February following the end of the annual tax period.

          * Note: Section 38855 in Schedule 1 to the _Taxation Administration Act 1953_ allows the Commissioner to defer the time for giving the GST return.

    * (2) This section has effect despite sections 318 and 3110 (which are about when GST returns must be given).

##### 15150  When payments of assessed net amounts for annual tax periods must be made

    * (1) If the *assessed net amount for an *annual tax period applying to you is greater than zero, you must pay the assessed net amount to the Commissioner on or before the day on which, under section 15145, you are required to give to the Commissioner your *GST return for the annual tax period.

    * during an *annual tax period applying to the entity, the annual tax period is not affected by the death, cessation or cancellation.

    * (2) This section has effect despite section 2740 (which is about an entity's concluding tax period).

    * (3) However, this section does not affect the application of:

      * (a) section 2739; or

      * (b) if an entity for any reason ceases to exist--section 2740.

##### 15160  The effect of incapacitation or cessation

##### Table of Subdivisions

      * 153A	General

      * 153B	Principals and intermediaries as separate suppliers or acquirers

##### 1531  What this Division is about

    * This Division sets out the rules for holding and issuing tax invoices and adjustment notes when your supplies or acquisitions are made through an agent, or when insurance is supplied through an insurance broker. It also allows in some cases a supply or acquisition made through, or facilitated by, an entity on your behalf to be treated as 2 separate supplies or acquisitions.

##### Subdivision 153A--General

##### 1535  Attributing the input tax credits for your creditable acquisitions

    * (1) If:

      * (a) you are entitled to the input tax credit for a *creditable acquisition made through an agent; and

      * (b) neither you nor your agent holds a *tax invoice for the acquisition when you give to the Commissioner a *GST return for the tax period to which the input tax credit on the acquisition would otherwise be attributable;

    * then: 

      * (c) the input tax credit (including any part of the input tax credit) is not attributable to that tax period; and

      * (d) the input tax credit (or the part of the input tax credit) is attributable to the first tax period for which you give to the Commissioner a GST return at a time when you or your agent holds that tax invoice.

    * (2) This section has effect despite subsection 2910(3) (which is about the requirement to hold a tax invoice).

##### 15310  Attributing your adjustments

    * (1) If:

      * (a) you have a *decreasing adjustment relating to a supply made by you through an agent or made to you through an agent; and

      * (b) neither you nor your agent holds an *adjustment note or *third party adjustment note for the adjustment when you give to the Commissioner a *GST return for the tax period to which the adjustment would otherwise be attributable;

    * then: 

      * (c) the adjustment (including any part of the adjustment) is not attributable to that tax period; and

      * (d) the adjustment (or the part of the adjustment) is attributable to the first tax period for which you give to the Commissioner a GST return at a time when you or your agent holds that adjustment note or third party adjustment note.

    * (2) This section has effect despite subsections 2920(3) (which is about the requirement to hold an adjustment note) and 13415(1) (which is about the requirement to hold a third party adjustment note).

##### 15315  Tax invoices

    * (1) If you make a *taxable supply through an agent, an obligation to issue a *tax invoice relating to the supply:

      * (a) arises whether the *recipient makes a request for a tax invoice to you _or_ the agent; and

      * (b) is complied with if either you _or_ the agent gives the recipient a tax invoice within 28 days after the request.

    * (2) However, you and the agent must not _both_ issue separate *tax invoices relating to the supply.

          * Note: If Subdivision 153B is to apply to the supply, there will be an arrangement under which only your agent can issue the tax invoice: see paragraph 15350(1)(d).

    * (3) This section has effect despite section 2970 (which is about tax invoices).

##### 15320  Adjustment notes

    * (1) If you have a *decreasing adjustment relating to a supply made by you through an agent or made to you through an agent, an obligation under subsection 2975(2) to issue an *adjustment note for the adjustment, or an obligation under subsection 13420(2) to issue a *third party adjustment note for the adjustment:

      * (a) arises whether the *recipient makes a request for an adjustment note or a third party adjustment note to you _or_ the agent; and

      * (b) is complied with if either you _or_ your agent gives the recipient an adjustment note or a third party adjustment note within 28 days after the request.

    * (2) However, you and the agent must not _both_ issue separate *adjustment notes or *third party adjustment notes for the adjustment.

    * (3) This section has effect despite sections 2975 (which is about adjustment notes) and 13420 (which is about third party adjustment notes).

##### 15325  Insurance supplied through insurance brokers

    * (2) This section does not affect the application of this Subdivision in relation to the acquisition of the *insurance policy through the insurance broker as an agent of the *recipient.

##### Subdivision 153B--Principals and intermediaries as separate suppliers or acquirers

##### 15350  Arrangements under which intermediaries are treated as suppliers or acquirers

    * (1) An entity (the **_principal_**) may, in writing, enter into an arrangement with another entity (the **_intermediary_**) under which: 

      * (a) the intermediary will, on the principal's behalf, do any or all of the following:

        * (i) make supplies to third parties;

        * (ii) facilitate supplies to third parties (including by issuing *invoices relating to, or receiving *consideration for, such supplies);

        * (iii) make acquisitions from third parties;

        * (iv) facilitate acquisitions from third parties (including by providing consideration for such acquisitions); and

      * (b) the kinds of supplies or acquisitions, or the kinds of supplies and acquisitions, to which the arrangement applies are specified; and 

      * (c) for the purposes of the GST law: 

        * (i) the intermediary will be treated as making the supplies to the third parties, or acquisitions from the third parties, or both; and 

        * (ii) the principal will be treated as making corresponding supplies to the intermediary, or corresponding acquisitions from the intermediary, or both; and 

      * (d) in the case of supplies to third parties: 

        * (i) the intermediary will issue to the third parties, in the intermediary's own name, all the *tax invoices and *adjustment notes relating to those supplies; and 

        * (ii) the principal will not issue to the third parties any tax invoices and adjustment notes relating to those supplies; and 

      * (e) the arrangement ceases to have effect if the principal or the intermediary, or both of them, cease to be *registered. 

    * (2) For the purposes of subsection (1), an entity can be an intermediary whether or not the entity is the agent of the principal.

##### 15355  The effect of these arrangements on supplies 

    * (1) A *taxable supply that the principal makes to a third party through the intermediary is taken to be a supply that is a taxable supply made by the intermediary to the third party, and not by the principal, if: 

      * (a) the supply is of a kind to which the arrangement applies; and 

      * (b) the supply is made in accordance with the arrangement; and 

      * (c) both the principal and the intermediary are *registered. 

    * (2) In addition, the principal is taken to make a supply that is a *taxable supply to the intermediary. This supply is taken: 

      * (a) to be a supply of the same thing as is supplied in the taxable supply (the **_intermediary's supply_**) that the intermediary is taken to make; and 

      * (b) to have a *value equal to 10/11 of the amount that is payable to the principal by the intermediary in respect of the intermediary's supply. 

    * The intermediary is taken to make a corresponding *creditable acquisition from the principal. 

    * (3) If the principal pays, or is liable to pay, an amount, as a commission or similar payment, to the intermediary for the intermediary's supply to the third party: 

      * (a) for the purpose of paragraph (2)(b), the amount payable by the intermediary to the principal is taken to be reduced by the amount the principal pays, or is liable to pay, to the intermediary; and 

      * (b) the supply by the intermediary to the principal, to which the principal's payment or liability relates, is not a *taxable supply. 

    * (4) However, this section no longer applies, and is taken never to have applied, if the principal issues to the third party, in the principal's own name, any *tax invoice or *adjustment note relating to the supply. 

    * (5) This section has effect despite section 95 (which is about what are taxable supplies), section 975 (which is about the value of taxable supplies) and section 115 (which is about what are creditable acquisitions). 

##### 15360  The effect of these arrangements on acquisitions 

    * (1) An acquisition that the principal makes from a third party through the intermediary is taken to be a *creditable acquisition made by the intermediary from the third party, and not by the principal, if: 

      * (a) the acquisition is of a kind to which the arrangement applies; and 

      * (b) the acquisition is made in accordance with the arrangement; and 

      * (c) both the principal and the intermediary are *registered. 

    * (2) In addition, the intermediary is taken to make a supply that is a *taxable supply to the principal. This supply is taken: 

      * (a) to be a supply of the same thing as is acquired in the *creditable acquisition (the **_intermediary's acquisition_**) that the intermediary is taken to make; and 

      * (b) to have a *value equal to 10/11 of the amount that is payable to the intermediary by the principal in respect of the intermediary's acquisition. 

    * The principal is taken to make a corresponding acquisition from the intermediary, and the acquisition is taken to be a creditable acquisition if, apart from this section, the principal's acquisition from the third party would have been a creditable acquisition. 

    * (3) If the principal pays, or is liable to pay, an amount, as a commission or similar payment, to the intermediary for the intermediary's acquisition from the third party: 

      * (a) for the purpose of paragraph (2)(b), the amount payable by the principal to the intermediary is taken to be increased by the amount the principal pays, or is liable to pay, to the intermediary; and 

      * (b) the supply by the intermediary to the principal, to which the principal's payment or liability relates, is not a *taxable supply. 

    * (4) This section has effect despite section 115 (which is about what are creditable acquisitions), section 1110 (which is about what are acquisitions), section 95 (which is about what are taxable supplies) and section 975 (which is about the value of taxable supplies). 

##### 15365  Determinations that supplies or acquisitions are taken to be under these arrangements 

    * (1) The Commissioner may determine in writing that:

      * (a) supplies of a specified kind to third parties that any entity (the **_intermediary_**) makes or facilitates (including by issuing *invoices relating to, or receiving *consideration for, such supplies) on behalf of any other entity (the **_principal_**); or

      * (b) acquisitions of a specified kind from third parties that any entity (the **_intermediary_**) makes or facilitates (including by providing consideration for such acquisitions) on behalf of any other entity (the **_principal_**);

    * are taken to be supplies or acquisitions that are of a kind to which an arrangement of a kind referred to in section 15350 applies, and that are made in accordance with that arrangement.

    * (2) The determination has effect accordingly, unless either the intermediary or the principal notifies the other in writing, or both notify each other in writing, that: 

      * (a) any supplies to third parties that the intermediary makes or facilitates (including by issuing *invoices relating to, or receiving *consideration for, such supplies) on the principal's behalf are not supplies to which such an arrangement applies; and 

      * (b) any acquisitions from third parties that the intermediary makes or facilitates (including by providing consideration for such acquisitions) on the principal's behalf are not acquisitions to which such an arrangement applies. 

#### Division 156--Supplies and acquisitions made on a progressive or periodic basis

##### 1561  What this Division is about

    * Supplies and acquisitions made for a period or on a progressive basis are treated as separate supplies or acquisitions for some purposes, in particular the attribution rules.

##### 1565  Attributing the GST on progressive or periodic supplies

    * (1) The GST payable by you on a *taxable supply that is made:

      * (a) for a period or on a progressive basis; and

      * (b) for *consideration that is to be provided on a progressive or periodic basis;

    * is attributable, in accordance with section 295, as if each progressive or periodic component of the supply were a separate supply.

    * (2) If the progressive or periodic components of such a supply are not readily identifiable, the components correspond to the proportion of the total *consideration for the supply that the separate amounts of consideration represent.

##### 15610  Attributing the input tax credits on progressive or periodic acquisitions

    * (1) The input tax credit to which you are entitled for a *creditable acquisition that is made:

      * (a) for a period or on a progressive basis; and

      * (b) for *consideration that is to be provided on a progressive or periodic basis;

    * is attributable, in accordance with section 2910, as if each progressive or periodic component of the acquisition were a separate acquisition.

    * (2) If the progressive or periodic components of such an acquisition are not readily identifiable, the components correspond to the proportion of the total *consideration for the acquisition that the separate amounts of consideration represent.

##### 15615  Progressive or periodic supplies partly connected with the indirect tax zone

    * (1) If:

      * (a) a *taxable supply is made for a period or on a progressive basis; and

      * (b) the supply is made for *consideration that is to be provided on a progressive or periodic basis; and

      * (c) the whole of a progressive or periodic component of the supply would not be *connected with the indirect tax zone if it were a separate supply;

    * that component is treated as if it were a separate supply that is not connected with the indirect tax zone.

    * (2) This section has effect despite section 925 (which is about when supplies are connected with the indirect tax zone) and Division 96.

##### 15617  Application of Division 58 to progressive or periodic supplies and acquisitions

    * (1) A supply that is made:

      * (a) for a period or on a progressive basis; and

      * (b) for *consideration that is to be provided on a progressive or periodic basis;

    * is treated, for the purposes of Division 58 (which is about representatives of incapacitated entities), as if each progressive or periodic component of the supply were a separate supply.

    * (2) An acquisition that is made:

      * (a) for a period or on a progressive basis; and

      * (b) for *consideration that is to be provided on a progressive or periodic basis;

    * is treated, for the purposes of Division 58 (which is about representatives of incapacitated entities), as if each progressive or periodic component of the acquisition were a separate acquisition.

##### 15620  Application of Division 129 to progressive or periodic acquisitions

    * An acquisition that is made: 

      * (a) for a period or on a progressive basis; and

      * (b) for *consideration that is to be provided on a progressive or periodic basis;

    * is treated, for the purposes of Division 129 (which is about changes in the extent of creditable purpose), as if each progressive or periodic component of the acquisition were a separate acquisition.

##### 15622  Leases etc. treated as being on a progressive or periodic basis

    * For the purposes of this Division, a supply or acquisition by way of lease, hire or similar arrangement is to be treated as a supply or acquisition that is made on a progressive or periodic basis, for the period of the lease, hire or arrangement.

##### 15623  Certain supplies or acquisitions under hire purchase agreements treated as not on progressive or periodic basis

    * For the purposes of this Division, a supply or acquisition of goods or credit under a *hire purchase agreement is treated as not being a supply or acquisition made on a progressive or periodic basis.

##### 15625  Accounting on a cash basis

    * This Division (other than sections 15615 and 15617) does not apply if you *account on a cash basis.

#### Division 157--Accounting basis of charities etc.

##### 1571  What this Division is about

    * The choice available to an endorsed charity, giftdeductible entity or government school to account on a cash basis is not restricted as it is for other entities, but other restrictions may apply.

##### 1575  Charities etc. choosing to account on a cash basis

    * (1) An *endorsed charity, a *giftdeductible entity or a *government school may choose to *account on a cash basis, with effect from the first day of the tax period that the endorsed charity or entity chooses.

    * (3) This section does not apply in relation to a *giftdeductible entity endorsed as a deductible gift recipient (within the meaning of the *ITAA 1997) under section 30120 of the ITAA 1997, unless the entity is:

      * (a) an *endorsed charity; or

      * (b) a *government school; or

      * (c) a fund, authority or institution of a kind referred to in paragraph 30125(1)(b) of the ITAA 1997.

          * Note: This subsection excludes from this section certain (but not all) giftdeductible entities that are only endorsed for the operation of a fund, authority or institution.

    * (4) This section has effect despite section 2940 (which is about choosing to account on a cash basis).

##### 15710  Charities etc. ceasing to account on a cash basis

    * (1) Paragraphs 2950(1)(a) and (ab) and subsection 2950(3) do not apply in relation to any *endorsed charity, any *giftdeductible entity or any *government school.

    * (3) This section does not apply in relation to a *giftdeductible entity endorsed as a deductible gift recipient (within the meaning of the *ITAA 1997) under section 30120 of the ITAA 1997, unless the entity is:

      * (a) an *endorsed charity; or

      * (b) a *government school; or

          * Note: This subsection excludes from this section certain (but not all) giftdeductible entities that are only endorsed for the operation of a fund, authority or institution.

#### Division 158--Hire purchase agreements

##### 1581  What this Division is about

    * If you account on a cash basis, you are treated as if you do not account on a cash basis for any acquisition made under a hire purchase agreement.

##### 1585  Treat as not accounting on a cash basis

    * (1) This section applies if you *account on a cash basis.

    * (2) This Act and the regulations apply in relation to:

      * (a) an acquisition you make under a *hire purchase agreement; or

      * (b) an input tax credit to which you are entitled, or an *adjustment you have, under subsection 5810(1) for an acquisition made under a hire purchase agreement;

    * as if you do not *account on a cash basis.

#### Division 159--Changing your accounting basis

##### 1591  What this Division is about

    * This Division tells you to which tax periods to attribute any supplies and acquisitions that are affected by a change in your accounting basis, and how to treat bad debts if your accounting basis changes.

##### 1595  Ceasing to account on a cash basis--amounts not previously attributed

    * (1) The GST payable by you on a *taxable supply, the input tax credit to which you are entitled for a *creditable acquisition, or an *adjustment that you have, is attributable to a particular tax period (the **_transition tax period_**), and not to any other tax period, if:

      * (a) at the start of the transition tax period, you cease to *account on a cash basis; and

      * (b) the GST on the supply, the input tax credit on the acquisition, or the adjustment, was not attributable, to any extent, to a previous tax period during which you accounted on a cash basis; and

      * (c) it would have been attributable to that previous tax period had you not accounted on a cash basis during that period.

          * For accounting on a cash basis, see Subdivision 29B.

          * Example: In tax period A in the following diagram, you issue an invoice for a supply that you made, but you receive no payment for the supply until tax period D. However, you cease to account on a cash basis at the start of tax period C (which is therefore the transition tax period).

          * Under section 295, the supply was not attributable to tax period A (because at the time you were accounting on a cash basis), but it would have been attributable to that period if you had not been accounting on a cash basis (because you issued the invoice in that period). Therefore the supply is attributable to tax period C (the transition tax period).

    * (2) This section has effect despite sections 295, 2910 and 2920 (which are about attributing GST on supplies, input tax credits on acquisitions, and adjustments) and any other provisions of this Chapter.

##### 15910  Ceasing to account on a cash basis--amounts partly attributed

    * (1) The GST payable by you on a *taxable supply, the input tax credit to which you are entitled for a *creditable acquisition, or an *adjustment that you have, is attributable to a particular tax period (the **_transition tax period_**), and not to any other tax period, if:

      * (a) at the start of the transition tax period, you cease to *account on a cash basis; and

      * (b) the GST on the supply, the input tax credit on the acquisition, or the adjustment, was only to some extent attributable to a previous tax period during which you accounted on a cash basis; and

      * (c) it would have been attributable solely to that previous tax period had you not accounted on a cash basis during that period.

    * (2) However, the GST on the supply, the input tax credit on the acquisition, or the adjustment, is attributable to the transition tax period only to the extent that it has not been previously attributed to one or more of those previous tax periods.

          * For accounting on a cash basis, see Subdivision 29B.

          * Example: Take the example in section 1595 as changed in the following diagram so that you receive part of the payment for the supply in tax period A. The transition tax period is still tax period C.

          * Under section 295, the supply was to some extent attributable to tax period A, but it would have been attributable only to that tax period if you had not been accounting on a cash basis. Therefore the supply is attributable to tax period C (the transition tax period), but only to the extent that it is not attributable to tax period A.

    * (3) This section has effect despite sections 295, 2910 and 2920 (which are about attributing GST on supplies, input tax credits on acquisitions, and adjustments) and any other provisions of this Chapter.

##### 15915  Ceasing to account on a cash basis--bad debts

    * (1) If:

      * (a) the GST payable by you on a *taxable supply or the input tax credit to which you are entitled for a *creditable acquisition is attributable to a particular tax period (the transition tax period) under section 1595 or 15910; and

      * (b) before the start of the transition tax period, the whole or part of a debt relating to the *consideration for the supply or acquisition is written off as bad;

    * then: 

      * (c) the amount written off, and any part of that amount recovered before the start of the transition tax period, is to be treated, for the purposes of Division 21, as if at all relevant times you were not *accounting on a cash basis; and

      * (d) any adjustment arising under Division 21 as a result is attributable to the transition tax period.

    * (2) This section has effect despite subsections 215(2) and 2115(2) (which preclude adjustments for bad debts when accounting on a cash basis) and section 2920 (which is about attributing adjustments).

##### 15920  Starting to account on a cash basis

    * (1) If, at the start of a tax period, you start to *account on a cash basis, then:

      * (a) the GST payable by you on a *taxable supply that you made; or

      * (b) the input tax credit to which you are entitled for a *creditable acquisition; or

      * (c) an *adjustment that you have;

    * that was attributable to one or more previous tax periods remains attributable to those periods, and not to any other tax period.

    * (2) This section has effect despite sections 295, 2910 and 2920 (which are about attributing GST on supplies, input tax credits on acquisitions, and adjustments) and any other provisions of this Chapter.

##### 15925  Starting to account on a cash basis--bad debts

    * (1) If:

      * (a) the GST payable by you on a *taxable supply, or the input tax credit to which you are entitled for a *creditable acquisition, was attributable to a tax period during which you were not *accounting on a cash basis; and

      * (b) at a time when you are accounting on a cash basis, the whole or part of a debt relating to the *consideration for the supply or acquisition is written off as bad;

    * the amount written off, and any part of that amount that is recovered, is to be treated, for the purposes of Division 21, as if at all relevant times you were not accounting on a cash basis.

    * (2) This section has effect despite subsections 215(2) and 2115(2) (which preclude adjustments for bad debts when accounting on a cash basis).

##### 15930  Entities ceasing to exist or coming into existence

    * This Division does not apply in relation to an entity ceasing to *account on a cash basis as it ceases to exist, or in relation to an entity starting to account on a cash basis as it comes into existence.

##### 16210  Your current GST lodgment record

    * (1) If you are not a *member of a *GST group, your **_current GST lodgment record_** is the period, immediately preceding the current tax period applying to you, that is covered by tax periods applying to you for which you have given *GST returns to the Commissioner.

      * (a) for which you have given *GST returns to the Commissioner; and

      * (b) during which the membership of the GST group has not changed.

    * (3) However, if you have been (but are not currently) the *representative member of a *GST group, any tax periods applying to you during which you were such a representative member are not to be counted towards your current GST lodgment record.

##### 16215  Electing to pay GST by instalments

    * (1) You may, by notifying the Commissioner in the *approved form, elect to pay GST by instalments if you are eligible under section 1625.

    * (2) Your election takes effect from:

      * (a) the start of the earliest tax period for which, on the day on which you make your election, your *GST return is not yet due; or

      * (b) the start of such other tax period as the Commissioner allows, in accordance with a request you make in the *approved form.

          * Note: Refusing a request to allow your election to take effect from the start of another tax period is a reviewable GST decision (see Subdivision 110F in Schedule 1 to the_ Taxation Administration Act 1953_).

##### 16220  Elections by representative members of GST groups

    * (1) A *representative member of a *GST group cannot elect to pay GST by instalments unless each *member of the GST group is eligible under section 1625.

    * (2) If the *representative member makes such an election, the *instalment tax period applying to the representative member also applies to each member. However, the members other than the representative member are not *GST instalment payers.

    * (1) You must make your election on or before 28 October in the *financial year to which it relates.

    * Disallowance

    * (3) The Commissioner may disallow your election if, and only if, the Commissioner is satisfied that you have failed to comply with one or more of your obligations under a *taxation law.

          * Note: Disallowing your election is a reviewable GST decision (see Subdivision 110F in Schedule 1 to the_ Taxation Administration Act 1953_).

    * (4) A disallowance of your election is taken to have had effect:

      * (a) if the Commissioner notifies you of the disallowance during the *financial year in which your election first took effect--from the start of the tax period in which it first took effect; or

##### 16255  Tax periods for GST instalment payers

    * (1) The tax period that applies to you, if you are a *GST instalment payer for a *financial year, is that financial year.

    * (2) The tax period that applies to you, if you are a *GST instalment payer only for part of a *financial year, is that part of that financial year.

    * (3) A tax period under this section is an **_instalment tax period_**.

    * (4) This section has effect despite sections 275, 2710, 2715 and 2730 (which are about tax periods).

##### 16260  When GST returns for GST instalment payers must be given

    * (1) You must give your *GST return for the *instalment tax period to the Commissioner:

      * (a) if you are required under section 161 of the *ITAA 1936 to lodge a return in relation to a year of income corresponding to, or ending during, an instalment tax period applying to you--within the period, specified in the notice published in the _Gazette_ under that section, for you to lodge as required under that section; or

      * (b) if paragraph (a) does not apply--on or before the 28 February following the end of the instalment tax period.

          * Note: Section 38855 in Schedule 1 to the _Taxation Administration Act 1953_ allows the Commissioner to defer the time for giving the GST return.

    * (2) However, in relation to an *instalment tax period that:

      * (a) ends on 30 June 2001; or

      * (b) would have ended on 30 June 2001 but for the application of section 2735;

    * the period referred to in paragraph (1)(a) that would otherwise end after 28 February 2002 is taken to end on that day.

          * Note: Under section 2735, the start or finish of a 3 month tax period could vary by up to 7 days from the start or finish of a normal quarter.

    * (3) This section has effect despite sections 318 and 3110 (which are about when GST returns must be given).

##### 16265  The form and contents of GST returns for GST instalment payers

    * (1) If you are a *GST instalment payer only for part of a *financial year, the *approved form for your *GST return for the *instalment tax period consisting of that part of the financial year may require that the return relate to:

      * (b) the one or more preceding tax periods applying to you that fall within the financial year;

    * as if they are a single tax period consisting of the whole of the financial year.

    * (2) This section has effect in addition to, and does not limit the scope of, section 3115 (which is about the form and contents of GST returns).

##### 16270  Payment of GST instalments

    * (1) If you are a *GST instalment payer, you must, for each *instalment tax period applying to you, pay to the Commissioner an amount (your **_GST instalment_**) for each *GST instalment quarter of the instalment tax period.

          * Note 1: GST instalments are worked out under Subdivision 162C.

          * Note 2: Entities covered by section 16280 only pay GST instalments on the last 2 GST instalment quarters.

    * (2) These are the **_GST instalment quarters_** for an *instalment tax period:

      * (a) the 3 months ending on 30 September during the period;

      * (b) the 3 months ending on 31 December during the period;

      * (c) the 3 months ending on 31 March during the period;

      * (d) the 3 months ending on 30 June during the period.

    * (3) However, if the *instalment tax period is only part of a *financial year, any 3 month periods referred to in subsection (2) that do not form part of the instalment tax period are not GST instalment quarters of the instalment tax period.

    * (4) You must pay your *GST instalment to the Commissioner as follows:

          * Note: Section 25510 in Schedule 1 to the _Taxation Administration Act 1953_ allows the Commissioner to defer the time for payment of the GST instalment.

    * (5) You may pay by *electronic payment any *GST instalments payable by you. Any amounts of a GST instalment that you do not pay by electronic payment must be paid in the manner determined in writing by the Commissioner.

    * If: 

      * (a) you are required to pay a *GST instalment; and

    * (1) If:

      * (a) you are a *GST instalment payer for an *instalment tax period; and

      * (b) subsection (2) applies to you;

    * section 16270 has effect as if you are only required to pay *GST instalments for the last 2 *GST instalment quarters for the instalment tax period.

    * (2) This subsection applies to you if:

      * (a) both of the following conditions are satisfied:

        * (i) you are carrying on a *primary production business in an *income year corresponding to, or ending during, the *instalment tax period;

        * (ii) the *assessable income that was *derived from, or resulted from, a primary production business that you carried on in the *base year exceeded the amount of so much of your deductions in that year that are reasonably related to that income; or

      * (b) both of the following conditions are satisfied:

        * (i) you are a *special professional in an income year corresponding to, or ending during, the instalment tax period;

        * (ii) your *assessable professional income in the base year exceeded the amount of so much of your deductions in that year that are reasonably related to that income.

      * (b) a GST instalment payer ceases to *carry on any *enterprise;

      * (c) a GST instalment payer's *registration is cancelled;

    * during an *instalment tax period applying to the GST instalment payer, the instalment tax period is not affected by the death, cessation or cancellation.

    * (2) However, any requirement to pay *GST instalments for a *GST instalment quarter of the *instalment tax period does not apply if the GST instalment quarter commences after:

      * (a) the death or cessation occurred; or

      * (b) the cancellation took effect.

    * (3) This section has effect despite sections 2740 (which is about an entity's concluding tax period) and 16270.

    * (4) However, this section does not affect the application of:

      * (a) section 2739; or

      * (b) if a *GST instalment payer for any reason ceases to exist--section 2740.

##### 16290  The effect of incapacitation or cessation

    * (1) If a *GST instalment payer becomes an *incapacitated entity, or for any reason ceases to exist, the GST instalment payer must give the *GST return, for the *instalment tax period that ends as a result, to the Commissioner:

      * (a) on or before the 21st day of the month following the end of the instalment tax period; or

      * (b) within such further period as the Commissioner allows.

    * (2) If the *assessed net amount for the *instalment tax period is greater than zero, the *GST instalment payer must pay the assessed net amount to the Commissioner on or before the 21st day of the month following the end of the instalment tax period.

    * (3) This section has effect despite sections 16260 (which is about when GST instalment payers must give GST returns) and 162110 (which is about when GST instalment payers must pay assessed net amounts).

      * (b) a *member of a *GST group whose membership changes during an *instalment tax period applying to you;

    * the instalment tax period ends when the membership of the GST group changes.

    * (2) The *representative member of the *GST group must give the *GST return for the *instalment tax period to the Commissioner:

      * (a) on or before the 21st day of the month following the end of the instalment tax period; or

      * (b) within such further period as the Commissioner allows.

    * (3) If the *assessed net amount for the *instalment tax period is greater than zero, the *representative member of the *GST group must pay the assessed net amount to the Commissioner on or before the 21st day of the month following the end of the instalment tax period.

    * (4) This section has effect despite sections 16255 (which is about tax periods for GST instalment payers), 16260 (which is about when GST instalment payers must give GST returns) and 162110 (which is about when GST instalment payers must pay assessed net amounts).

##### 162100  General interest charge on late payment

    * If you fail to pay some or all of a *GST instalment by the time by which the GST instalment is due to be paid, you are liable to pay the *general interest charge on the unpaid amount for each day in the period that:

      * (a) started at the beginning of the day by which the GST instalment was due to be paid; and

      * (b) finishes at the end of the last day on which, at the end of the day, any of the following remains unpaid:

        * (i) the GST instalment;

        * (ii) general interest charge on any of the instalment.

##### 162105  Net amounts for GST instalment payers

    * If you are a *GST instalment payer, your *net amount for an *instalment tax period is the difference between:

      * (a) the amount that, but for this section, would be your *net amount under section 175, 12315 or 1265 for the instalment tax period; and

      * (b) the sum of all of the *GST instalments payable by you for the *GST instalment quarters of the instalment tax period.

##### 162110  When payments of assessed net amounts must be made--GST instalment payers

    * (1) If:

      * (a) you are a *GST instalment payer; and

      * (b) the *assessed net amount for an *instalment tax period applying to you is greater than zero;

    * you must pay the assessed net amount to the Commissioner on or before the day on which, under section 16260, you are required to give to the Commissioner your *GST return for the instalment tax period.

    * (2) This section has effect despite sections 333 and 335 (which are about when payments of assessed net amounts are made).

##### Subdivision 162C--GST instalments

##### 162130  What are your GST instalments

    * (1) If you are a *GST instalment payer, your *GST instalments for the *GST instalment quarters of an *instalment tax period applying to you are worked out under subsections (2) and (3).

    * (2) Your *GST instalment for the first *GST instalment quarter is whichever of the following you choose:

      * (a) your *notified instalment amount for the GST instalment quarter; or

      * (b) your *varied instalment amount for the GST instalment quarter.

      * (a) worked out by the Commissioner; and

      * (b) notified by the Commissioner to you before the day on which the *GST instalment is due.

    * The amount must not be less than zero.

    * (2) However, the Commissioner is not to work out or notify a *notified instalment amount for a *GST instalment quarter if you had a *varied instalment amount for an earlier GST instalment quarter of the same *instalment tax period.

##### 162140  Varied instalment amounts

    * (1) You may, by notifying the Commissioner in the *approved form, substitute another amount for:

      * (a) your *notified instalment amount for a *GST instalment quarter; or

      * (b) if paragraph 162130(3)(b) applies to a GST instalment quarter--your *GST instalment for the preceding GST instalment quarter.

    * The amount substituted is your **_varied instalment amount_** for the GST instalment quarter.

    * (2) The amount substituted must not be less than zero.

    * (3) You must give the notice to the Commissioner on or before the day on which the *GST instalment for the *GST instalment quarter is due.

    * (4) You must include in the notice an estimate of your *annual GST liability relating to the *instalment tax period in question. This estimate is your **_estimated annual GST amount_** relating to the *GST instalment quarter.

          * Note 1: You may be liable to penalty under Subdivision 162D if your variation of the notified instalment amount is too much of an underestimate of your total GST liability.

          * Note 2: Your estimated annual GST amount is taken to be zero if it would otherwise be less than zero (see subsection (6)).

    * (5) However, if paragraph 162130(3)(b) applies to a *GST instalment quarter but you do not, under subsection (1) of this section, substitute another amount by notifying the Commissioner in the *approved form:

##### 162145  Your annual GST liability

    * (1) Your **_annual GST liability_**, for an *instalment tax period that is a *financial year, is the amount that would be your *net amount for the period if it were not reduced under section 162105.

    * (2) Your **_annual GST liability_**, for an *instalment tax period that is only part of a *financial year, is the sum of:

      * (a) the amount that would be your *net amount for the period if it were not reduced under section 162105; and

      * (b) your *early net amounts for the financial year (subtracting any of those amounts that are less than zero).

    * (3) Your **_early net amounts_** for the *financial year are your *assessed net amounts for any tax periods that:

      * (a) started, or would but for section 2735 have started, at the start of or during that financial year; and

      * (b) ended before the start of the *instalment tax period applying to you that forms part of that financial year.

          * Note: Under section 2735, the start or finish of a 3 month tax period could vary by up to 7 days from the start or finish of a normal quarter.

##### Subdivision 162D--Penalty payable in certain cases if varied instalment amounts are too low

##### 162170  What this Subdivision is about

    * There are 3 circumstances where a penalty can arise if a varied instalment amount is too low: 

          * (a) your payments are too low a proportion of your annual GST liability (see section 162175);

          * (b) your estimated annual GST amount is too low a proportion of your annual GST liability (see section 162180);

          * (c) the varied instalment amount is too low a proportion of your estimated annual GST amount (see section 162185).

    * The penalty is based on the general interest charge rate, and the machinery provisions of Division 298 in Schedule 1 to the _Taxation Administration Act 1953_ apply.

          * Note: This section is an explanatory section.

##### 162175  GST payments are less than 85% of annual GST liability

    * (1) You are liable to pay a penalty, for a *GST instalment quarter of an *instalment tax period applying to you, if you have a *varied instalment amount for the GST instalment quarter, and:

      * (a) if the instalment tax period is a *financial year--the sum of your *GST instalments for all the GST instalment quarters of the instalment tax period is less than 85% of your *annual GST liability for the instalment tax period; or

      * (b) if the instalment tax period is only part of a financial year--the sum of:

        * (i) your *GST instalments for all the GST instalment quarters of the instalment tax period; and

        * (ii) your *early net amounts for the financial year (subtracting any of those amounts that are less than zero);

      * is less than 85% of your annual GST liability for the instalment tax period.

      * (b) all your other *GST instalments (if any) for earlier *GST instalment quarters of the *instalment tax period in question; and

      * (c) if the instalment tax period is only part of a *financial year--your *early net amounts for the financial year (subtracting any of those amounts that are less than zero).

    * (4) However, if:

      * (a) the *GST instalment quarter is not the first GST instalment quarter of the *instalment tax period in question; and

      * (b) you are liable for one or more penalties under this section in relation to any of the earlier GST instalment quarters of the instalment tax period;

    * then: 

      * (c) your **_GST instalment shortfall_**, under this section, for the *GST instalment quarter is the difference between:

        * (i) the amount worked out using the formula in subsection (3); and

        * (ii) the sum of all your GST instalment shortfalls for those earlier GST instalment quarters; and

      * (d) if that sum is greater than the amount worked out using the formula in subsection (3)--you are not liable to pay a penalty under this section in relation to the GST instalment quarter.

    * (5) The **_appropriate percentage_** for a *GST instalment quarter is:

      * (a) if the GST instalment quarter ends on 30 September--25%; or

      * (b) if the GST instalment quarter ends on 31 December--50%; or

      * (c) if the GST instalment quarter ends on 31 March--75%; or

        * (ii) if the GST instalment quarter ends on 30 September 2001--75% of your *annual GST liability for the instalment tax period; and

      * (d) the varied instalment amount is less than or equal to 25% of your annual GST liability for the instalment tax period.

    * (2) The amount of the penalty, for a particular day, is worked out by applying the *general interest charge:

    * (5) For the purpose of working out your *GST instalment shortfall under this section, your *estimated annual GST amount relating to the *GST instalment quarter is taken to be the amount worked out as follows, if the amount is less than that estimated annual GST amount:

    * where: 

    * **_GST already payable_** is the sum of:

      * (a) the *varied instalment amount in question; and

        * (iii) if the instalment tax period is only part of a *financial year--your *early net amounts for the financial year (subtracting any of those amounts that are less than zero).

    * (2) The amount of the penalty, for a particular day, is worked out by applying the *general interest charge:

      * (a) started at the beginning of the day by which the *GST instalment, for the *GST instalment quarter to which the charge relates, was due to be paid; and

      * (b) finishes at the end of the day before which you must, under section 162110, pay to the Commissioner your *assessed net amount for the *instalment tax period that includes that GST instalment quarter.

##### 162195  Reduction in penalties if notified instalment amount is less than 25% of annual GST liability

    * (1) This section reduces your *GST instalment shortfall, for a *GST instalment quarter of an *instalment tax period applying to you, if:

      * (a) you are liable to pay a penalty under section 162175 or 162180 for a *GST instalment quarter of an *instalment tax period applying to you; and

      * (b) for that or any other GST instalment quarter of an *instalment tax period:

        * (i) you have a *notified instalment amount that is less than 25% of your *annual GST liability for the instalment tax period; or

        * (ii) you do not have a notified instalment amount, but the Commissioner is satisfied that, if you had such a notified instalment amount, it would be less than 25% of your annual GST liability for the instalment tax period.

    * (2) The *GST instalment shortfall is reduced by the amount worked out as follows:

    * where: 

    * **_notified and other amounts_** is the sum of:

      * (a) the *notified instalment amount, or, if you do not have a notified instalment amount for the *GST instalment quarter, the amount that the Commissioner is satisfied would have otherwise been that notified instalment amount; and

      * (b) for each of the earlier GST instalment quarters (if any) of the *instalment tax period in question:

        * (i) the notified instalment amount; or

        * (ii) if you do not have a notified instalment amount for the *GST instalment quarter--the amount that the Commissioner is satisfied would have otherwise been that notified instalment amount; and

      * (c) if the instalment tax period is only part of a *financial year--your *early net amounts for the financial year (subtracting any of those amounts that are less than zero).

    * (3) If, because of the reduction, your *GST instalment shortfall for the *GST instalment quarter is zero or less than zero, you are not liable to pay a penalty under section 162175 or 162180 (as the case requires) in relation to the GST instalment quarter.

    * (4) If both this section and section 162200 apply to a particular *GST instalment shortfall, apply this section to the shortfall before applying section 162200.

##### 162200  Reduction in penalties if GST instalment shortfall is made up in a later instalment

    * (1) This section reduces your *GST instalment shortfall, for a *GST instalment quarter of an *instalment tax period applying to you, if:

      * (a) you pay to the Commissioner a *GST instalment for a later GST instalment quarter of the instalment tax period; and

      * (b) that GST instalment exceeds 25% of your *annual GST liability for the instalment tax period.

    * The amount of that excess is called the **_top up_**.

    * (2) The *GST instalment shortfall is reduced by applying so much of the top up as does not exceed the GST instalment shortfall.

    * (3) However, if some of the top up has already been applied (under any other application or applications of this section) to reduce a *GST instalment shortfall for a different *GST instalment quarter of the *instalment tax period, the GST instalment shortfall is reduced by applying so much of the top up as has not already been applied, and does not exceed the GST instalment shortfall.

    * (4) The reduction under subsection (2) has effect for each day in the period that:

      * (a) started at the beginning of the day on which you paid the *GST instalment for the later *GST instalment quarter; and

      * (b) finishes at the end of the day before which you must, under section 162110, pay to the Commissioner your *assessed net amount for the *instalment tax period.

##### 162205  This Subdivision does not create a liability for general interest charge

    * For the avoidance of doubt, this Subdivision does not have the effect of making you liable to pay the *general interest charge.

#### Division 165--Antiavoidance

##### Table of Subdivisions

      * 165A	Application of this Division

      * 165B	Commissioner may negate effects of schemes for GST benefits

##### 1651  What this Division is about

    * The object of this Division is to deter schemes to give entities benefits by reducing GST, increasing refunds or altering the timing of payment of GST or refunds.

    * If the dominant purpose or principal effect of a scheme is to give an entity such a benefit, the Commissioner may negate the benefit an entity gets from the scheme by declaring how much GST or refund would have been payable, and when it would have been payable, apart from the scheme.

    * This Division is aimed at artificial or contrived schemes. It is not, for example, intended to apply to:

      *  	an exporter electing to have monthly tax periods in order to bring forward the entitlement to input tax credits; or

      *  	a supplier of child care applying to be approved under the _A New Tax System (Family Assistance) (Administration) Act 1999_ (this would make the supplies of child care GSTfree); or

      *  	a supplier choosing under section 925 of the Wine Tax Act to use the average wholesale price method for working out the taxable value of retail sales of grape wine; or

      *  	a bank having its car fleet serviced earlier than usual, and before 1 July 2000, so that the servicing does not, at least initially, bear the GST.

##### Subdivision 165A--Application of this Division

##### 1655  When does this Division operate?

    * General rule

    * (1) This Division operates if:

      * (a) an entity (the **_avoider_**) gets or got a *GST benefit from a *scheme; and

      * (b) the GST benefit is not attributable to the making, by any entity, of a choice, election, application or agreement that is expressly provided for by the *GST law, the *wine tax law or the *luxury car tax law; and

      * (c) taking account of the matters described in section 16515, it is reasonable to conclude that either:

        * (i) an entity that (whether alone or with others) entered into or carried out the scheme, or part of the scheme, did so with the sole or dominant purpose of that entity or another entity getting a *GST benefit from the scheme; or

        * (ii) the principal effect of the scheme, or of part of the scheme, is that the avoider gets the GST benefit from the scheme directly or indirectly; and

      * the headings for groups of sections of this Act (group headings);

      * the notes and examples (however described) that follow provisions of this Act.

    * (2) The asterisks used to identify defined terms form part of this Act. However, if a term is not identified by an asterisk, disregard that fact in deciding whether or not to apply to that term a definition or other interpretation provision.

##### 1825  What does not form part of this Act

    * These do not form part of this Act: 

      * footnotes and endnotes;

      * Tables of Subdivisions.

##### 18210  Explanatory sections, and their role in interpreting this Act

    * (1) An**_ explanatory section_** is:

      * (a) any section that is the first section in a Division and that has as its heading "What this Division is about"; or

      * (b) any section in Chapter 1 (other than sections 11 and 12); or

      * (c) any section in Division 5 or 37; or

      * (d) any section that is the last section in a Division or Subdivision of Chapter 2 and that has a checklist of special rules in Chapter 4; or

      * (e) any section that a note states to be an explanatory section.

    * (2) Explanatory sections form part of this Act, but they are not operative provisions. In interpreting an operative provision, an explanatory section may only be considered:

      * (a) in determining the purpose or object underlying the provision; or

      * (b) to confirm that the provision's meaning is the ordinary meaning conveyed by its text, taking into account its context in this Act and the purpose or object underlying the provision; or

      * (c) in determining the provision's meaning if the provision is ambiguous or obscure; or

      * (d) in determining the provision's meaning if the ordinary meaning conveyed by its text, taking into account its context in this Act and the purpose or object underlying the provision, leads to a result that is manifestly absurd or is unreasonable.

##### 18215  Schedules 1, 2 and 3

    * The second columns of the tables in Schedules 1, 2 and 3 are not operative. In interpreting an item in those tables, or any other operative provision, those columns may only be considered for a purpose for which an *explanatory section may be considered under subsection 18210(2).

### Part 62--Meaning of some important concepts

#### Division 184--Meaning of entity

##### 1841  Entities

    * (1) **_Entity_** means any of the following:

      * (a) an individual;

      * (b) a body corporate;

      * (c) a corporation sole;

      * (d) a body politic;

      * (e) a *partnership;

      * (f) any other unincorporated association or body of persons;

      * (g) a trust;

      * (h) a *superannuation fund.

          * Note: The term **_entity_** is used in a number of different but related senses. It covers all kinds of legal persons. It also covers groups of legal persons, and other things, that in practice are treated as having a separate identity in the same way as a legal person does.

    * (1A) Paragraph (1)(f) does not include a *nonentity joint venture. 

    * (2) The trustee of a trust or of a *superannuation fund is taken to be an entity consisting of the person who is the trustee, or the persons who are the trustees, at any given time.

          * Note 1: This is because a right or obligation cannot be conferred or imposed on an entity that is not a legal person.

          * Note 2: The entity that is the trustee of a trust or fund does not change merely because of a change in the person who is the trustee of the trust or fund, or persons who are the trustees of the trust or fund.

    * (3) A legal person can have a number of different capacities in which the person does things. In each of those capacities, the person is taken to be a different entity.

          * Example: In addition to his or her personal capacity, an individual may be:

             * sole trustee of one or more trusts; and
