     * (b) will otherwise deal with matters, things or relationships outside Australia.

    * (3) Despite subsection 14(2) of the _Legislative Instruments Act 2003_, regulations made for the purposes of subsection (1) may make provision in relation to a matter by applying, adopting or incorporating any matter contained in an instrument or other writing as in force or existing from time to time.

##### 11  Regulations may have extraterritorial effect

     * (d) an instrument made under such a law.

##### 13  Later Acts not to be interpreted as overriding this Part or the regulations

    * (1) An Act enacted at or after the commencement of this section is not to be interpreted as:

     * (a) amending or repealing, or otherwise altering the effect or operation of, a provision of this Part or of the regulations; or

     * (b) authorising the making of an instrument amending or repealing, or otherwise altering the effect or operation of, a provision of this Part or of the regulations.

    * (2) Subsection (1) does not affect the interpretation of an Act so far as that Act provides expressly for that Act, or for an instrument made under that Act, to have effect despite this Act, despite the regulations, or despite a specified provision of this Act or of the regulations.

#### Division 2--Enforcing the regulations

##### 14  Injunctions

    * (1) If a person has engaged, is engaging, or proposes to engage, in conduct involving a contravention of the regulations, a superior court may by order grant an injunction restraining the person from engaging in the conduct.

    * (2) An injunction may be granted only on application by the AttorneyGeneral.

    * (3) On an application, the court may grant an injunction by consent of all parties to the proceedings, whether or not the court is satisfied that subsection (1) applies.

    * (4) A superior court may grant an interim injunction pending its determination of an application.

    * (5) A court is not to require the AttorneyGeneral or anyone else to give an undertaking as to damages, as a condition of granting an interim injunction.

    * (6) A court may discharge or vary an injunction it has granted.

    * (7) The power to grant or vary an injunction restraining a person from engaging in conduct may be exercised:

     * (a) whether or not it appears to the court that the person intends to engage again, or to continue to engage, in such conduct; and

     * (b) whether or not the person has previously engaged in such conduct.

##### 15  Invalidation of authorisations

    * An authorisation (however described) granted under the regulations is taken never to have been granted if information contained in, or information or a document accompanying, the application for the authorisation:

     * (a) is false or misleading in a material particular; or

     * (b) omits any matter or thing without which the information or document is misleading in a material particular.
