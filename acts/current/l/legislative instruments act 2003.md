     * (2) Despite any provision in a law of the Commonwealth to the contrary, the order of a court referred to in paragraph (1)(b) to quash or set aside the decision to issue a certificate under this section takes effect only from the time immediately before the issue of the replacement certificate.

     * (3) If the AttorneyGeneral decides, on reconsideration of the matter:

      * (a) that an instrument that he or she has certified to be a legislative instrument is not such an instrument; or

      * (b) that an instrument of a kind that he or she has certified will be a legislative instrument will not be such an instrument;

     * then, except in relation to an instrument to which subsection 5(3) applies:

      * (c) that instrument, or an instrument of that kind made after the issue of the original certificate, that would, but for its registration, have been required to be notified in the _Gazette_, must be so notified as soon as practicable but not later than 3 working days after the issue of the replacement certificate; and

      * (a) that an instrument that he or she certified not to be a legislative instrument is such an instrument; or

      * (b) that an instrument of a kind that he or she has certified will not be a legislative instrument will be such an instrument;

     * then: 

      * (c) that instrument, or an instrument of that kind made after the issue of the original certificate, must be registered:

       * (i) if Division 3 of Part 4 is applicable to the instrument--by the last day for lodgment for registration under that Division; or

       * (ii) if that Division is not applicable or that day has already passed--as soon as practicable but not later than 3 working days after the issue of the replacement certificate; and

      * (d) if the instrument is so registered, it is taken, for all purposes of this Act, to have been so registered within the time required by this Act for its registration; and

      * (e) any act or thing done in accordance with, or in reliance on, the instrument, whether before or after its registration, is taken to have been validly done.

     * (5) If the AttorneyGeneral decides, on reconsideration of the matter:

      * (a) that an instrument that he or she has certified to be a legislative instrument is such an instrument; or

      * (b) that an instrument of a kind that he or she has certified will be a legislative instrument will be such an instrument;

     * then: 

      * (c) the requirement for registration of that instrument or of an instrument of that kind is unaffected; and

      * (d) any registration of that instrument or of an instrument of that kind that is already effected remains effective.

     * (6) If the AttorneyGeneral decides, on reconsideration of the matter:

      * (a) that an instrument that he or she has certified not to be a legislative instrument is not a legislative instrument; or

      * (b) that an instrument of a kind that he or she has certified will not be a legislative instrument will not be such an instrument;

     * then: 

      * (c) any requirement for notification in the _Gazette_ of the making of that instrument or of an instrument of that kind is unaffected; and

      * (d) any notification in the _Gazette_ of the making of that instrument or of an instrument of that kind that is already effected remains effective.

     * (7) In any case where a court referred to in paragraph (1)(b) makes an order quashing or setting aside a decision to issue a certificate under section 10, the AttorneyGeneral must:

      * (a) as soon as practicable after that order is made, notify the person or body having authority to make the instrument, in writing, of the court's decision; and

      * (b) as soon as practicable after the issue of a replacement certificate--give a copy of the replacement certificate to the applicant for the original certificate and to the person or body having authority to make the instrument.

     * (8) A replacement certificate issued under this section is a legislative instrument and, as such, is required under Part 4 to be registered.

     * (9) Subsection (1) applies in respect of a decision to issue a replacement certificate in the same manner as it applies to the original decision to issue a certificate under section 10.

      * (a) the rights of a person (other than the Commonwealth or an authority of the Commonwealth) as at the date of registration would be affected so as to disadvantage that person; or

      * (b) liabilities would be imposed on a person (other than the Commonwealth or an authority of the Commonwealth) in respect of anything done or omitted to be done before the date of registration.

     * (3) The effect of subsections (1) and (2) on a legislative instrument is subject to any contrary provision for commencement of the instrument in the enabling legislation for the instrument if the enabling legislation is an Act or a provision of an Act.

##### 13  Construction of legislative instruments

     * (1) If enabling legislation confers on a rulemaker the power to make a legislative instrument, then, unless the contrary intention appears:

      * (a) the _Acts Interpretation Act 1901_ applies to any legislative instrument so made as if it were an Act and as if each provision of the legislative instrument were a section of an Act; and

      * (b) expressions used in any legislative instrument so made have the same meaning as in the enabling legislation as in force from time to time; and

      * (c) any legislative instrument so made is to be read and construed subject to the enabling legislation as in force from time to time, and so as not to exceed the power of the rulemaker.

     * (2) If any legislative instrument would, but for this subsection, be construed as being in excess of the rulemaker's power, it is to be taken to be a valid instrument to the extent to which it is not in excess of that power.

     * (3) If enabling legislation confers on a rulemaker the power to make a legislative instrument:

      * (a) specifying, declaring or prescribing a matter; or

      * (b) doing anything in relation to a matter;

     * then, in exercising the power, the rulemaker may identify the matter by referring to a class or classes of matters.

     * (4) For the purposes of subsection (3), **_matter _**includes thing, person and animal.

         * Note: This section has a parallel, in relation to instruments that are not legislative instruments, in subsection 33(3AB) and section 46 of the _Acts Interpretation Act 1901_.

##### 14  Prescribing matters by reference to other instruments

     * (1) If enabling legislation authorises or requires provision to be made in relation to any matter in a legislative instrument, the legislative instrument may, unless the contrary intention appears, make provision in relation to that matter:

      * (a) by applying, adopting or incorporating, with or without modification, the provisions of any Act, or of any disallowable legislative instrument, as in force at a particular time or as in force from time to time; or

      * (b) subject to subsection (2), by applying, adopting or incorporating, with or without modification, any matter contained in any other instrument or writing as in force or existing at the time when the firstmentioned legislative instrument takes effect.

     * (2) Unless the contrary intention appears, the legislative instrument may not make provision in relation to a matter by applying, adopting or incorporating any matter contained in an instrument or other writing as in force or existing from time to time.

         * Note: This section has a parallel, in relation to instruments that are not legislative instruments, in section 46AA of the _Acts Interpretation Act 1901_.

### Part 2--Drafting standards

##### 16  Measures to achieve high drafting standards for legislative instruments

     * (1) To encourage high standards in the drafting of legislative instruments, the First Parliamentary Counsel must cause steps to be taken to promote the legal effectiveness, clarity, and intelligibility to anticipated users, of legislative instruments.

     * (2) The steps referred to in subsection (1) may include, but are not limited to:

      * (a) undertaking or supervising the drafting of legislative instruments; and

      * (b) scrutinising preliminary drafts of legislative instruments; and

      * (c) providing advice concerning the drafting of legislative instruments; and

      * (d) providing training in drafting and matters related to drafting to officers and employees of Departments or other agencies; and

      * (e) arranging the temporary secondment to Departments or other agencies of APS employees performing duties in the Office of Parliamentary Counsel; and

      * (f) providing drafting precedents to officers and employees of Departments or other agencies.

     * (3) The First Parliamentary Counsel must also cause steps to be taken:

      * (a) to prevent the inappropriate use of genderspecific language in legislative instruments; and

      * (b) to advise rulemakers of legislative instruments that have already been made if those legislative instruments make inappropriate use of such language; and

      * (c) to notify both Houses of the Parliament about any occasion when a rulemaker is advised under paragraph (b).

### Part 3--Consultation before making legislative instruments

##### 17  Rulemakers should consult before making legislative instruments

     * (1) Before a rulemaker makes a legislative instrument, and particularly where the proposed instrument is likely to:

      * (a) have a direct, or a substantial indirect, effect on business; or

      * (b) restrict competition;

     * the rulemaker must be satisfied that any consultation that is considered by the rulemaker to be appropriate and that is reasonably practicable to undertake, has been undertaken.

     * (2) In determining whether any consultation that was undertaken is appropriate, the rulemaker may have regard to any relevant matter, including the extent to which the consultation:

      * (a) drew on the knowledge of persons having expertise in fields relevant to the proposed instrument; and

      * (b) ensured that persons likely to be affected by the proposed instrument had an adequate opportunity to comment on its proposed content.

     * (3) Without limiting, by implication, the form that consultation referred to in subsection (1) might take, such consultation could involve notification, either directly or by advertisement, of bodies that, or of organisations representative of persons who, are likely to be affected by the proposed instrument. Such notification could invite submissions to be made by a specified date or might invite participation in public hearings to be held concerning the proposed instrument.

         * Note: Under subsection 26(1A), an explanatory statement relating to a legislative instrument must include a description of consultation undertaken or, if there was no consultation, an explanation for its absence.

##### 18  Circumstances where consultation may be unnecessary or inappropriate

     * (1) Despite section 17, the nature of an instrument may be such that consultation may be unnecessary or inappropriate.

     * (2) The following are examples of instruments having a nature such that the rulemaker may be satisfied that consultation is unnecessary or inappropriate:

      * (a) an instrument that is of a minor or machinery nature and that does not substantially alter existing arrangements; or

      * (b) an instrument that is required as a matter of urgency; or

      * (c) an instrument that gives effect, in terms announced in the Budget, to a decision:

       * (i) to repeal, impose or adjust a tax, fee or charge; or

       * (ii) to confer, revoke or alter an entitlement; or

       * (iii) to impose, revoke or alter an obligation; or

      * (d) an instrument that is required because of an issue of national security; or

      * (e) an instrument in relation to which appropriate consultation has already been undertaken by someone other than the rulemaker; or

      * (f) an instrument that relates to employment; or

      * (g) an instrument that relates to the management of, or to the service of members of, the Australian Defence Force.

##### 19  Consequence of failure to consult

     * The fact that consultation does not occur does not affect the validity or enforceability of a legislative instrument.

### Part 4--The Federal Register of Legislative Instruments

#### Division 1--The Register

##### 20  Federal Register of Legislative Instruments

     * (1) The First Parliamentary Counsel is to cause to be maintained a register to be known as the Federal Register of Legislative Instruments.

     * (1A) The First Parliamentary Counsel must cause steps to be taken to ensure that legislative instruments that are registered are available to the public.

     * (2) The Register comprises, at any time, a database of all legislative instruments, all explanatory statements in relation to legislative instruments made on or after the commencing day, and all compilations in relation to legislative instruments, that have been registered under this Act.

##### 21  Manner of keeping Register

     * (1) The regulations may prescribe the manner in which the Register is to be kept.

     * (2) Without limiting the generality of subsection (1), regulations made under that subsection may require that any person required to lodge a legislative instrument for registration must also lodge such information relating to the legislative instrument as the regulations provide, in such form as the regulations provide, to ensure that the Register is as useful as possible to persons wishing to use it.

     * (3) Without limiting the generality of subsection (1), regulations made under that subsection may provide:

      * (a) for the manner in which the Register is required to be kept including:

       * (i) the manner of recording information required to be included in the Register; and

       * (ii) the manner of altering information required to be included in the Register; and

      * (b) for giving a unique identifier to each legislative instrument that is registered; and

      * (c) for giving a unique identifier to each compilation, in relation to a legislative instrument, that is registered.

##### 22  The status of the Register and judicial notice of legislative instruments and compilations

     * (1) The Register is, for all purposes, to be taken to be a complete and accurate record of all legislative instruments that are included in the Register.

     * (2) A compilation that is included in the Register and that relates to a particular legislative instrument is to be taken, unless the contrary is proved, to be a complete and accurate record of that legislative instrument as amended and in force at the date specified in the compilation.

     * (3) In any proceedings, proof is not required about the provisions and coming into operation (in whole or in part) of a legislative instrument as it appears in the Register.

     * (4) A court or tribunal may inform itself about those matters in any way that it thinks fit.

     * (5) It is presumed, unless the contrary is proved, that a document that purports to be an extract from the Register is what it purports to be.

     * (6) If:

      * (a) subsection (5) applies to a document; and

      * (b) the document purports to be a copy of, or a copy of a part of, a legislative instrument that was registered on a particular day and at a particular time;

     * then it is presumed, unless the contrary is proved and subject to the operation of section 36 in the circumstances described in that section, that the legislative instrument was registered on that day and at that time.

##### 23  Rectification of Register

     * (1) If:

      * (a) the First Parliamentary Counsel becomes aware that the Register is erroneous because of a mistake or omission; and

      * (b) the First Parliamentary Counsel is satisfied that:

       * (i) so far as legislative instruments are concerned--the error lies in the text, in electronic form, of such a legislative instrument as it appears in the Register and not in the original legislative instrument, or other evidence of the text of that instrument, lodged under subsection 25(2) or 29(3); and

       * (ii) so far as compilations are concerned--the error lies in the text, in electronic form, of such a compilation as it appears in the Register in that the text does not represent the state of the law that it purports to represent;

     * the First Parliamentary Counsel must arrange for the Register to be altered to rectify the error as soon as possible and annotate the Register as so rectified to explain the nature of the rectification, the date and time it was made and the reason for it.

     * (2) An alteration of the Register under subsection (1):

      * (a) does not affect any right or privilege that was acquired, or that accrued, by reason of reliance on the content of the Register before that alteration was made; or

      * (b) does not impose or increase any obligation or liability that was incurred before that alteration was made.

#### Division 2--Registration of legislative instruments made, or treated as made, on or after commencing day

##### 24  Legislative instruments required to be registered under this Division

     * If a legislative instrument: 

      * (a) is made on or after the commencing day; or

      * (b) is to be treated, under subsection 55(2), as if made on that day;

     * the legislative instrument must be registered in accordance with this Division.

         * Note: See subsection 29(2) concerning the lodgment for registration of instruments made before the commencing day that are amended by instruments made on or after that day.

##### 25  Lodgment for registration under this Division

     * (1) If a legislative instrument is required to be registered under this Division, the rulemaker must, as soon as practicable after making that legislative instrument, lodge the instrument in electronic form with the Office of Parliamentary Counsel for registration.

     * (2) At the time of, or as soon as practicable after, the lodgment of the legislative instrument under subsection (1), the rulemaker must also lodge:

      * (a) the original legislative instrument; or

      * (b) if the rulemaker cannot comply with paragraph (a)--a certified true copy of the original legislative instrument; or

      * (c) if:

       * (i) the rulemaker cannot comply with paragraph (a) or (b); and

       * (ii) the enabling legislation required that the full text of the original legislative instrument be published in the _Gazette_ or elsewhere;

      * the full text of that original legislative instrument as so published; or

      * (d) if the rulemaker cannot comply with paragraph (a), (b) or (c)--such other evidence of the text of the original legislative instrument as the First Parliamentary Counsel considers acceptable.

##### 26  Explanatory statements

     * (1) If a legislative instrument is lodged for registration under this Division, the rulemaker must also lodge for registration, at the same time or as soon as practicable thereafter, the explanatory statement in electronic form that relates to that instrument.

     * (1A) For the purposes of this Act, an explanatory statement in relation to a legislative instrument must:

      * (a) be prepared by the rulemaker; and

      * (b) explain the purpose and operation of the instrument; and

      * (c) if any documents are incorporated in the instrument by reference--contain a description of the documents so incorporated and indicate how they may be obtained; and

      * (d) if consultation was undertaken under section 17 before the instrument was made--contain a description of the nature of that consultation; and

      * (e) if no such consultation was undertaken--explain why no such consultation was undertaken; and

      * (f) if section 42 applies to the instrument--contain a statement of compatibility prepared under subsection 9(1) of the _Human Rights (Parliamentary Scrutiny) Act 2011_; and

      * (g) contain such other information as is prescribed by the regulations.

     * (1B) For the avoidance of doubt, the requirement in paragraph (1A)(b):

      * (a) may be met by an explanation that the instrument replaces a specified earlier legislative instrument or a specified provision of an earlier legislative instrument and is the same in substance as the specified instrument or provision; and

      * (b) may be met in relation to a particular provision of the instrument by an explanation that the provision replaces a specified earlier legislative instrument or a specified provision of an earlier legislative instrument and is the same in substance as the specified instrument or provision.

     * (1C) Subsection (1B) does not limit the ways in which the requirement in paragraph (1A)(b) may be met. Paragraph (1B)(b) does not imply that paragraph (1A)(b) requires a separate explanation of the purpose and operation of each provision of the instrument.

     * (1D) A single explanatory statement may relate to one or more legislative instruments.

     * (2) A failure by the rulemaker to lodge the explanatory statement in relation to an instrument in accordance with subsection (1) does not affect the validity or enforceability of the instrument.

         * Note: The obligation imposed on a rulemaker to comply with this section is not affected by the rulemaker's compliance with subsection 39(2).

##### 27  Registration under this Division

     * (1) The First Parliamentary Counsel is to cause to be registered each legislative instrument lodged under subsection 25(1) and each explanatory statement lodged under subsection 26(1).

       * (ii) each other legislative instrument (if any) that is required to be registered under this Division and that amends the principal legislative instrument.

     * (2) If:

      * (a) a legislative instrument is made on or after the commencing day; and

      * (b) the legislative instrument amends another legislative instrument (the **_principal legislative instrument_**) made before the commencing day that has not already been registered;

     * (2) If:

      * (a) a legislative instrument is required to be registered under Division 2; and

      * (b) because of technical difficulties the instrument is temporarily unable to be so registered;

     * the First Parliamentary Counsel may cause the instrument to be published in full in the _Gazette_.

     * (3) If the First Parliamentary Counsel causes a legislative instrument to be published in the _Gazette_ in the circumstances referred to in subsection (2):

      * (a) this Act has effect as if the instrument had been registered at the time when it was published in the _Gazette_; and

      * (b) the First Parliamentary Counsel must, as soon as practicable after the instrument is able to be entered in the Register, cause the instrument to be so entered with an annotation as to the day and time at which the instrument is taken to have been registered.

##### 32  Effect of failure to lodge for registration a legislative instrument required to be registered under Division 3

     * (1) This section applies to a legislative instrument if:

      * (a) the instrument is required to be registered under Division 3; and

      * (b) the instrument is not lodged for registration on or before the last day for lodging the instrument for registration (the **_last lodgment day_**) worked out under section 29.

         * Note: Division 3 deals with the registration of certain legislative instruments made before the commencing day.

     * (2) On the day after the last lodgment day, the instrument:

      * (a) ceases to be enforceable by or against the Commonwealth, or by or against any other person or body; and

      * (b) is taken to have been repealed by this Act.

     * (3) Despite subsection (2), and, if the operation of subsection 12(2) would otherwise cause the instrument not to have taken effect, despite that subsection, the instrument is taken to have continued in force after the last lodgment day if:

      * (a) the instrument is connected with the collection of revenue; and

      * (b) the AttorneyGeneral certifies in writing that:

       * (i) he or she is satisfied that the responsible officer was unaware of the requirement to register the instrument; and

      * (b) by another legislative instrument (the **_amending legislative instrument_**);

     * the First Parliamentary Counsel must cause to be registered a compilation, in electronic form, in relation to the principal legislative instrument, as soon as practicable:

      * **_	_**(c)	after the provision or provisions of that Act that amend that instrument have commenced; or

      * (d) after the amending legislative instrument is registered and has commenced.

      * (b) an amending legislative instrument, the effect of which is incorporated within the compilation, is subsequently disallowed, in whole or in part; and

      * (c) the effect of the disallowance is that:

       * (i) a compilation is no longer required because the principal legislative instrument is no longer amended in any respect; or

       * (ii) a compilation is still required but the compilation as registered ceases to represent the state of the law;

     * the First Parliamentary Counsel must: 

      * (d) if a compilation is no longer required--cause the Register to be annotated to explain why a compilation is no longer required; and

      * (e) if a compilation is still required but the compilation as registered ceases to represent the state of the law:

       * (i) cause the Register to be annotated to explain why the compilation as registered has ceased to represent the state of the law; and

       * (ii) cause to be registered, with effect from the date of the disallowance, a new compilation taking account of that disallowance.

     * (3) Subsections (1) and (2) do not require the registration of a compilation in relation to a principal legislative instrument until the registration of that principal legislative instrument occurs.

     * (2) If an Act amends a legislative instrument (the **_principal legislative instrument_**), the First Parliamentary Counsel may, by written notice given to the rulemaker of the principal legislative instrument, require the rulemaker to lodge a compilation, in electronic form, in relation to the principal legislative instrument.

     * (3) If:

      * (a) a compilation in relation to a legislative instrument (the **_principal legislative instrument_**) has been registered; and

      * (b) the First Parliamentary Counsel is satisfied that, because of the disallowance, in whole or in part, of a legislative instrument amending the principal legislative instrument, the compilation as registered has ceased to represent the state of the law;

     * the First Parliamentary Counsel may, by written notice given to the rulemaker of the legislative instrument that has been wholly or partly disallowed, require the rulemaker to lodge a revised compilation, in electronic form, in relation to the principal legislative instrument that takes account of the disallowance.

     * (4) A notice under subsection (1) must require the lodgment of the compilation concerned as soon as practicable after lodgment for registration of the amending legislative instrument or the principal legislative instrument, whichever last occurs.

     * (5) A notice given under subsection (2) because of an amendment of the principal legislative instrument made by a provision of an Act other than section 48C or 48D must require the lodgment of the compilation concerned as soon as practicable after the coming into force of the provision or provisions of the amending Act or the lodgment for registration of the principal legislative instrument, whichever last occurs.

     * (5A) A notice given under subsection (2) because of an amendment of the principal legislative instrument made by section 48C or 48D must require the lodgement of the compilation concerned as soon as practicable after the giving of the notice.

      * (a) a reference to the Act or legislative instrument by which each amendment was made to the principal legislative instrument;

      * (b) the amending history of each provision in the principal legislative instrument as amended by each Act or amending legislative instrument covered by the compilation;
