   * (3) If:

    * (a) an instrument to which this section applies is expressed to take effect before the day of its notification under subsection (5); but

    * (b) the instrument, or a provision of the instrument:

     * (i) would adversely affect the rights of a person (other than the Commonwealth or an authority of the Commonwealth) at a time before the instrument is notified; or

     * (ii) would result in the imposition of liabilities on a person (other than the Commonwealth or an authority of the Commonwealth) in respect of anything done, or omitted to be done, at a time before the instrument is notified;

   * the instrument or provision is taken to be of no effect in respect of the period before it is notified to the extent that it would have the effect described in subparagraph (b)(i) or (ii).

   * (6) If a notice of the making of an instrument is published in accordance with subsection (5), copies of the instrument must, at the time of publication of the notice or as soon as practicable thereafter, be made available for purchase at the place, or at each of the places, specified in the notice.

   * (8) Failure to comply with a requirement of subsection (6) or (7) in relation to any instrument does not constitute a failure to comply with subsection (5).
