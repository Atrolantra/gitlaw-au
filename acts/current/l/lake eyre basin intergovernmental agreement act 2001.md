##### AN AGREEMENT MADE THE 21ST DAY OF OCTOBER 2000

##### BETWEEN: 

##### THE COMMONWEALTH OF AUSTRALIA

##### AND

##### THE STATE OF QUEENSLAND

##### AND

##### THE STATE OF SOUTH AUSTRALIA

##### RECITALS: 

  * The Lake Eyre Basin has within its boundaries areas of national and international ecological and environmental significance, areas of high economic worth from activities such as pastoralism, tourism, oil and gas extraction and mining, and areas of social, cultural and heritage value, the sustainability of much of which depends upon the continued health of the Thomson/Barcoo/Cooper, Georgina and Diamantina river systems within Queensland and South Australia (as defined in the Australian National Map Drainage Divisions and Basins and including their catchments, flood plains, lakes, wetlands and overflow channels).

  * Management of the Lake Eyre Basin which will best serve the object of sustainability requires a joint cooperative approach between the States of Queensland and South Australia and the Commonwealth.

  * The Parties to this Agreement entered into a Heads of Agreement dated 26 May 1997 whereby it was agreed that the above approach should be embodied in a formal interstate Agreement ratified by the Parliaments of each State.

  * This Agreement is entered into by the Parties in accordance with the Lake Eyre Basin Heads of Agreement, and is to provide for the establishment of arrangements for the management of water and related natural resources for that portion of the Lake Eyre Basin identified as the Lake Eyre Basin Agreement Area in Clause 1.1, including the development or adoption, and implementation of agreed Policies and Strategies for the avoidance of adverse cross-border impacts and the creation of a relevant institutional structure.

  * This Agreement is also entered into in recognition of the provisions of the Intergovernmental Agreement on the Environment dated 1 May 1992 between the Commonwealth, all States and Territories, and the Australian Local Government Association, that States use their best endeavours to establish appropriate mechanisms for ensuring cooperative management where significant adverse external effects on another State are expected and identified, and that the role of government is to establish the policy, legislative and administrative framework to determine the permissibility of land use, resource use or development proposals having regard to the appropriate, efficient and ecologically sustainable use of natural resources, and to provide for the consideration of regional implications where proposals for the use of a resource affect several jurisdictions.

  * The provisions of this Agreement are consistent with the Council of Australian Governments' National Water Reform Framework and the Natural Heritage Trust Partnership Agreements.

  * **THE PARTIES AGREE AS FOLLOWS:**

**Part III - Guiding Principles**

    * **3.1	Consideration of all issues and the making of all decisions under this Agreement will be guided by the following Principles, namely that it be acknowledged:

      * (a) that the Lake Eyre Basin Agreement Area has important social, environmental, economic and cultural values which need to be conserved and promoted;

      * (b) that there are landscapes and watercourses in the Lake Eyre Basin Agreement Area that are valuable for aesthetic, wilderness, cultural and tourism purposes;

      * (c) that naturally variable flow regimes and the maintenance of water quality are fundamental to the health of the aquatic ecosystems in the Lake Eyre Basin Agreement Area;

      * (e) that flooding throughout the catchments within the Lake Eyre Basin Agreement Area is beneficial in that it makes a significant contribution to pastoral activities as well as flood plain ecosystem processes;

      * (f) that the storage and use of water both within and away from watercourses, and the storage and use of water from associated ground water, are all linked and should be considered together, and that water resources throughout catchments within the Lake Eyre Basin Agreement Area should be managed on an integrated basis;

      * (g) that precautionary approaches need to be taken so as to minimise the impact on known environmental attributes, and reduce the possibility of affecting poorly understood ecological functions;
