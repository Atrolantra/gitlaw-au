##### 31  Inspection

     * (a) authorise an authorised person to exercise the powers set out in subsection (1) of this section and section 32 in relation to the land, premises, vehicle, ship or aircraft; and

     * (b) the exercise of those powers is necessary to prevent the concealment, loss or destruction of the article or thing.

    * (7) However, subsection (6) does not apply unless the powers set out in subsection (1) of this section and section 32 are exercised in circumstances of such seriousness and urgency as to require and justify the immediate exercise of those powers without the authority of a warrant issued under subsection (4) of this section.

##### 31A  Nature of powers conferred on magistrates

    * (1) A power conferred on a magistrate by section 31 is conferred on the magistrate in a personal capacity and not as a court or a member of a court. The magistrate need not accept the power conferred.
