##### 54  Division does not apply in relation to acquisition of mortgage interests

    * This Division does not apply in relation to the acquisition of a mortgage interest.

##### 55  Amount of compensation--general principles

    * (1) The amount of compensation to which a person is entitled under this Part in respect of the acquisition of an interest in land is such amount as, having regard to all relevant matters, will justly compensate the person for the acquisition.

    * (2) In assessing the amount of compensation to which the person is entitled, regard shall be had to all relevant matters, including:

     * (a) except in a case to which paragraph (b) applies:

      * (i) the market value of the interest on the day of the acquisition;

      * (ii) the value, on the day of the acquisition, of any financial advantage, additional to market value, to the person incidental to the person's ownership of the interest;

      * (iii) any reduction in the market value of any other interest in land held by the person that is caused by the severance by the acquisition of the acquired interest from the other interest; and

      * (iv) where the acquisition has the effect of severing the acquired interest from another interest, any increase or decrease in the market value of the interest still held by the person resulting from the nature of, or the carrying out of, the purpose for which the acquired interest was acquired;

     * (b) if:

      * (i) the interest acquired from the person did not previously exist as such in relation to the land; and

      * (ii) the person's interest in the land was diminished, but not extinguished, by the acquisition;

     * the loss suffered by the person because of the diminution of the person's interest in the land;

     * (c) any loss, injury or damage suffered, or expense reasonably incurred, by the person that was, having regard to all relevant considerations, including any circumstances peculiar to the person, suffered or incurred by the person as a direct, natural and reasonable consequence of:

      * (i) the acquisition of the interest; or

      * (ii) the making or giving of the preacquisition declaration or certificate under section 24 in relation to the acquisition of the interest;

     * other than any such loss, injury, damage or expense in respect of which compensation is payable under Part VIII;

     * (d) if the interest is limited as to time or may be terminated by another person--the likelihood of the continuation or renewal of the interest and the likely terms and conditions on which any continuation or renewal would be granted;

     * (e) any legal or other professional costs reasonably incurred by the person in relation to the acquisition, including the costs of:

      * (i) obtaining advice in relation to the acquisition, the entitlement of the person to compensation or the amount of compensation; and

      * (ii) executing, producing or surrendering such documents, and making out and providing such abstracts and attested copies, as the Secretary of the Department requires.

##### 56  Meaning of market value

    * For the purposes of this Division, the market value of an interest in land at a particular time is the amount that would have been paid for the interest if it had been sold at that time by a willing but not anxious seller to a willing but not anxious buyer.

##### 57  Special provision where market value determined upon basis of potential of land

    * Where the market value of an interest in land acquired by compulsory process is assessed upon the basis that the land had potential to be used for a purpose other than the purpose for which it was used at the time of acquisition, compensation shall not be allowed in respect of any loss or damage that would necessarily have been suffered, or expense that would necessarily have been incurred, in realising that potential.

##### 58  No general market for interest acquired

    * (1) This section applies where:

     * (a) an interest in land (in this section called the **_old land_**) is acquired from a person by compulsory process;

     * (b) immediately before the acquisition, the person was using the old land, or intended to use the old land, for a purpose other than the carrying on of a business;

     * (c) but for the acquisition, the land would have been, or would have continued to be, used for that purpose;

     * (d) at the time of the acquisition, there was no general demand or market for land used for that purpose; and

     * (e) the person has acquired, or intends to acquire, another interest in other land (in this section called the **_new land_**) in substitution for the acquired interest and intends to use the new land for the same purpose.

    * (2) The market value of the acquired interest on the day of acquisition shall be taken to be the greater of:

     * (a) the amount that, apart from this section, would be the market value (if any) of that interest on that day; and

     * (b) the net acquisition cost in relation to the interest in the new land.

    * (3) The net acquisition cost, in relation to the interest in the new land, is the amount calculated in accordance with the formula:

    * where: 

    * **_CA_** is the amount of the cost, or the likely cost, to the person of the acquisition of the interest in the new land;

    * **_E_** is the amount of the expenses and losses incurred, or likely to be incurred, by the person as a result of, or incidental to, ceasing to use the old land and commencing to use the new land for the same purpose; and

    * **_FI_** is the present value of any real and substantial saving in recurring costs (relating to land or an interest in land) gained by the person as a result of the relocation.

    * (2) In determining the amount of compensation to which the person is entitled in respect of the acquisition of the interest:

     * (a) the limitation or restriction on the use of the land imposed by the planning instrument shall be disregarded;

     * (b) it shall be assumed that the land was subject only to such limitations and restrictions as would have been likely if there had been no proposal to limit or restrict the use of the land to use for the purpose permitted by the planning instrument; and

     * (c) the amount of any compensation paid or payable to the person in consequence of the planning instrument shall be deducted from the compensation to which the person would otherwise be entitled.

##### 60  Matters to be disregarded in assessing compensation

    * In assessing compensation, there shall be disregarded:

     * (a) any special suitability or adaptability of the relevant land for a purpose for which it could only be used pursuant to a power conferred by or under law, or for which it could only be used by a government, public or local authority;

     * (b) any increase in the value of the land caused by its use in a manner or for a purpose contrary to law;

     * (c) any increase or decrease in the value of the land caused by the carrying out of, or the proposal to carry out, the purpose for which the interest was acquired; and

     * (d) any increase in the value of the land caused by the carrying out, after a copy of the preacquisition declaration or certificate under section 24 in relation to the acquisition of the interest was given to the person, of any improvements to the land, unless the improvements were carried out with the written approval of the Minister.
