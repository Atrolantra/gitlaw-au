     *  	Alternatively, a person can be given an infringement notice under Part 3 of this Chapter in relation to a contravention of an offence of strict liability.

     *  	A person who is given an infringement notice can choose to pay an amount as an alternative to having court proceedings brought against the person for a contravention of an offence or civil penalty provision. If the person does not choose to pay the amount, proceedings can be brought against the person in relation to the contravention.

### Part 2--Civil penalty provisions

#### Division 1--Obtaining a civil penalty order

##### 85  Civil penalty orders

    * Application for order

    * (1) The Secretary may apply to the Federal Court for an order that a person, who is alleged to have contravened a civil penalty provision, pay the Commonwealth a pecuniary penalty.

    * (2) The Secretary must make the application within 6 years of the alleged contravention.

    * Court may order person to pay pecuniary penalty

    * (3) If the Federal Court is satisfied that the person has contravened the civil penalty provision, the court may order the person to pay to the Commonwealth such pecuniary penalty for the contravention as the court determines to be appropriate.

       * Note: Subsection (5) sets out the maximum penalty that the court may order the person to pay.

    * (4) An order under subsection (3) is a **_civil penalty order_**.

    * Determining pecuniary penalty

    * (5) The pecuniary penalty must not be more than:

     * (a) if the person is a body corporate--5 times the amount of the pecuniary penalty specified for the civil penalty provision; and

     * (b) otherwise--the amount of the pecuniary penalty specified for the civil penalty provision.

    * (6) In determining the pecuniary penalty, the court may take into account all relevant matters, including:

     * (a) the nature and extent of the contravention; and

     * (b) the nature and extent of any loss or damage suffered because of the contravention; and

     * (c) the circumstances in which the contravention took place; and

     * (d) whether the person has previously been found by a court in proceedings under one or more of the following to have engaged in any similar conduct:

      * (i) this Act;

      * (ii) the _Crimes Act 1914 _or the _Criminal Code _in relation to this Act.

##### 86  Civil enforcement of penalty

    * (1) A pecuniary penalty is a debt payable to the Commonwealth.

    * (2) The Commonwealth may enforce a civil penalty order as if it were an order made in civil proceedings against the person to recover a debt due by the person. The debt arising from the order is taken to be a judgement debt.

##### 87  Conduct contravening more than one civil penalty provision

    * (1) If conduct constitutes a contravention of 2 or more civil penalty provisions, proceedings may be instituted under this Part against a person in relation to the contravention of any one or more of those provisions.

    * (2) However, the person is not liable to more than one pecuniary penalty under this Part in relation to the same conduct.

##### 88  Multiple contraventions

    * (1) The Federal Court may make a single civil penalty order against a person for multiple contraventions of a civil penalty provision if proceedings for the contraventions are founded on the same facts, or if the contraventions form, or are part of, a series of contraventions of the same or a similar character.

    * (2) However, the penalty must not exceed the sum of the maximum penalties that could be ordered if a separate penalty were ordered for each of the contraventions.

##### 89  Proceedings may be heard together

    * The Federal Court may direct that 2 or more proceedings for civil penalty orders are to be heard together.

##### 90  Civil evidence and procedure rules for civil penalty orders

    * The Federal Court must apply the rules of evidence and procedure for civil matters when hearing proceedings for a civil penalty order.

##### 91  Contravening a civil penalty provision is not an offence

    * A contravention of a civil penalty provision is not an offence.

#### Division 2--Civil proceedings and criminal proceedings

##### 92  Civil proceedings after criminal proceedings

    * The Federal Court may not make a civil penalty order against a person for a contravention of a civil penalty provision if the person has been convicted of an offence constituted by conduct that is the same, or substantially the same, as the conduct constituting the contravention.

##### 93  Criminal proceedings during civil proceedings

    * (1) Proceedings for a civil penalty order against a person for a contravention of a civil penalty provision are stayed if:

     * (a) criminal proceedings are commenced or have already been commenced against the person for an offence; and

     * (b) the offence is constituted by conduct that is the same, or substantially the same, as the conduct alleged to constitute the contravention.

    * (2) The proceedings for the order (the **_civil proceedings_**) may be resumed if the person is not convicted of the offence. Otherwise, the civil proceedings are dismissed.

##### 94  Criminal proceedings after civil proceedings

    * Criminal proceedings may be commenced against a person for conduct that is the same, or substantially the same, as conduct that would constitute a contravention of a civil penalty provision regardless of whether a civil penalty order has been made against the person in relation to the contravention.

##### 95  Evidence given in civil proceedings not admissible in criminal proceedings

    * (1) Evidence of information given, or evidence of production of documents, by an individual is not admissible in criminal proceedings against the individual if:

     * (a) the individual previously gave the evidence or produced the documents in proceedings for a civil penalty order against the individual for an alleged contravention of a civil penalty provision (whether or not the order was made); and

     * (b) the conduct alleged to constitute the offence is the same, or substantially the same, as the conduct alleged to constitute the contravention.

    * (2) However, subsection (1) does not apply to criminal proceedings in relation to the falsity of the evidence given by the individual in the proceedings for the civil penalty order.

#### Division 3--Miscellaneous

##### 96  Ancillary contravention of civil penalty provisions

    * (1) A person must not:

     * (d) be in any way, directly or indirectly, knowingly concerned in, or party to, a contravention of a civil penalty provision; or

     * (e) conspire with others to effect a contravention of a civil penalty provision.

    * Civil penalty

    * (2) A person who contravenes subsection (1) in relation to a civil penalty provision is taken to have contravened the provision.

##### 97  Mistake of fact

    * (1) A person is not liable to have a civil penalty order made against the person for a contravention of a civil penalty provision if:

     * (a) at or before the time of the conduct constituting the contravention, the person:

      * (i) considered whether or not facts existed; and

      * (ii) was under a mistaken but reasonable belief about those facts; and

     * (b) had those facts existed, the conduct would not have constituted a contravention of the civil penalty provision.

    * (2) For the purposes of subsection (1), a person may be regarded as having considered whether or not facts existed if:

     * (a) the person had considered, on a previous occasion, whether those facts existed in the circumstances surrounding that occasion; and

     * (b) the person honestly and reasonably believed that the circumstances surrounding the present occasion were the same, or substantially the same, as those surrounding the previous occasion.

    * (3) A person who wishes to rely on subsection (1) or (2) in proceedings for a civil penalty order bears an evidential burden in relation to that matter.

##### 98  State of mind

    * (1) In proceedings for a civil penalty order against a person for a contravention of a civil penalty provision (other than subsection 96(1)), it is not necessary to prove:

     * (a) the person's intention; or

     * (b) the person's knowledge; or

     * (c) the person's recklessness; or

     * (d) the person's negligence; or

     * (e) any other state of mind of the person.

    * (2) Subsection (1) of this section does not affect the operation of section 97 (mistake of fact).

##### 99  Civil penalty provisions contravened by employees, agents or officers

    * If an element of a civil penalty provision is done by an employee, agent or officer of a body corporate acting within the actual or apparent scope of his or her employment, or within his or her actual or apparent authority, the element must also be attributed to the body corporate.
