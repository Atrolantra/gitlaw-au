##### 19  Cancellation

     * (c) the person has requested that the person's trade support loan be cancelled.

#### Division 4--Payment

##### 22  Payment by instalments

    * (1) Trade support loan is to be paid by instalments.

    * (2) The Secretary must pay an instalment of trade support loan to a person, in relation to an instalment period of the person, if:

    * (3) The instalment is to be paid to the person on the day after the end of the instalment period that is determined by the Secretary to be the earliest day on which it is reasonably practicable to make the payment.

        * Note: For example, if instalment periods are a month, the divisor is 12.

    * (2) The amount of an instalment worked out under subsection (1) is reduced as necessary to ensure that trade support loan totalling more than the lifetime limit is not to be paid to a person.

    * (3) If the amount of an instalment would be:

     * (a) one or more whole dollars and a part of a cent; or

     * (b) one or more whole dollars and cents and a part of a cent;

    * the amount is to be increased or decreased (increased, in the case of half a cent) to the nearest whole cent.

    * (4) If, apart from this subsection, the amount of an instalment would be less than $1.00, the amount is to be increased to $1.00.

     * (a) if the person is undertaking the first year of an apprenticeship on the final day of an instalment period--$8,000; and

     * (b) if the person is undertaking the second year of an apprenticeship on the final day of an instalment period--$6,000; and

     * (c) if the person is undertaking the third year of an apprenticeship on the final day of an instalment period--$4,000; and

     * (d) if the person is undertaking the fourth (or later) year of an apprenticeship on the final day of an instalment period--$2,000.

        * Note: The yearly rates are indexed on 1 July 2017 and each later 1 July in line with increases in the consumer price index (see section 99).

    * (2) The rules may prescribe one or more ways of determining, or criteria to be considered in determining, the year of an apprenticeship a person is undertaking on any particular day.

##### 25  Payment into bank account

## Chapter 3--Loan repayments

### Part 3.1--Incurring debts

#### Division 1--Simplified outline of this Part

##### 26  Simplified outline of this Part

    * Trade support loan that is paid to a person must be repaid by the person through the tax system, after the person's income reaches a certain threshold.

    * Each time a person receives an instalment of trade support loan, the person incurs a debt called a TSL debt (except in certain circumstances when the loan is recoverable as an overpayment debt under Part 4.3 of this Act).

    * Each TSL debt is incorporated into the person's accumulated TSL debt. This accumulated TSL debt forms the basis for working out the amounts the person is obliged to repay.

#### Division 2--TSL debts

##### 27  TSL debts

    * (1) If an instalment of trade support loan is paid to a person, the person incurs, on the day the instalment is paid, a TSL debt to the Commonwealth of an amount equal to the amount of the instalment.

    * (2) Subsection (1) does not apply to an instalment or part of an instalment if the amount of the instalment or part is an overpayment debt.

##### 28  TSL debt discharged by death

    * Upon the death of a person who owes a TSL debt to the Commonwealth, the debt is taken to have been paid.

        * Note: TSL debts are not provable in bankruptcy: see subsection 82(3AB) of the _Bankruptcy Act 1966_.

##### 29  Notice to Commissioner

    * (1) If a person incurs a TSL debt, the Secretary must give the Commissioner a notice specifying the amount of the debt incurred by the person.

    * (2) The Secretary may include in the notice any other details the Commissioner requests for the purpose of ensuring the Commissioner has the information needed to exercise powers or perform functions of the Commissioner under this Act.

#### Division 3--Accumulated TSL debts

##### 30  Simplified outline of this Division

    * There are 2 stages to working out a person's accumulated TSL debt for a financial year.

    * In stage 1, the person's former accumulated TSL debt is worked out by adjusting the preceding financial year's accumulated TSL debt to take account of:

      * (a) indexation using the TSL debt indexation factor; and

      * (b) the debts that the person incurs during the last 6 months of the preceding financial year; and

      * (c) any completion discount for the person; and

      * (d) voluntary TSL repayments of the debt; and

      * (e) compulsory TSL repayment amounts in respect of the debt.

    * In stage 2, the person's accumulated TSL debt is worked out from:

      * (a) the person's former accumulated TSL debt; and

      * (b) the TSL debts that the person incurs during the first 6 months of the financial year; and

      * (c) any completion discount for the person; and

      * (d) voluntary TSL repayments of the debt.

##### 31  Stage 1--working out a former accumulated TSL debt

    * (1) A person's **_former accumulated TSL debt_**, in relation to the person's accumulated TSL debt for a financial year, is worked out by multiplying:

     * (a) the amount worked out using the following method statement; by

     * (b) the TSL debt indexation factor for 1 June in that financial year.

Method statement

      * Step 1.	Take the person's accumulated TSL debt for the immediately preceding financial year. (This amount is taken to be zero if the person has no accumulated TSL debt for that financial year.)

      * Step 2.	Add the sum of all of the TSL debts (if any) that the person incurred during the last 6 months of the immediately preceding financial year.

      * Step 3.	Subtract the amount of the completion discount for the person, if the Secretary notified the Commissioner of a completion discount for the person under section 40 during the period:

        * (a) starting on 1 June in the immediately preceding financial year; and

        * (b) ending immediately before the next 1 June.

      * Step 4.	Subtract the sum of the amounts by which the person's debts referred to in steps 1 and 2 are reduced because of any voluntary TSL repayments that have been made during the period:

        * (a) starting on 1 June in the immediately preceding financial year; and

        * (b) ending immediately before the next 1 June.

      * Step 5.	Subtract the sum of all of the person's compulsory TSL repayment amounts that:

        * (a) were assessed during that period (excluding any assessed as a result of a return given before that period); or

        * (b) were assessed after the end of that period as a result of a return given before the end of that period.

      * Step 6.	Subtract the sum of the amounts by which any compulsory TSL repayment amount of the person is increased (whether as a result of an increase in the person's taxable income of an income year or otherwise) by an amendment of an assessment made during that period.

      * Step 7.	Add the sum of the amounts by which any compulsory TSL repayment amount of the person is reduced (whether as a result of a reduction in the person's taxable income of an income year or otherwise) by an amendment of an assessment made during that period.

    * (2) For the purposes of this section, an assessment, or an amendment of an assessment, is taken to have been made on the day specified in the notice of assessment, or notice of amended assessment, as the date of issue of that notice.

##### 32  TSL debt indexation factor

    * (1) The **_TSL debt indexation factor_** for 1 June in a financial year is the number (rounded to 3 decimal places) worked out as follows:

Method statement

      * Step 1.	Add:

        * (a) the index number for the quarter ending on 31 March in that financial year; and

        * (b) the index numbers for the 3 quarters that immediately preceded that quarter.

      * Step 2.	Add:

        * (a) the index number for the quarter ending on 31 March in the immediately preceding financial year; and

        * (b) the index numbers for the 3 quarters that immediately preceded that quarter.

      * Step 3.	The **_TSL debt indexation factor_** for 1 June in the financial year is the result of step 1 divided by the result of step 2.

    * (2) For the purposes of rounding a TSL debt indexation factor, the third decimal place is rounded up if, apart from the rounding:

     * (a) the factor would have 4 or more decimal places; and

     * (b) the fourth decimal place would be a number greater than 4.

##### 33  Index numbers

    * (1) The **_index number_** for a quarter is the All Groups Consumer Price Index number, being the weighted average of the 8 capital cities, published by the Australian Statistician in respect of that quarter.

    * (2) Subject to subsection (3), if, at any time before or after the commencement of this Act:

     * (a) the Australian Statistician has published or publishes an index number in respect of a quarter; and

     * (b) that index number is in substitution for an index number previously published by the Australian Statistician in respect of that quarter;

    * disregard the publication of the later index number for the purposes of this section.

    * (3) If, at any time before or after the commencement of this Act, the Australian Statistician has changed or changes the index reference period for the All Groups Consumer Price Index, then, in applying this section after the change took place or takes place, have regard only to index numbers published in terms of the new index reference period.

##### 34  Publishing TSL debt indexation factors

    * The Commissioner must cause to be published before 1 June in each financial year the TSL debt indexation factor for that 1 June.

##### 35  Stage 2--working out an accumulated TSL debt

    * (1) A person's **_accumulated TSL debt_**, for a financial year, is worked out as follows:

    * where: 

    * **_completion discount _**means any completion discount for the person notified by the Secretary to the Commissioner under section 40 on or after 1 July in the financial year and before 1 June in that year.

    * **_former accumulated TSL debt_** is the person's former accumulated TSL debt in relation to that accumulated TSL debt.

    * **_TSL debt repayments_** is the sum of all of the voluntary TSL repayments (if any) paid, on or after 1 July in the financial year and before 1 June in that year, in reduction of the TSL debts incurred in that year.

    * **_TSL debts incurred_** is the sum of the amounts of all of the TSL debts (if any) that the person incurred during the first 6 months of the financial year.

    * (2) The person incurs the accumulated TSL debt on 1 June in the financial year.

##### 36  Rounding of amounts

    * (1) If, apart from this section, a person's accumulated TSL debt would be an amount consisting of a number of whole dollars and a number of cents, disregard the number of cents.

    * (2) If, apart from this section, a person's accumulated TSL debt would be an amount of less than $1.00, the person's accumulated TSL debt is taken to be zero.

##### 37  Accumulated TSL debt discharges earlier debts

    * (1) The accumulated TSL debt that a person incurs on 1 June in a financial year discharges, or discharges the unpaid part of:

     * (a) any TSL debt that the person incurred during the calendar year immediately preceding that day; and

     * (b) any accumulated TSL debt that the person incurred on the immediately preceding 1 June.

    * (2) Nothing in subsection (1) affects the application of Division 2 or sections 31 and 35.

##### 38  Accumulated TSL debt discharged by death

    * (1) Upon the death of a person who has an accumulated TSL debt, the accumulated TSL debt is taken to be discharged.

    * (2) To avoid doubt, this section does not affect any compulsory TSL repayment amounts required to be paid in respect of the accumulated TSL debt, whether or not those amounts were assessed before the person's death.

        * Note: Accumulated TSL debts are not provable in bankruptcy: see subsection 82(3AB) of the _Bankruptcy Act 1966_.

### Part 3.2--Discharging debts

#### Division 1--Simplified outline of this Part

##### 39  Simplified outline of this Part

    * Trade support loan that is paid to a person must be repaid. Compulsory repayments start once the person's income reaches the minimum repayment income under the _Higher Education Support Act 2003_ and the person has finished repaying any accumulated HELP debt under that Act.

    * If the person successfully completes a qualifying apprenticeship, the person's debts will be partially discharged by an amount called the completion discount. The completion discount is 20% of the total amount of instalments of trade support loan that were paid to the person.

    * As well as the completion discount, the person's debt is discharged by:

      * (a) any repayments the person chooses to make at any time (voluntary repayments); and

      * (b) repayments the person must make after the person's income reaches the minimum repayment income (compulsory repayments).

    * The Commissioner makes assessments of compulsory repayments, which are collected in the same way as amounts of income tax and compulsory repayments of accumulated HELP debts.

#### Division 2--Completion discount

##### 40  Completion discount

    * (1) If a designated State/Territory training authority notifies the Secretary that a person has successfully completed a qualifying apprenticeship, the Secretary must give the Commissioner a notice specifying the discount (the **_completion discount_**) determined for the person in accordance with subsection (2).

    * (2) The person's completion discount is the amount equal to 20% of the total amount of instalments of trade support loan that were paid to the person in relation to instalment periods that ended:

     * (a) before the person ceased to be undertaking the qualifying apprenticeship; and

     * (b) if a notice under subsection (1) has previously been given in respect of an earlier qualifying apprenticeship undertaken by the person--after the person completed the earlier qualifying apprenticeship.

    * (3) The rules may prescribe any of the following as a **_designated State/Territory training authority_**:

     * (a) a State;

     * (b) a Territory;

     * (c) an authority of a State or Territory.

##### 41  Application of completion discount

    * If the Secretary notifies the Commissioner of a completion discount for a person under section 40, the amount of the completion discount is to be applied as follows:

     * (a) first, in discharge or reduction of any accumulated TSL debt of the person;

     * (b) second, in discharge or reduction of:

      * (i) any TSL debt of the person; or

      * (ii) if there is more than one such debt, those debts in the order in which they were incurred.

##### 42  Refunding of payments

    * (2) If the person has not given any directions, or the directions given do not adequately deal with the matter, any money available is to be applied as follows:

     * (a) first, in discharge or reduction of any accumulated TSL debt of the person;

     * (b) second, in discharge or reduction of:

      * (i) any TSL debt of the person; or

      * (ii) if there is more than one such debt, those debts in the order in which they were incurred.

##### 45  Refunding of payments

    * If: 

     * (a) a person pays an amount to the Commonwealth under this Division; and

### Part 4.3--Overpayment debts

##### 89  Simplified outline of this Part

    * Usually, trade support loan that is paid to a person must be repaid through the tax system in accordance with Part 3.2, after the person's income reaches a certain threshold. However, in certain situations where trade support loan is wrongly paid to a person, the amount becomes a debt under this Part called an overpayment debt.

    * Overpayment debts can be recovered through the courts, or under an arrangement the Commonwealth might enter into with the person.

##### 90  Overpayment debt

    * (1) If:

     * (a) a payment of trade support loan is made to a person; and

     * (b) a person who obtains the benefit of the payment was not entitled for any reason to obtain that benefit;

    * the amount of the payment is a debt (an **_overpayment debt_**) due to the Commonwealth by the person and the debt is taken to have arisen when the person obtained the benefit of the payment.

    * (2) Without limiting subsection (1), a person is taken not to have been entitled to obtain the benefit of the payment if the payment should not have been made for any of the following reasons:

     * (a) the payment was made to the person by mistake as a result of a computer error or an administrative error;

     * (b) the person for whose benefit the payment was intended to be made was not qualified to receive the payment;

     * (c) the payment was not payable;

     * (d) the payment was made as a result of a contravention of this Act, a false statement or a misrepresentation;

     * (e) the payment was made in purported compliance with a direction or authority given by the person who was entitled to obtain the benefit of the payment but the direction or authority had been revoked or withdrawn before the payment was made;

     * (f) the payment was intended to be made for the benefit of someone else who died before the payment was made.

    * (3) Without limiting subsection (1), a person is taken not to have been entitled to obtain the benefit of so much of any payment made to the person for an instalment period in accordance with a determination under subsection 16(4) as exceeds the amount of the instalment that was payable to the person for that instalment period having regard to section 24 (yearly rate).

    * (4) If the payment is made to, or as directed or authorised by, the person who is entitled to obtain the benefit of the payment, subsection (1) does not apply to any other person who afterwards obtains the benefit of the payment unless the other person obtained the benefit because of a mistake made by the first person in connection with the giving of the direction or authorisation.

    * (5) Subsection (1) applies in relation to a payment made to a person whether or not the payment was made under a determination that had effect at the time when the payment was made.

    * (3) The Secretary may vary or terminate the arrangement:

     * (a) at the debtor's request; or

     * (b) after giving the debtor 28 days' notice of the proposed variation or termination; or

     * (c) if the Secretary is satisfied that the debtor has failed to disclose material information about the debtor's true capacity to repay the debt--without notice.

##### 93  Recovery of overpayment debt--legal proceedings

    * An overpayment debt is recoverable by the Commonwealth in a court of competent jurisdiction.

##### 94  Secretary may write off overpayment debt

    * (1) Subject to subsection (2), the Secretary may, on behalf of the Commonwealth, decide to write off an overpayment debt, for a stated period or otherwise.

    * (2) The Secretary may decide to write off an overpayment debt under subsection (1) if, and only if:

     * (a) the debt is irrecoverable at law; or

     * (b) the debtor has no capacity to repay the debt; or

     * (c) the debtor's whereabouts are unknown after all reasonable efforts have been made to locate the debtor; or

     * (d) it is not cost effective to take action to recover the debt.

    * (3) For the purposes of paragraph (2)(a), an overpayment debt is irrecoverable at law if, and only if:

     * (a) the debt cannot be recovered by means of legal proceedings because the period during which such proceedings may be brought has ended; or

     * (b) there is no proof of the debt capable of sustaining legal proceedings for its recovery; or

     * (c) the debtor is discharged from bankruptcy and the debt was incurred before the debtor became bankrupt and was not incurred by fraud; or

     * (d) the debtor has died leaving no estate or insufficient funds in the debtor's estate to repay the debt.

    * (4) A decision made under subsection (1) takes effect on the date of effect specified in the decision (which may be earlier or later than the day the decision is made).

    * (5) Nothing in this section prevents anything being done at any time to recover a debt that has been written off under this section.

##### 95  Secretary's power to waive overpayment debt

    * (1) The Secretary may, on behalf of the Commonwealth, waive the Commonwealth's right to recover the whole or part of an overpayment debt from a debtor only in the circumstances described in section 96 or 97.

    * (2) A waiver takes effect on the date of effect specified in the waiver (which may be earlier or later than the day the decision to waive is made).

        * Note: If the Secretary waives the Commonwealth's right to recover all or part of a debt, this is a permanent bar to recovery of the debt or part of the debt--the debt or part of the debt effectively ceases to exist.

##### 96  Waiver of overpayment debt arising from error

    * (1) If subsection (2) applies in relation to an overpayment debt, the Secretary must waive the right to recover so much of the debt as is attributable solely to an administrative error made by:

     * (a) the Commonwealth; or

     * (b) an authority of the Commonwealth; or

     * (c) an organisation that performs services for the Commonwealth.

    * (2) This subsection applies in relation to an overpayment debt if the debt is raised after the end of whichever of the following periods ends later:

     * (a) the period of 6 weeks from the first payment that caused the debt;

     * (b) if the debt arose because a person has complied with a notification obligation--the period of 6 weeks from the end of the notification period.

    * The Secretary must waive the right to recover an overpayment debt if: 

     * (a) the debt is, or is likely to be, less than $200; and

     * (b) it is not cost effective for the Commonwealth to take action to recover the debt.

## Chapter 5--Miscellaneous

##### 99  Indexation of lifetime limit and yearly rate

    * (1) Each of the following amounts:

     * (a) the lifetime limit;

     * (b) a yearly rate;

    * is to be indexed, on 1 July 2017 and each later 1 July (each such 1 July is an **_indexation day_**), in accordance with this section.

    * (2) If an amount is to be indexed on an indexation day, this Act has effect as if the indexed amount were substituted for that amount on that day.

    * (3) This is how to work out the indexed amount for an amount that is to be indexed on an indexation day:

Method statement

      * Step 1.	Use subsection (4) to work out the annual indexation factor for the amount on the indexation day.

      * Step 2.	Multiply the amount that is to be indexed by the annual indexation factor.

      * Step 3.	If the result of step 2 is an amount of whole dollars, the result is the **_indexed amount_**. If the result of step 2 is an amount of whole dollars and cents, round the amount up or down (up in the case of 50 cents) to the nearest dollar. The result is the **_indexed amount_**.

    * (4) Subject to subsections (5) and (6), the **_annual indexation factor_** for an amount that is to be indexed under this section on an indexation day is:

    * rounded to 3 decimal places.

    * (5) For the purposes of subsection (4):

     * (a) in identifying the highest March quarter, disregard any March quarter that is earlier than the 2014 March quarter; and

     * (b) the third decimal place is rounded up if, apart from the rounding:

      * (i) the factor would have 4 or more decimal places; and

      * (ii) the fourth decimal place would be a number greater than 4.

        * Note: See section 33 for the definition of **_index number_**.

    * (6) If an annual indexation factor worked out under subsections (4) and (5) would be less than 1, the indexation factor is to be increased to 1.

##### 100  Application to under18s

    * (1) Each of the following applies to a person aged under 18 in the same way that it applies to a person aged 18 or older:

##### 103  Annual report
