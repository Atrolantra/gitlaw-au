### An Act to impose a termination payments tax and to declare the rate of the tax


    * 1**  Short title **[_see_ Note 1]

    * This Act may be cited as the _Termination Payments Tax Imposition Act 1997_.

    * 2**  Commencement **[_see_ Note 1]

    * This Act commences on the day on which it receives the Royal Assent.

##### 3  Interpretation

    * Expressions used in this Act that are defined by the _Termination Payments Tax (Assessment and Collection) Act 1997_ have the same meanings as in that Act.

##### 4  Imposition of termination payments surcharge

    * The termination payments surcharge that is payable on a termination payment made to or for a taxpayer under the _Termination Payments Tax (Assessment and Collection) Act 1997_ is imposed by this Act.

      * Note: Surcharge is not payable on a termination payment made on or after 1 July 2005--see subsection 7(2) of the _Termination Payments Tax (Assessment and Collection) Act 1997_.

##### 5  Rate of termination payments surcharge

    * (1AA) In this section:

    * **_higher income amount_** means:

     * (a) for the 2003-2004 financial year--$114,981; and

     * (b) for the 2004-2005 financial year--that amount as indexed under section 6.

    * **_lower income amount_** means:

     * (a) for the 2003-2004 financial year--$94,691; and

     * (b) for the 2004-2005 financial year--that amount as indexed under section 6.

    * **_maximum surcharge percentage_** means:

     * (a) for the 2003-2004 financial year--14.5%; and

     * (b) for the 2004-2005 financial year--12.5%.

    * (1) If the taxpayer's adjusted taxable income for a financial year (**_relevant adjusted taxable income_**) is not less than the lower income amount but is less than the higher income amount, the rate of the termination payments surcharge payable on a termination payment made to or for the taxpayer in that year is the percentage (calculated to 5 decimal places) of the amount of the payment worked out using the formula:



    * where: 

    * **_A_** is:



    * (1A) If the percentage calculated under subsection (1) for a financial year would, if it were worked out to 6 decimal places, end with a number greater than 4, the number so calculated is increased by 0.00001.

    * (2) If the taxpayer's adjusted taxable income for a financial year is equal to, or greater than, the higher income amount, the rate of the termination payments surcharge payable in respect of a termination payment made to or for the taxpayer in that year is the maximum surcharge percentage of the amount of the payment.

##### 6  Indexation

    * _Indexation of certain amounts for 2004-05 financial year_

    * _	(1)	Section 5 applies in relation to an indexing financial year as if each indexable amount were replaced by the amount worked out using the formula:



    * where: 

    * **_previous indexable amount_** means the indexable amount for the financial year immediately before the indexing financial year.

    * **_relevant indexation factor_** means the indexation factor for the indexing financial year.

    * _Rounding off of indexed amounts_

    * _	(2)	If an amount worked out under subsection (1) is an amount of dollars and cents:

     * (a) if the number of cents is less than 50--the amount is to be rounded down to the nearest whole dollar; or

     * (b) otherwise--the amount is to be rounded up to the nearest whole dollar.

    * _Indexation factor_

    * _	(3)	The **_indexation factor_** for an indexing financial year is the number calculated, to 3 decimal places, using the formula:



    * where: 

    * **_current March year_** means the period of 12 months ending on 31 March immediately before the indexing financial year.

    * **_previous March year_** means the period of 12 months immediately before the current March year.

    * _Rounding up of indexation factor_

    * _	(4)	If the number calculated under subsection (3) for a financial year would, if it were worked out to 4 decimal places, end with a number greater than 4, the number so calculated is increased by 0.001.

    * _Change in index numbers_

    * _	(5)	If, at any time, whether before or after the commencement of this Act, the Australian Statistician has published or publishes an index number for a quarter in substitution for an index number previously published for the quarter, the publication of the later index number is to be disregarded.

    * _Indexable amounts to be published_

    * _	(6)	The Commissioner must publish before, or as soon as practicable after, the start of the 2004-05 financial year the indexable amounts as replaced under subsection (1) for that year.

    * _Definitions_

    * _	(7)	In this section:

    * **_indexable amount_** means:

     * (a) an amount stated in section 5; or

     * (b) if that amount has previously been altered under this section--the altered amount.

    * **_indexing financial year_** means the 2004-05 financial year.

    * **_index number_**, for a quarter, means the estimate of full-time adult average weekly ordinary time earnings for the middle month of the quarter published by the Australian Statistician.

      * Note: For the purposes of this section, **_Australian Statistician_** means the Australian Statistician referred to in subsection 5(2) of the _Australian Bureau of Statistics Act 1975_.
