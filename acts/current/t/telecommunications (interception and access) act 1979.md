    * (1) If an agency could apply for a warrant under section 46 (authorising interceptions of communications to or from a service), it may instead apply for a warrant under this section that also authorises entry on premises.

      * (ii) where, if the warrant were issued under section 46, communications to or from the telecommunications service would be intercepted while passing over a telecommunications system operated by a carrier--execution of the warrant as a result of action taken by employees of that carrier might jeopardise security of the investigation by the agency of a serious offence in which a person to whom the application relates is involved;

     * it would be impracticable or inappropriate to intercept communications under a warrant in respect of the service otherwise than by the use of equipment or a line installed on those premises;

    * subsections (4) and (5) apply.

    * (4) The Judge or nominated AAT member may issue a warrant under this section authorising:

     * (a) entry on those premises in order to install, maintain, use or recover equipment or a line used in the interception of communications being made to or from the service; and

     * (a) if subparagraph 46(1)(d)(ii) applies--up to 45 days; or

     * (b) otherwise--up to 90 days.

    * (4) A Judge or nominated AAT member shall not vary a warrant by extending the period for which it is to be in force.

    * (5) Neither of subsections (3) and (4) prevents the issue of a further warrant in respect of a service, or a person, in respect of which a warrant has, or warrants have, previously been issued.

    * (7) A warrant shall set out short particulars of each serious offence in relation to which the Judge or nominated AAT member issuing the warrant was satisfied, on the application for the warrant, as mentioned in:

     * (a) in the case of a warrant under section 48--paragraph 46(1)(d); or

## Chapter 3--Preserving and accessing stored communications

### Part 31A--Preserving stored communications

#### Division 1--Outline of this Part

##### 107G  Outline of this Part

    * This Part establishes a system of preserving certain stored communications that are held by a carrier. The purpose of the preservation is to prevent the communications from being destroyed before they can be accessed under certain warrants issued under this Act.

    * Under the system, certain agencies can give a preservation notice to a carrier requiring the carrier to preserve all stored communications that the carrier holds that relate to the person or telecommunications service specified in the notice. The carrier will breach its obligations under section 313 of the _Telecommunications Act 1997_ if it does not comply with the notice.

    *  There are 2 types of preservation notices: domestic preservation notices (which cover stored communications that might relate either to a contravention of certain Australian laws or to security) and foreign preservation notices (which cover stored communications that might relate to a contravention of certain foreign laws).

    * Division 2 deals with domestic preservation notices. There are 2 kinds of domestic preservation notices:

     * (a) historic domestic preservation notices, which cover stored communications held by the carrier on a particular day; and

     * (b) ongoing domestic preservation notices, which cover stored communications held by the carrier in a particular 30day period.

    * An issuing agency (which is an enforcement agency or the Organisation for an historic domestic preservation notice, and an interception agency or the Organisation for an ongoing domestic preservation notice) can only give a domestic preservation notice if the conditions in section 107J are satisfied. There are certain grounds on which the notice must be revoked (see section 107L).

    * Division 3 deals with foreign preservation notices. Foreign preservation notices, like historic domestic preservation notices, cover stored communications held by the carrier on a particular day. Only the Australian Federal Police can give a foreign preservation notice to a carrier and it can only do so if a foreign country has made a request for the preservation in accordance with section 107P. There are certain grounds on which the notice must be revoked (see section 107R).

    * Division 4 has miscellaneous provisions relating to both domestic and foreign preservation notices (such as provisions about the giving of evidentiary certificates by carriers and issuing agencies).

    * The Ombudsman has functions in relation to preservation notices given by issuing agencies (other than the Organisation) and the InspectorGeneral of Intelligence and Security has functions in relation to preservation notices given by the Organisation.

#### Division 2--Domestic preservation notices

##### 107H  Domestic preservation notices

    * (1) An issuing agency may give a carrier a written notice (a **_domestic preservation notice_**) requiring the carrier to preserve, while the notice is in force, all stored communications that:

     * (a) Division 1 has been complied with in relation to the application; and

     * (b) in the case of a telephone application--because of urgent circumstances, it was necessary to make the application by telephone; and

     * (c) there are reasonable grounds for suspecting that a particular carrier holds stored communications:

      * (i) that the person has made; or

      * (ii) that another person has made and for which the person is the intended recipient; and

     * (e) how much the use of such methods would be likely to assist in connection with the investigation by the agency of the serious contravention; and

     * (f) how much the use of such methods would be likely to prejudice the investigation by the agency of the serious contravention, whether because of delay or for any other reason.

    * (2A) In the case of a mutual assistance application, the matters to which the issuing authority must have regard are:

     * (a) how much the privacy of any person or persons would be likely to be interfered with by accessing those stored communications under a stored communications warrant; and

     * (b) the gravity of the conduct constituting the serious foreign contravention; and

     * (c) how much the information referred to in subparagraph (1)(d)(ii) would be likely to assist in connection with the investigation, to the extent that this is possible to determine from information obtained from the foreign country to which the application relates.

## Chapter 5--Cooperation with agencies

### Part 51--Definitions

##### 187  Definitions

    * (1) This section sets out the meaning of the following 2 important concepts used in this Chapter:

     * (a) interception capability (relating to obligations under Part 53);

     * (b) delivery capability (relating to obligations under Part 55).

    * These concepts do not overlap.

    * Interception capability

    * (2) In this Chapter, **_interception capability_**, in relation to a particular kind of telecommunications service that involves, or will involve, the use of a telecommunications system, means the capability of that kind of service or of that system to enable:

     * (a) a communication passing over the system to be intercepted; and

     * (b) lawfully intercepted information to be transmitted to the delivery points applicable in respect of that kind of service.

    * Delivery capability

    * (3) In this Chapter, **_delivery capability_**, in relation to a particular kind of telecommunications service that involves, or will involve, the use of a telecommunications system, means the capability of that kind of service or of that system to enable lawfully intercepted information to be delivered to interception agencies from the delivery points applicable in respect of that kind of service.

### Part 52--Delivery points

##### 188  Delivery points

    * (1) Each carrier must:

     * (a) nominate, in respect of a particular kind of telecommunications service of that carrier and in respect of each interception agency, at least one place in Australia as the location of a point from which lawfully intercepted information can most conveniently be transmitted in relation to that interception agency; and

     * (b) inform the Communications Access Coordinator of the place or places nominated for each interception agency.

        * Note 1: The nominated location becomes a delivery point: see the definition of **_delivery point _**in subsection 5(1).

        * Note 2: The definition of **_carrier _**in subsection 5(1) includes carriage service providers.

        * Note 3: Delivery points are significant for the interception capability obligations in Part 53 and for the delivery capability obligations in Part 55.

    * Disagreement over delivery points

    * (2) The Communications Access Coordinator may, at any time, notify a carrier that an interception agency does not agree to the location of a point nominated under subsection (1) by that carrier in respect of a particular kind of telecommunications service and of that interception agency.

    * (3) Upon being so notified, the carrier must nominate another location of a point in respect of that kind of telecommunications service and of that interception agency and inform the Communications Access Coordinator.

        * Note: The nominated location becomes a delivery point: see the definition of **_delivery point _**in subsection 5(1).

    * (4) If the location of a point nominated under subsection (3) is still unsatisfactory to the interception agency, the Communications Access Coordinator must:

     * (a) inform the carrier to that effect; and

     * (b) refer the disagreement to the ACMA for a determination under subsection (5).

    * (5) The ACMA, after hearing the views of the carrier and the views of the interception agency concerning the best location of a point in relation to that kind of telecommunications service and that interception agency, must determine the location of a point for the purposes of this section.

        * Note: The determined location becomes a delivery point: see the definition of **_delivery point _**in subsection 5(1).

    * Factors to be considered in determining delivery points

    * (6) In determining the location of a delivery point, the carrier and the interception agency or, failing agreement, the ACMA, must have regard to:

     * (a) the configuration of the kind of telecommunications service in respect of which the delivery point is required to be decided; and

     * (b) the relative costs to the carrier and the interception agency of any particular point that is chosen as that delivery point; and

     * (c) the reasonable needs of the interception agency; and

     * (d) the reasonable commercial requirements of the carrier; and

     * (e) the location of any delivery points already existing in relation to that interception agency or other interception agencies.

    * (7) It is not a requirement that a place where an interception takes place is the place nominated as the location of a delivery point if, in accordance with the criteria set out in subsection (6), another more suitable location exists.

    * Changing delivery points

    * (8) If:

     * (a) the location of a delivery point has been determined by the ACMA in respect of a particular kind of telecommunications service and of an interception agency; and

     * (b) as a result of a material change in the circumstances of the carrier concerned, the location of that point becomes unsuitable;

    * the carrier: 

     * (c) may nominate another place as the location of that delivery point in respect of that kind of telecommunications service and of that interception agency; and

     * (d) must inform the Communications Access Coordinator of the place so nominated.

        * Note: The nominated location becomes a delivery point: see the definition of **_delivery point _**in subsection 5(1).

    * (9) If:

     * (a) the location of a delivery point has been determined by the ACMA in respect of a particular kind of telecommunications service and of an interception agency; and

     * (b) as a result of a material change in the circumstances of the interception agency, the location of that point becomes unsuitable; and

     * (c) the interception agency, either directly or through the Communications Access Coordinator, requests the carrier to nominate another place as the location of that delivery point;

    * the carrier must: 

     * (d) nominate another place as the location of that delivery point in respect of that kind of telecommunications service and of that interception agency; and

     * (e) inform the Communications Access Coordinator of the place nominated.

        * Note: The nominated location becomes a delivery point: see the definition of **_delivery point _**in subsection 5(1).

    * (10) Subsections (2) to (7) apply in relation to a nomination under subsection (8) or (9) as if it were a nomination under subsection (1).

     * (a) this Act; or

     * (b) section 313 of the _Telecommunications Act 1997_.

    * (2) The terms and conditions on which a carrier is to provide a delivery capability must be consistent with the following principles:

     * (a) the principle that the most cost effective means of ensuring the development, installation and maintenance of that capability is employed;

     * (a) must cooperate in full with the person or body carrying out the audit; and
