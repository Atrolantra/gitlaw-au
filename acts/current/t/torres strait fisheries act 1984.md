     * 2.	The persons or vessels licensed by one Party which have been authorised, or are to be authorised, under the provisions of paragraph 1 of this Article to fish in waters under the jurisdiction of the other Party shall comply with the relevant fisheries laws and regulations of the other Party except that they shall be exempt from licensing fees, levies and other charges imposed by the other Party in respect of such fishing activities.

     * 3.	Each Party shall make it an offence under its fisheries laws or regulations for a person to use a vessel of its nationality to fish in Protected Zone commercial fisheries for species of fisheries resources in areas over which the other Party has jurisdiction in respect of those species--

   * (a) without being duly licensed or authorised by that other Party; or 

   * (b) in the case of a licensed or authorised vessel, in breach of the fisheries laws or regulations of the other Party applying within those areas.

In accordance with the provisions of this Article, and in other appropriate cases as may be agreed between the Parties, corrective action in respect of offences or suspected offences against the fisheries laws or regulations of the Parties shall be taken by the authorities of the Party whose nationality is borne by the vessel or person concerned (called in this Article "the first Party") and not by the Party in whose area of jurisdiction the offence or suspected offence occurs (called in this Article "the second Party"). 

     * 7.	The Parties acknowledge that the principle stated in paragraph 6 of this Article should not be applied so as to frustrate the enforcement of fisheries laws or regulations or to enable offenders against those laws or regulations to go unpunished. 

     * 8.	Where, in the case of a suspected offence alleged to have been committed in or in the vicinity of the Protected Zone, it appears that the offence was, or might reasonably be considered to have been, committed in the course of traditional fishing, corrective action or other measures shall be taken by the authorities of the first Party and not by the authorities of the second Party and, if being detained by the authorities of the second Party, the alleged offenders and their vessel shall be either released or handed over to the authorities of the first Party, in accordance with arrangements that will avoid undue expense or inconvenience to the authorities of the second Party. 

     * 9.	Where paragraph 8 of this Article applies, the authorities of the second Party may require assurance in a particular case that corrective action or other measures will be taken by the authorities of the first Party that will adequately ensure that the activity complained of will not be repeated. 

     * 10.	Where the provisions of paragraph 8 of this Article do not apply, and the person or vessel alleged to have been involved or used in the commission of a suspected offence in the Protected Zone is licensed to fish in the Protected Zone by the authorities of the first Party, corrective action shall be taken by the authorities of the first Party and not by the authorities of the second Party and, if being detained by the authorities of the second Party, the alleged offenders and their vessel shall be either released or handed over to the authorities of the first Party, in accordance with arrangements that will avoid undue expense or inconvenience to the authorities of the second Party, and the provisions of paragraph3 and 14 of this article shall apply. 

     * 11.	The provisions of paragraph 10 of this Article shall also apply in respect of a suspected offence by a person or vessel of the first Party in an area of jurisdiction of the second Party outside the Protected Zone where--

   * (a) that person or vessel was authorised by the authorities of the second Party to fish in the area where the suspected offence was committed under the arrangements referred to in paragraph 1 of Article 22 of this Treaty; and 

   * (b) the suspected offence was committed in relation to the fishery the subject of that authorisation and did not involve the taking of other species or potential injury to another fishery. 

     * 12.	Persons or vessels of the first Party detained by the authorities of the Second Party in the circumstances described in paragraphs 8 and 10 of this Article may be detained for as long as necessary to enable those authorities to conduct an expeditious investigation into the offence and to obtain evidence. Thereafter, they shall not be detained other than for the purpose of the handing over of the persons or vessels in accordance with the provisions of those paragraphs unless they are lawfully detained on some other ground. 

     * 13.	If an alleged offender referred to in paragraph 10 of this Article is, in respect of conduct in waters under the jurisdiction of the second party--

   * (a) convicted of an offence against the fisheries laws or regulations of the first Party; or 

   * (b) found by the authorities of the first Party, on the basis of sufficient available evidence, to have contravened or failed to comply with a condition of his licence or authorisation or that of his vessel; 

     * the authorities of the first Party shall, where appropriate and having regard to paragraph 7 of this Article, cancel or suspend the licence or authorisation of the person or his vessel so far as it relates to the Protected Zone commercial fisheries. 

     * 14.	Where a person or vessel involved or used in the commission of the alleged offence referred to in paragraph 10 of this Article is also currently licensed or authorised to fish in the area of the Protected Zone by the second Party, the authorities of the second Party may, after receiving a report and representations, if any, from the authorities of the first Party, cancel or suspend that licence or authorisation in accordance with its laws for such period as is warranted by the circumstances of the case. 

     * 15.	Each Party shall provide the other Party with any evidence obtained during investigations carried out in accordance with this Article into a suspected offence involving a person or vessel of the other Party. Each Party shall take appropriate measures to facilitate the admission of such evidence in proceedings taken in respect of the suspected offence. 

     * 16.	In this Article references to persons and vessels of, or of the nationality of, a Party include references to persons or vessels licensed by that Party under subparagraph 1 (b) of Article 26 of this Treaty, and the crews of vessels so licensed, except where such persons or vessels have a prior current licence from the other Party under that subparagraph.

## Schedule 2--Provisions relating to detention of suspected illegal foreign fishers

   * Note: See section 54A.

### Part 1--Preliminary

#### Division 1--Objects of this Schedule

##### 1   objects of this Schedule

     * (1) This Schedule has 3 main objects.

     * (2) The first main object is to provide for the detention (**_fisheries detention_**) in  or a Territory of persons who:

       * (a) are reasonably suspected by an officer of having committed an offence involving the use of a foreign boat or a  boat; and

       * (b) are not Australian citizens or Australian residents;

     * for a limited period for the purposes of determining whether to charge them with the offence.

     * (3) The second main object is to provide for persons in fisheries detention to be searched, screened, given access to facilities for obtaining legal advice, and identified.

     * (4) The third main object is to facilitate the transition of persons from fisheries detention to immigration detention under the _Migration Act 1958_:

       * (a) by providing for the things mentioned in subclause (3) to be done in a way corresponding to the way that Act provides for those things to be done to persons in immigration detention; and

       * (b) by authorising the disclosure of personal information about individuals who are or have been in fisheries detention to persons, agencies and organisations responsible for holding the individuals in immigration detention, for the purpose of the immigration detention and welfare of the individuals.

          * Note: The enforcement visa of a person who is neither an Australian citizen nor an Australian resident ceases to have effect under the _Migration Act 1958_ when the person ceases to be in fisheries detention, so that Act requires the person to be taken into immigration detention.

#### Division 2--Definitions

##### 2  Definitions

     * (1) The Minister may, by instrument, appoint one or more persons (except persons who are officers) to be detention officers.

          * Note: Officers have the same powers as detention officers, as well as other powers, so there is no reason for officers to be appointed as detention officers.

     * (2) An instrument appointing persons to be detention officers:

       * (a) may identify the persons by reference to a class; and

       * (b) may provide for persons to be appointed when they become members of the class at or after a time specified in the instrument.

          * Note: Subsection 42(6AA) makes similar provision for officers and their assistants.

     * The instrument has effect according to its terms, despite subclause (1).

     * (4) An instrument under subclause (3) may specify one or more persons by reference to their being members of a specified class at or after a time specified in the instrument.

     * (5) An instrument made under subclause (3) is not a legislative instrument.

### Part 2--Detaining suspected illegal foreign fishers

#### Division 1--Initial detention by an officer

##### 8  Power to detain

     * (1) An officer may detain a person in Australia or a Territory for the purposes of investigating and determining, during the period of detention, whether or not the person committed an offence against section 45, 46A, 46B, 46C, 46D, 48, 49, 49A, 51 or 51A or an offence against section 6 of the _Crimes Act 1914_ relating to such an offence, if the officer has reasonable grounds to believe that the person:

       * (b) has been presented, while detained by that officer, to a detention officer for detention by a detention officer.

     * (2) However, the detention officer may not detain the person if the detention officer has reasonable grounds to believe that the person has ceased to be in detention since the last time the person was detained by an officer under Division 1.

#### Division 5--End of detention

##### 13  End of detention

     * Detainee who was on a foreign boat

     * (1) A detainee who was detained under subclause 8(1) because the officer mentioned in that subclause had reasonable grounds to believe that the detainee was on a foreign boat must be released from detention:

       * (a) as soon as an officer or detention officer knows or reasonably believes that the detainee is an Australian citizen or an Australian resident; or

       * (b) at the time the detainee is brought before a magistrate following a decision to charge the detainee with an offence referred to in subclause 8(1); or

       * (c) at the time a decision is made not to charge the detainee with an offence referred to in that subclause; or

       * (d) at the end of 168 hours after the detention began;

     * whichever occurs first.

     * Detainee who was on a  boat

     * (2) A detainee who was detained under subclause 8(1) because the officer mentioned in that subclause had reasonable grounds to believe that the detainee was on a  boat must be released from detention:

       * (a) as soon as an officer or detention officer knows or reasonably believes that the detainee is an Australian citizen or an Australian resident; or

       * (b) as soon as an officer believes that the detainee did not commit an offence described in that subclause; or

       * (c) as soon as an officer finishes investigating whether the detainee committed an offence described in that subclause; or

       * (d) at the end of 72 hours after the detention began;

     * whichever occurs first.

     * Papua New Guineans on foreign boats

     * (3) Subclause (1) ceases to apply to a detainee, and subclause (2) applies instead to the detainee (as if the officer mentioned in subclause 8(1) had reasonable grounds to believe that the detainee had been on a  boat), if an officer or detention officer knows or reasonably believes that the detainee is:

       * (a) a citizen of ; or

       * (b) a person who is usually resident in  and whose continued presence there is not subject to a limitation as to time imposed by law.

          * Note: The fact that subclause (2) applies as if the officer mentioned in subclause 8(1) had reasonable grounds to believe that the detainee had been on a  boat does not affect whether the detainee was using a foreign boat in an offence against section 45, 46A, 46B, 46C, 46D or 48.

     * (4) To avoid doubt, subclause (3) does not affect the validity of the detention of a detainee before the first time (the **_recognition time_**) an officer or detention officer knew or reasonably believed that the detainee was:

       * (a) a citizen of ; or

       * (b) a person who is usually resident in  and whose continued presence there is not subject to a limitation as to time imposed by law.

     * This has effect even if the recognition time is more than 72 hours after the detention began.

          * Note: If the recognition time was more than 72 hours after the detention began, the effect of subclause (3) applying subclause (2) is to require the release of the detainee at the recognition time. However, subclause (3) does not affect the validity of detention in the period starting 72 hours after the detention began and ending at the recognition time.

#### Division 6--Offence of escaping from detention

       * (a) it is decided that the thing is not to be used in evidence;

       * (b) the period of 60 days after the authorised officer takes possession of the thing ends.

     * (5) However, the authorised officer does not have to take those steps if:

       * (a) in a paragraph (4)(b) case:

        * (i) proceedings in respect of which the thing might provide evidence have been instituted before the end of the 60 day period and have not been completed (including an appeal to a court in relation to those proceedings); or

        * (ii) the authorised officer may retain the thing because of an order under clause 21; or

       * (b) in any case--the authorised officer is otherwise authorised (by a law, or an order of a court or a tribunal, of the Commonwealth or a State or Territory) to retain, destroy or dispose of the thing.

          * Note: This clause corresponds closely to section 252C of the _Migration Act 1958_.

     * (3) Before making the application, the authorised officer must:

       * (a) take reasonable steps to discover which persons' interests would be affected by the retention of the thing; and

       * (b) if it is practicable to do so, notify each person who the authorised officer believes to be such a person of the proposed application.

          * Note: This clause corresponds closely to section 252D of the _Migration Act 1958_.

     * (4) A notice under paragraph (3)(b) is not a legislative instrument.

##### 21  Magistrate may order that thing be retained

     * (1) The magistrate may order that the authorised officer who made an application under clause 20 may retain the thing if the magistrate is satisfied that it is necessary for the authorised officer to do so:

       * (a) for the purposes of an investigation as to whether an offence has been committed; or

       * (b) to enable evidence of an offence to be secured for the purposes of a prosecution.

     * (2) The order must specify the period for which the authorised officer may retain the thing.

     * (3) A power conferred on a magistrate by this clause is conferred on the magistrate in a personal capacity and not as a court or a member of a court.

     * (4) The magistrate need not accept the power conferred.

     * (5) A magistrate exercising a power under this clause has the same protection and immunity as if he or she were exercising that power as, or as a member of, the court of which the magistrate is a member.
