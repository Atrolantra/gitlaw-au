##### 16  Automatic transitional TEQSA registration while TEQSA considers pending application for re-registration

   * (1) If the application mentioned in paragraph 14(a) was for re-registration, the provider is taken to be a registered higher education provider for the purposes of the TEQSA Act.

   * Note: This automatic registration means, for example, that the provider must comply with conditions imposed from time to time on the registration (see section 24 of that Act).

   * (2) The provider's registration is for the period:

      * (a) starting at the transition time; and

      * (b) ending when TEQSA notifies the provider, under section 22 of the TEQSA Act, of TEQSA's decision to grant or reject the application.

      * (a) the provider category in which the provider is registered;

      * (b) whether the provider may self-accredit one or more courses of study.

   * (4) Paragraph (2)(b) has effect subject to Division 1 of Part 7 (about cancelling registration and other administrative sanctions).

   * Note: The provider cannot apply under the TEQSA Act to have this transitional registration renewed.

      * (a) starting at the transition time; and

      * (b) ending at the later of:

        * (i) the time the course of study would cease to be accredited under the relevant State or Territory law (ignoring the enactment of the TEQSA Act); and

      * that would (ignoring the enactment of the TEQSA Act) result in the suspension of the State accreditation being lifted; and

      * (c) within 60 days after the transition time, the provider notifies TEQSA, in the approved form, of the State review decision.

   * Note: TEQSA may impose conditions on the automatic TEQSA accreditation in return for lifting the suspension (see section 53 of the TEQSA Act).

   * (4) If under subitem (1) TEQSA decides not to lift the suspension:
