    * (2) However, the document must be served in New Zealand in the same way that the document is required or permitted, under the procedural rules of the Australian court or tribunal, to be served in the place of issue.

        * Note: For service of the initiating document in New Zealand under this Part, it is not necessary for the Australian court or tribunal:

         * (a) to give leave for the service; or

         * (b) to be satisfied that there is a connection between the proceeding and Australia.

##### 10  Effect of service under section 9

    * Service of an initiating document in New Zealand under section 9: 

     * (a) has the same effect; and

     * (b) gives rise to the same proceeding;

    * as if the initiating document had been served in the place of issue.

        * Note: For initiating documents issued by an Australian court, the defendant may apply to the Australian court to stay the proceeding on the grounds that a New Zealand court is the more appropriate court: see Part 3. In some cases, the defendant and the defendant's lawyer may appear remotely in that stay proceeding without the court's leave: see subsection 18(4).

##### 11  Information that must be given to the defendant

    * (1) An initiating document served under section 9 must contain or be accompanied by information for the defendant that is prescribed by the regulations.

     * (b) the consequences of the document being served on the defendant in New Zealand under section 9.

##### 12  Consequences of not giving the information to the defendant

    * (1) Failure to comply with section 11 does not invalidate:

     * (a) the proceeding; or

     * (b) any step taken in relation to the proceeding.

    * (2) However, the issuing Australian court or tribunal may, on application by the defendant under subsection (3), make an order in the terms it considers appropriate setting aside:

     * (a) the proceeding; or

     * (b) any step taken in relation to the proceeding.

    * (3) The defendant's application can only be made:

     * (a) within a reasonable time; and

     * (b) before the defendant has commenced taking any step in the proceeding;

    * after the defendant becomes aware of the failure.

##### 13  When the defendant must file an appearance

    * Period within which defendant must file appearance

    * (1) A defendant who is served with an initiating document in New Zealand under section 9 and who wishes to file an appearance in the issuing Australian court or tribunal must do so within:

      * (i) 30 working days of the issuing Australian court or tribunal after the day on which the initiating document was served on the defendant;

      * (ii) the period within which the procedural rules of the issuing Australian court or tribunal would have required or permitted the defendant to file an appearance if the initiating document had been served in the place of issue; or

     * (b) if, before or after the end of the default period, the plaintiff or defendant applies to the issuing Australian court or tribunal for a shorter or longer period--any shorter or longer period the court or tribunal considers appropriate.

    * Meaning of **appearance**

     * (c) either:

      * (i) complies with any requirements which the document must comply with under the procedural rules of the issuing Australian court or tribunal; or

      * (ii) the issuing Australian court or tribunal determines to be acceptable despite any noncompliance with such requirements.

##### 14  Defendant's address for service

    * The defendant's address for service for the proceeding is:

     * (a) the address that is stated in the defendant's appearance; or

     * (b) if, on application by the defendant, the court or tribunal directs that another address in Australia or New Zealand is to be the defendant's address for service for the proceeding--that other address.

##### 15  Security for costs

    * (1) An issuing Australian court or tribunal may, on application by a defendant that was served, or purportedly served, under section 9, order that:

### Part 3--Australian courts declining jurisdiction on the grounds that a New Zealand court is a more appropriate forum

#### Division 1--Introduction

##### 16  Guide to this Part

    * This Part is about when an Australian court may stay a proceeding on the grounds that a New Zealand court is the more appropriate court to determine the matters in issue.

    * The Australian court may only stay the proceeding if the defendant applies for the proceeding to be stayed. The defendant must make the application within 30 working days after being served with the initiating document for the proceeding, or such shorter or longer period that the court considers appropriate.

    * The Australian court may only stay the proceeding if it is satisfied that a New Zealand court has jurisdiction to determine the matters in issue and that it is the more appropriate court to determine those matters. In determining whether the New Zealand court is the more appropriate court, the Australian court must take certain matters into account. They are set out in section 19.

    * However, if the parties have made an exclusive choice of court agreement that designates either an Australian court or a New Zealand court as the court to determine the matters in issue, the Australian court's order as to whether or not to stay the proceeding must be consistent with that agreement (see section 20).

     * (b) the defendant;

     * (c) any other person who is required or permitted, by the regulations or the Australian court's procedural rules, to be served with the defendant's application.

    * (3) The request must be made within:

     * (a) 10 working days of the Australian court after the day the defendant made the application; or

    * (4) The defendant and the defendant's lawyer may appear remotely in a hearing in the Australian court about the application for an order to stay the proceeding if:

     * (a) the defendant was served, or purportedly served, with the initiating document for the proceeding in New Zealand under section 9; and

     * (c) a remote appearance medium is, or can reasonably be made, available.

    * This subsection applies despite Subdivisions A and B of Part 6, but is subject to the rest of Part 6.

     * (b) the places of residence of the witnesses likely to be called in the proceeding;

     * (c) the place where the subject matter of the proceeding is situated;

     * (a) it is null and void under New Zealand law (including the rules of private international law); or

     * (b) a party to it lacked the capacity to conclude it under Australian law; or

     * (c) giving effect to it would lead to a manifest injustice or would be manifestly contrary to Australian public policy; or

     * (d) for exceptional reasons beyond the control of the parties to it, it cannot reasonably be performed; or

     * (e) the court designated by it as the court to determine the matters in issue between the parties to the proceeding has decided not to determine those matters.

     * (a) a claim is made in a civil proceeding (the **_NZ proceeding_**) in a New Zealand court that is later stayed by an order of the New Zealand court made under the NZ Act on the grounds that an Australian court is the more appropriate court; and

     * (b) the claim is to be made again in a civil proceeding (the **_Australian proceeding_**) in an Australian court after the staying of (and, if applicable, before any deadline stated in the condition of that order staying) the New Zealand proceeding.

### Part 7--Recognition and enforcement in Australia of specified judgments of New Zealand courts and tribunals

#### Division 1--Introduction

##### 64  Guide to this Part

    * This Part is about the enforcement in Australia of specified judgments of New Zealand courts and tribunals.

    * To be enforceable, the judgment has to be registered in an Australian court. To be registered, the judgment must be a registrable NZ judgment (which is defined in section 66) and an application for its registration must be made.

    * Once registered in an Australian court, the judgment has the same force, and may be enforced in the Australian court, as if the judgment had been given by the Australian court. There are some exceptions to this--see, for example:

     * (a) subsection 74(2) (which provides that the judgment cannot be enforced during a particular period if notice of the registration has not been given to each liable person); and

     * (b) section 75 (which provides that the judgment cannot be enforced if the judgment could not be enforced in New Zealand); and

     * (c) section 76 (which provides grounds for when the Australian court may stay a proceeding to enforce the judgment).

#### Division 2--Recognition and enforcement in Australia of specified judgments of New Zealand courts and tribunals

##### 65  When registrable NZ judgments are enforceable in Australia

    * (1) A registrable NZ judgment cannot be enforced in Australia if it is not registered in an Australian court under section 68.

        * Note: A registrable NZ judgment cannot be enforced in Australia otherwise than in accordance with this Part.

    * (2) Provisions of an NZ judgment that, because of section 71, could be registered in an Australian court under section 68 cannot be enforced in Australia if they are not so registered.

##### 66  Meaning of registrable NZ judgment

    * (1) A judgment is a **_registrable NZ judgment _**if:

     * (a) the judgment is a final and conclusive judgment that is given in a civil proceeding by a New Zealand court; or

     * (b) the judgment is a final and conclusive judgment that:

      * (i) is given in a civil proceeding by a New Zealand tribunal that is prescribed by the regulations; and

      * (ii) is of a kind prescribed by the regulations; or

     * (c) the judgment is a final and conclusive judgment that:

      * (i) is given in a criminal proceeding by a New Zealand court; and

      * (ii) consists wholly of a requirement to pay an injured party a sum of money by way of compensation, damages or reparation; or

     * (d) the judgment is a final and conclusive judgment that:

      * (i) is given in a criminal proceeding by a New Zealand court; and

      * (ii) consists wholly of an imposition of a regulatory regime criminal fine; and

      * (iii) meets the conditions (if any) of a kind prescribed by the regulations; or

     * (e) the judgment is a final and conclusive order made under the NZ Act or the NZ Evidence Act by a New Zealand court or tribunal, being an order for the payment of expenses incurred:

      * (i) by a witness in complying with a subpoena served on the witness in Australia under Division 3 of Part 5 of this Act; or

      * (ii) in connection with appearing remotely from Australia in a New Zealand proceeding under Division 3 of Part 6 of this Act; or

     * (f) the judgment is an NZ market proceeding judgment; or

     * (g) the judgment is registered in a New Zealand court under the _Reciprocal Enforcement of Judgments Act 1934 _of New Zealand.

    * (2) However, a judgment is not a **_registrable NZ judgment _**if it wholly or partly:

     * (a) relates to an excluded matter; or

     * (b) is a nonmoney judgment of a kind prescribed by the regulations; or

     * (c) is an order under proceeds of crime legislation; or

     * (d) is an order relating to the granting of probate or letters of administration or the administration of the estate of a deceased person; or

     * (e) is an order relating to the guardianship or care of a person who is incapable of managing his or her personal affairs; or

     * (f) is an order relating to the management of the property of a person who is incapable of managing that property; or

     * (g) is an order relating to the care, control, or welfare of a child; or

     * (h) imposes a civil pecuniary penalty of a kind prescribed by the regulations; or

     * (i) is an order that, if contravened by a person to whom it is directed, will make the person liable to conviction for an offence in the place where it was made; or

     * (j) relates to a matter of a kind prescribed by the regulations.

    * (3) For the purposes of subsection (1), a judgment is to be treated as final and conclusive even if:

     * (a) a person may appeal against it in a New Zealand court or tribunal; or

     * (b) an appeal against it in a New Zealand court or tribunal has not been finally determined.

    * (4) For the purposes of subparagraph (1)(b)(ii) if the judgment:

     * (a) is not made in connection with the performance of an adjudicative function; or

     * (b) is not enforceable without an order of a court; or

     * (c) imposes a civil pecuniary penalty.

    * (1) If a sum of money payable under an NZ judgment is expressed in a currency other than Australian currency, the judgment must be registered in the Australian court under section 68:

     * (a) if an entitled person has requested in the application for registration that the judgment be registered in a particular currency--in that currency; and

     * (b) otherwise--as if it were for an equivalent amount in Australian currency, calculated in accordance with the rate of exchange on the working day (the **_conversion day_**) of the Australian court before the working day of that court on which the entitled person made the application for registration.

    * (2) The rate of exchange on the conversion day is that determined in the manner prescribed by the regulations.

    * (3) This section is subject to section 70 (which deals with money judgments that are partly satisfied).

##### 70  Money judgments partly satisfied when entitled person applies for registration

    * If: 

     * (a) an entitled person applies for registration of a money judgment; and

     * (b) at the time of application, the judgment has been partly satisfied;

    * then the Australian court may only register the balance remaining payable under that judgment at that time under section 68.

##### 71  Judgments only some provisions of which are registrable

    * (1) This section applies to an NZ judgment if an Australian court to which an application for registration of the judgment is made considers that:

     * (a) the judgment is one in relation to different matters (for example, because it is a judgment in relation to different subject matters, or granting different kinds of relief); and

     * (b) some of the provisions of the judgment (the **_registrable provisions_**) would, if contained in a separate judgment, make that separate judgment a registrable NZ judgment.

    * (2) The judgment may be registered in the Australian court under section 68 in relation to the registrable provisions, but no other provisions, as if the registrable provisions were a separate registrable NZ judgment.

##### 72  Setting aside registration

    * (1) An Australian court in which an NZ judgment is registered must, on application by a liable person under subsection (2), set aside the registration of the judgment if:

     * (c) both of the following subparagraphs apply:

      * (i) the judgment was given in a proceeding the subject matter of which was immovable property, or was given in a proceeding _in rem_ the subject matter of which was movable property;

      * (ii) that property was, at the time of the proceeding in the original court or tribunal, not situated in New Zealand.

    * (2) The liable person's application must be made within:

     * (a) 30 working days of the Australian court after the day the liable person was given notice of registration under section 73; or

     * (b) if, before or after that period, the liable person applies to the Australian court for a longer period--any longer period the Australian court considers appropriate.

    * (3) The Australian court must not set aside the registration otherwise than in accordance with this section.

##### 73  Notice of registration

    * (1) If an Australian court registers an NZ judgment, the entitled person must give a notice of the registration to every liable person.

        * Note: If the notice is not given, the entitled person will not be able to enforce the NZ judgment for 45 working days of the Australian court after the registration day: see section 74.

     * (b) be given in the manner prescribed by the regulations.

    * (3) The notice must be given within:

     * (a) 15 working days of the Australian court after the day of registration; or

     * (b) if, before or after that period, the entitled person applies to the Australian court for a longer period--any longer period the Australian court considers appropriate.

##### 74  Effect of registration and notice of registration

    * (1) A registered NZ judgment:

     * (a) has the same force and effect; and

     * (b) may give rise to the same proceedings for enforcement;

    * as if the judgment had been given by the Australian court in which it is registered.

        * Note: An NZ judgment can be enforced in Australia as soon as it is registered and notification of it is given. The entitled person does not need to wait until the expiry of the period in which the liable person could make an application to set aside the registration or to stay enforcement of the judgment under section 72 or 76. Nor does the entitled person need to wait until such an application is finally determined.

    * (2) However, if notice of the registration of the judgment has not been given to every liable person under section 73, then subsection (1) does not apply during the period that is 45 working days of the Australian court after the day of registration.

    * (3) Subsection (1) is subject to:

     * (a) section 75 (which deals with restrictions on the enforceability of registered NZ judgments); and

     * (b) an order of the Australian court staying the enforcement of the judgment (whether the order is made under section 76 or otherwise); and

     * (c) section 78 (which deals with interest on registered NZ judgments).

##### 75  Restriction on enforcing registered NZ judgments

    * A registered NZ judgment is capable of being enforced in Australia only if, and to the extent that, at the time it is being or is to be enforced, the judgment is capable of being enforced in the original court or tribunal or in another New Zealand court or tribunal.

##### 76  Stay of enforcement of registered NZ judgment so that the liable person can appeal it

    * (1) An Australian court in which an NZ judgment has been registered may, on an application by a liable person under subsection (3), order that a proceeding in that court for enforcement of the judgment:

     * (a) not be commenced until a specified time or event; or

     * (b) be stayed for a specified period.

    * (2) The order:

     * (a) must be made subject to the following conditions:

      * (i) that the liable person make an application to set aside, vary or appeal against the judgment to a New Zealand court or tribunal that has power to grant the application by the end of a period specified in the order;

      * (ii) that the liable person prosecute that application expeditiously; and

     * (b) may be made subject to any other conditions that the Australian court considers appropriate (including conditions as to the giving of security).

    * (3) The liable person's application must be made within:

     * (a) 30 working days of the Australian court after the day the liable person was given notice of the registration under section 73; or

     * (b) if, before or after that period, the liable person applies to the Australian court for a longer period--any longer period the Australian court considers appropriate.

    * (4) This section does not affect any other powers of the Australian court to stay the enforcement of the registered NZ judgment on any grounds on which the court could stay the enforcement of a judgment of an Australian court or tribunal.

##### 77  Costs and expenses of enforcement of registered NZ judgments

    * (1) If a proceeding for enforcement of a registered NZ judgment is commenced in an Australian court, the following are recoverable in that proceeding:

     * (a) costs and expenses reasonably incurred by, or on behalf of, the entitled person in, or incidental to, registration of the judgment;

     * (b) costs and expenses reasonably incurred by, or on behalf of, the entitled person in attempting to enforce the judgment in the original court or tribunal.

    * (2) However, an entitled person's entitlement to recover, and a liable person's liability to pay, the costs and expenses specified in paragraph (1)(b) are the same as they would be in a proceeding in that Australian court for enforcement of:

     * (a) a judgment given by the Australian court that is similar to the registered NZ judgment; or

     * (b) if there is no such similar judgment, a judgment given by the Australian court that is most analogous to the registered NZ judgment.

##### 78  Interest on registered NZ judgments

    * Interest on a sum of money payable under a registered NZ judgment: 

     * (a) is payable at the same rate or rates and in respect of the same period or periods as would be applicable in the original court or tribunal; and
