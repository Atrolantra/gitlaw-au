### Part 41--Introduction

#### Division 1--Overview of this Chapter

##### 41B  General

    * The purpose of this Chapter is to ensure the safety and satisfactory performance of medical devices. It does this by:

     * (a) setting out particular requirements for medical devices; and

     * (b) establishing administrative processes principally aimed at ensuring those requirements are met; and

     * (c) providing for enforcement through a series of offences and civil penalty provisions.

##### 41BA  Requirements for medical devices (Parts 42 and 43)

    * The requirements for medical devices are: 

     * (a) essential principles (that are about the safety and performance characteristics of medical devices); and

     * (b) conformity assessment procedures (that are mainly about the application of quality management systems).

        * Note: Medical device standards may be made under Division 2 of Part 42, and conformity assessment standards may be made under Division 2 of Part 43, but they are not requirements.

##### 41BB  Administrative processes (Parts 44 to 410)

    * The administrative processes under this Chapter are: 

     * (a) issuing conformity assessment certificates for some manufacturers of medical devices; and

     * (b) including medical devices in the Register; and

     * (c) suspending or cancelling entries of medical devices from the Register; and

     * (ca) exempting medical devices from various provisions of this Chapter to deal with emergency situations; and

     * (d) exempting medical devices from the requirement to be included in the Register; and

     * (e) obtaining information about medical devices; and

     * (f) requiring public notification of problems with medical devices, and recovery of such devices.

        * Note: Part 410 provides for assessment fees to be payable in some circumstances.

##### 41BC  Enforcement (Part 411)

    * Part 411 contains offences and civil penalty provisions that are aimed at ensuring that: 

     * (a) the requirements for medical devices are complied with; and

     * (b) the administrative processes under this Chapter (particularly the inclusion of medical devices in the Register) are followed.

        * Note: There are some offences and civil penalty provisions in Parts 44 to 49. They generally relate to matters ancillary to administrative processes in those Parts (e.g. false or misleading statements in applications).

#### Division 2--Interpretation

##### 41BD  What is a medical device

    * (1) A **_medical device_** is:

     * (a) any instrument, apparatus, appliance, material or other article (whether used alone or in combination, and including the software necessary for its proper application) intended, by the person under whose name it is or is to be supplied, to be used for human beings for the purpose of one or more of the following:

      * (i) diagnosis, prevention, monitoring, treatment or alleviation of disease;

      * (ii) diagnosis, monitoring, treatment, alleviation of or compensation for an injury or disability;

      * (iii) investigation, replacement or modification of the anatomy or of a physiological process;

      * (iv) control of conception;

     * and that does not achieve its principal intended action in or on the human body by pharmacological, immunological or metabolic means, but that may be assisted in its function by such means; or

     * (aa) any instrument, apparatus, appliance, material or other article specified under subsection (2A); or

     * (ab) any instrument, apparatus, appliance, material or other article that is included in a class of instruments, apparatus, appliances, materials or other articles specified under subsection (2B); or

    * (2) For the purposes of paragraph (1)(a), the purpose for which an instrument, apparatus, appliance, material or other article (the **_main equipment_**) is to be used is to be ascertained from the information supplied, by the person under whose name the main equipment is or is to be supplied, on or in any one or more of the following:

     * (a) the labelling on the main equipment;

     * (b) the instructions for using the main equipment;

     * (c) any advertising material relating to the main equipment;

     * (d) technical documentation describing the mechanism of action of the main equipment.

    * (2A) The Secretary may, by notice published in the _Gazette _or on the Department's website, specify a particular instrument, apparatus, appliance, material or other article for the purposes of paragraph (1)(aa). The notice is not a legislative instrument.

    * (2B) The Secretary may, by legislative instrument, specify a particular class of instruments, apparatus, appliances, materials or other articles for the purposes of paragraph (1)(ab).

    * (3) The Secretary may, by order published in the _Gazette _or on the Department's website, declare that a particular instrument, apparatus, appliance, material or other article, or that a particular class of instruments, apparatus, appliances, materials or other articles, are not, for the purposes of this Act, medical devices.

        * Note: A declaration under this section does not stop articles from being therapeutic goods.

    * (4) A declaration under this section takes effect on the day on which the declaration is published in the _Gazette _or on the Department's website or on such later day as is specified in the order.

##### 41BE  Kinds of medical devices

    * Unique medical devices

    * (2) If a medical device is not of the same kind as any other medical device:

     * (a) this Chapter applies in relation to the device as if it were a kind of medical device; and

     * (b) references in this Chapter to delivering a reasonable number of samples of the kind of device are taken to be references to delivering the device.

##### 41BH  Meaning of compliance with essential principles

    * (1) A medical device complies, for the purposes of this Chapter (including Part 411), with the essential principles if and only if it does not contravene any of the essential principles.

    * (2) However, a medical device is also taken, for the purposes of this Chapter (other than Part 411), to comply with the essential principles if:

     * (a) the medical device complies with one or more medical device standards that apply to it; and

     * (b) the medical device contravenes the essential principles only in respect of a part or parts of the essential principles to which that medical device standard, or one or more of those medical device standards, relate.

    * (3) For the purposes of this section, a medical device standard relates to a part or parts of the essential principles only if the standard specifies that part or parts.

     * (a) there has been a contravention of the conformity assessment procedures; and

     * (b) the contravention relates, wholly or partly, to that device or its manufacture.

    * (2) However, for the purposes of this Chapter (other than Part 411), subsection (1) does not apply if:

     * (a) the quality management system applied in the manufacture of the medical device complies with one or more conformity assessment standards that apply to it; and

     * (b) the contravention is only in respect of a part or parts of the conformity assessment procedures to which that conformity assessment standard, or one or more of those conformity assessment standards, relate.

    * (3) For the purposes of this section, a conformity assessment standard relates to a part or parts of the conformity assessment procedures only if the standard specifies that part or parts.

#### Division 3--Application provisions

     * (b) a quality management system that complies with the standard is to be treated as having had applied to it those parts of the conformity assessment procedures specified in the standard.

        * Note: Section 12 of the _Legislative Instruments Act 2003_ deals with when a legislative instrument takes effect.

    * (2) A conformity assessment standard may be limited to particular kinds of medical devices.

    * (3) The Minister may, by legislative instrument, vary or revoke an order made under subsection (1).
