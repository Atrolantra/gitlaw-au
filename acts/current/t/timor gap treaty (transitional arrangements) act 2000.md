#### No. 25, 2000

### An Act to amend the Petroleum (Australia-Indonesia Zone of Cooperation) Act 1990 and other legislation consequentially on the United Nations Transitional Administration in East Timor administering East Timor, and for related purposes

[_Assented to 3 April 2000_]

### The Parliament of Australia enacts: 

##### 1  Short title

    * This Act may be cited as the _Timor Gap Treaty (Transitional Arrangements) Act 2000_.

##### 2  Commencement

    * (1) Subject to this section, this Act commences on the day on which it receives the Royal Assent.

    * (2) Sections 3 to 7 and Schedules 1 and 2 (other than items 18 to 25 of Schedule 2) are taken to have commenced at the transition time.

    * (3) Items 18 to 25 of Schedule 2 commence immediately before the commencement of Schedule 1 to the _Crimes at Sea Act 2000_.

##### 3  Schedule(s)

    * Subject to section 2, each Act that is specified in a Schedule to this Act is amended or repealed as set out in the applicable items in the Schedule concerned, and any other item in a Schedule to this Act has effect according to its terms.

##### 4  The transition time

    * In this Act: 

    * **_transition time_** means 1.23 am Australian Central Standard Time on 26 October 1999.

       * Note: This time corresponds to the time in New York when the United Nations Security Council adopted Resolution 1272 (1999), which established UNTAET and gave it responsibility for the administration of East Timor. In 2000 the text of the Resolution was available in the Library of the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade and accessible on the Internet through the Department's or the United Nations' world-wide web site.

##### 5  Validity of things done by the Ministerial Council and the Joint Authority

    * (1) Any thing done by the Ministerial Council or the Joint Authority, during the period commencing on the transition time and ending on 5.55 pm Australian Central Standard Time on 10 February 2000, is not invalid:

      * (a) merely because the Republic of Indonesia ceased to be a party to the Treaty, and UNTAET became a party to the Treaty, at the transition time; or

      * (b) merely because of an invalidity in the membership of the Ministerial Council or the Joint Authority.

    * (2) In this section:

    * **_Joint Authority_** and **_Ministerial Council_** have the meanings given them by subsection 5(1) of the _Petroleum (Timor Gap Zone of Cooperation) Act 1990_.

    * **_Treaty_** has the meaning given by subsection 5(1) of the _Petroleum (Australia-Indonesia Zone of Cooperation) Act 1990_ (as in force immediately before the transition time).

    * **_UNTAET_** means the United Nations Transitional Administration in East Timor.

##### 6  Protection against retrospective criminal liability

    * A person does not commit an offence if the person would not have committed the offence had the amendments made by the items in Schedules 1 and 2 (other than items 18 to 25 of Schedule 2) commenced on the day on which this Act received the Royal Assent (rather than commencing at the transition time).

##### 7  Preservation of immunity from prosecution

    * If a person would have had an immunity from proceedings under subsection 9A(3) of the _Crimes at Sea Act 1979_ but for the amendments made by items 5 and 6 of Schedule 2 commencing retrospectively at the transition time, the person has that immunity by virtue of this section.

      * (a) during the period of the administration of the United Nations Transitional Administration in East Timor (**_UNTAET_**):

       * (ii) the competent authority in relation to the Taxation Code and the territory is the Transitional Administrator of UNTAET, or a person authorised by the Administrator to be such an authority; and

       * (iii) a reference to a resident of a Contracting State is a reference to a resident of the territory, when the case requires; and

      * (b) after the territory ceases to be administered by UNTAET:

       * (i) the body politic of the territory and the competent authority are the body and the authority identifed in the regulations; and

       * (ii) a reference to a resident of a Contracting State is to be interpreted in accordance with the regulations.

       * Note: In 2000 the text of the Resolution was available in the Library of the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade and accessible on the Internet through the Department's or the United Nations' world-wide web site.

  * Note No. 2/2000

  * The Australian Mission in East Timor presents it compliments to the United Nations Transitional Administration in East Timor (UNTAET) and has the honour to refer to UNTAET's Note to the Mission dated 10 February 2000 which reads as follows:

   * "The United Nations Transitional Administration in East Timor (UNTAET) presents its compliments to the Australian Mission in East Timor and has the honour to refer to the fact that, pursuant to United Nations Security Council resolution 1272 (1999) of 25 October 1999, and in accordance with paragraph 35 of the Report of the Secretary-General (S/1999/1024), the United Nations will conclude such international agreements with States and international organisations as may be necessary for the carrying out of the functions of UNTAET in East Timor.

   * An agreement between UNTAET, acting on behalf of East Timor, and Australia, providing practical arrangements for the continuity of the terms of the "Treaty between Australia and the Republic of Indonesia on the Zone of Cooperation in an Area between the Indonesian Province of East Timor and Northern Australia" (the "Timor Gap Treaty") in the transitional period, will benefit the people of East Timor and will assist UNTAET in carrying out its functions entrusted to it under Security Council resolution 1272 (1999). The conclusion of this agreement, however, is without prejudice to the position of the future government of an independent East Timor with regard to the Treaty.

   * UNTAET therefore has the honour to advise the Australian Mission in East Timor that all rights and obligations under the Timor Gap Treaty previously exercised by Indonesia are assumed by UNTAET, acting on behalf of East Timor, until the date of independence of East Timor. UNTAET, acting on behalf of East Timor, and Australia may enter into subsidiary arrangements or agreements relating to the continued operation of the terms of the Treaty. In agreeing to continue the arrangements under the terms of the Treaty, the United Nations does not thereby recognise the validity of the "integration" of East Timor into Indonesia.

   * If the understanding of Australia is in accordance with the foregoing advice, UNTAET has the honour to propose that this Note and Australia's confirmatory Note in reply shall constitute an agreement between UNTAET, acting on behalf of East Timor, and Australia which shall be applied as of 25 October 1999".

  * The Australian Mission has the honour to advise that the foregoing proposal is acceptable to the Government of Australia and to agree that the UNTAET Note and this reply shall constitute an Agreement between the Government of Australia and UNTAET which shall be applied as of 25 October 1999.

  * The Australian Mission in East Timor avails itself of this opportunity to renew to the United Nations Transitional Administration in East Timor the assurances of its highest consideration.
