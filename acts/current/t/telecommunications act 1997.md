    * (1) If the ACMA is satisfied that a body or association represents a particular section of the telecommunications industry, the telemarketing industry or the fax marketing industry, the ACMA may, by written notice given to the body or association, request the body or association to:

     * (a) develop an industry code that applies to participants in that section of the industry and deals with one or more specified matters relating to the telecommunications activities, telemarketing activities or fax marketing activities, as the case may be, of those participants; and

     * (b) give the ACMA a copy of the code within the period specified in the notice. 

        * Note: The ACMA may request the body or association to develop the industry code to replace an earlier industry code that the Information Commissioner (exercising functions under the _Privacy Act 1988_) has advised the ACMA is inconsistent with the Australian Privacy Principles or a relevant registered APP code (as defined in that Act).

    * (2) The period specified in a notice under subsection (1) must run for at least 120 days.

      * (ii) otherwise deal with the performance or conduct of participants in that section of the industry; and

     * (b) in the absence of the request, it is unlikely that an industry code would be developed within a reasonable period.

    * (4) The ACMA must not make a request under subsection (1) in relation to a code if:

     * (a) the code would deal with a matter referred to in paragraph 113(3)(f) (which relates to privacy); and

     * (b) compliance with the code would be likely to have the effect (whether direct or indirect) of requiring customer equipment, customer cabling, a telecommunications network or a facility:

      * (i) to have particular design features; or

      * (ii) to meet particular performance requirements.

    * However, this rule does not apply if the ACMA is satisfied that the benefits to the community from the operation of the code would outweigh the costs of compliance with the code.

    * (4AA) The rule in subsection (4) does not apply to a code to the extent (if any) to which compliance with the code is likely to have the effect (whether direct or indirect) of requiring:

     * (a) optical fibre lines; or

     * (b) facilities used, or for use, in or in connection with optical fibre lines;

    * to: 

     * (c) have particular design features; or

     * (d) meet particular performance requirements.

     * (a) the Australian Privacy Principles; or

     * (b) other provisions of the _Privacy Act 1988_ relating to those principles; or

     * (c) a registered APP code (as defined in that Act) that binds one or more participants in the section of the telecommunications industry, the telemarketing industry or the fax marketing industry to which the request relates; or

     * (d) provisions of that Act that relate to the registered APP code.

    * (5) The ACMA may vary a notice under subsection (1) by extending the period specified in the notice.

    * (6) Subsection (5) does not, by implication, limit the application of subsection 33(3) of the _Acts Interpretation Act 1901_.

    * (7) A notice under subsection (1) may specify indicative targets for achieving progress in the development of the code (for example, a target of 60 days to develop a preliminary draft of the code). 

##### 119  Publication of notice where no body or association represents a section of the telecommunications industry, the telemarketing industry or the fax marketing industry

    * (1) If the ACMA is satisfied that a particular section of the telecommunications industry, the telemarketing industry or the fax marketing industry is not represented by a body or association, the ACMA may publish a notice in the _Gazette_:

    * (3) The numbering plan must specify the numbers that are for use in connection with the supply of carriage services to the public in .

        * Note: **_Specification_** is the "first tier" concept. It operates at the level of a general specification of numbers.

    * (4) Different numbers may be specified for use in connection with the supply of different types of carriage services.

    * (5) The numbering plan may set out rules about:

     * (a) the allocation of numbers to carriage service providers; and

     * (a) in accordance with an allocation system determined under section 463; or

     * (b) otherwise than in accordance with such a system.

    * (3) In exercising the power conferred by subsection (2), the ACCC must ensure that, at all times when the numbering plan is in force, the plan sets out rules about the matter mentioned in paragraph 455(5)(d).

    * (4) The ACMA must exercise its powers under section 455 in a manner consistent with any directions given by the ACCC under subsection (2).

    * (5) In exercising the power conferred by subsection (2), the ACCC must have regard to whether portability of particular allocated numbers is required in order to promote the longterm interests of endusers of carriage services or of services supplied by means of carriage services.
