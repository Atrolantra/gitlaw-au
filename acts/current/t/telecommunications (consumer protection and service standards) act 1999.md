      * (i) the first eligible person has made the request in good faith for the sole purpose of informing itself about the basis on which, or the methods by which, the ACMA made the decision to make the determination concerned; and

    * (2) The penalty rate is 20% per year, or such lower rate as the ACMA determines in writing for the purposes of this subsection.

    * (3) The ACMA may remit the whole or part of a penalty that a person is liable to pay under subsection (2).

    * (4) The penalty for a day is due and payable to the ACMA at the end of that day and may be recovered by the ACMA, on the Commonwealth's behalf, as a debt due to the Commonwealth.

    * (5) Amounts of penalty received are to be paid to the Commonwealth.

    * (6) If the amount of the penalty is not an amount of whole dollars, the penalty is rounded to the nearest dollar (rounding 50 cents upwards).

    * (7) As soon as practicable after a person fails to pay an amount of levy by the time by which it must be paid, the ACMA must, in writing, notify the person that the person is liable to a penalty under this section. However, a failure to do so does not affect the person's liability.

    * (8) A determination made for the purposes of subsection (2) is a legislative instrument.
