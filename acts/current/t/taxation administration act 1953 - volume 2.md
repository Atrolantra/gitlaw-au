    * (2) Under PAYG withholding, amounts are collected in respect of particular kinds of payments or transactions. Usually, someone who makes a payment to you is required to _withhold_ an amount from the payment, and then to pay the amount to the Commissioner.

          * For a list of the payments and other transactions to which
          * PAYG withholding applies, see Division 10


    * PAYG instalments

    * (3) You pay PAYG instalments directly to the Commissioner. These are usually based on your GDPadjusted notional tax or your ordinary income for a past period, but excluding:

      *  	income subject to PAYG withholding (with certain exceptions)

      *  	exempt income, or income that is otherwise not assessable.

    * An instalment is usually paid after a quarter, but some taxpayers are eligible to pay an annual instalment after the end of the income year.

##### 610  How the amounts collected are dealt with

    * You are entitled to credits for the amounts of your income that are collected under the PAYG system. The credits are applied under Division 3 of Part IIB against your tax debts, and any excess is refunded to you.

#### Part 25--Pay as you go (PAYG) withholding

##### Division 10--Guide to Part 25

##### 101  What this Part is about

    * Under PAYG withholding, amounts are collected in respect of particular kinds of payments or transactions. Usually, someone who makes a payment to you is required to _withhold_ an amount from the payment, and then to pay the amount to the Commissioner. If the payment is personal services income that is included in the assessable income of someone else under Division 86 of the _Income Tax Assessment Act 1997_, the payer must pay such an amount to the Commissioner at a later date.

    * If a noncash benefit is provided instead of a payment, the provider must first pay to the Commissioner the amount that would have been withheld from the payment.

    * This Part also contains provisions about the obligations and rights of payers and recipients.

##### 105  Summary of withholding payments

    * (1) The payments and other transactions covered by PAYG withholding are called withholding payments. They are summarised in the table.

          * Note: The obligation to pay an amount to the Commissioner is imposed on the entity making the withholding payment (except for items 17, 19 and 22, and 26 (to the extent that it covers subsection 12390(4))).

    * (2) These can also be treated as withholding payments:

      * (a) alienated personal services payments (see Division 13);

      * (b) noncash benefits (see Division 14).

          * Note: The obligation to pay an amount to the Commissioner is imposed on the entity receiving the alienated personal services payment or providing the noncash benefit.

##### Subdivision 12H--Distributions of managed investment trust income

##### Guide to Subdivision 12H

##### 12375  What this Subdivision is about

    * A managed investment trust may be required to withhold an amount from a payment of its Australian sourced net income (other than dividends, interest and royalties) if the payment is made to an entity whose address, or place for payment, is outside Australia. If the payment is made to another entity, the managed investment trust is required to make information available to the recipient outlining certain details in relation to the payment.

    * If a custodian receives a payment that is covered by that information, it is required to withhold an amount from any related later payment to an entity whose address, or place for payment, is outside . If the later payment is made to another entity, the custodian is required to make information available in relation to that later payment.

    * If an entity that is not a custodian receives a payment that is covered by that information, it is required to withhold an amount from that payment if a foreign resident becomes entitled to that payment. If a resident becomes entitled to the payment, the entity must make information available in relation to that payment.

    * Where there is an obligation to withhold, the applicable withholding rate is determined by the nature of the country or territory in which the recipient's address, place for payment or residency is located and whether the trust is a clean building managed investment trust.

    * A managed investment trust is a clean building managed investment trust if it is a managed investment trust that holds one or more clean buildings and does not derive assessable income from any other taxable Australian property (other than certain assets that are reasonably incidental to a clean building).

    * (1) The object of this section is to ensure that the total of the *fund payments that the trustee of a trust makes in relation to an income year equals, as nearly as practicable, the net income of the trust for the income year, disregarding these amounts (**_excluded amounts_**):

      * (a) a dividend (as defined in Division 11A of Part III of the _Income Tax Assessment Act 1936_) that is subject to, or exempted from, a requirement to withhold under Subdivision 12F;

    * (2) Work out as follows how much of a payment (the **_actual payment_**) made by the trustee of a trust in relation to an income year is a **_fund payment_** in relation to that year:

Method statement

        * Step 1.	Reduce the actual payment by so much of it that is attributable to excluded amounts.

        * Step 2.	Work out what it is reasonable to expect will be the *net income of the trust for the income year:

          * (a) disregarding excluded amounts, expected excluded amounts and deductions relating to those amounts; and

          * (b) on the basis that a *capital gain from *taxable Australian property of the trust that was or would be reduced under step 3 of the method statement in subsection 1025(1) of the _Income Tax Assessment Act 1997_ were double the amount it actually is.

        * Step 3.	The **_fund payment_** is so much of the step 2 amount as is reasonable having regard to:

          * (b) the step 1 amount; and

          * (c) the amounts of any earlier fund payments made by the trustee in relation to the income year; and

          * (d) the expected amounts of any later fund payments the trustee expects to make in relation to the income year.

    * (3) The expected *net income of the trust and the expected amounts of future *fund payments are to be worked out on the basis of the trustee's knowledge when the actual payment is made.

    * (4) However, an amount is not a **_fund payment_** in relation to the income year unless it is paid:

      * (a) during the income year; or

      * (b) within 3 months after the end of the income year; or

      * (c) within a longer period (starting at the end of the period referred to in paragraph (b) and not exceeding 3 months) allowed by the Commissioner.

    * (5) The Commissioner may allow a longer period as mentioned in paragraph (4)(c) only if the Commissioner is of the opinion that the trustee was unable to make the payment during the income year, or within 3 months after the end of the income year, because of circumstances beyond the influence or control of the trustee.

##### Division 13--Alienated personal services payments

##### Table of sections

       * 131	Object of this Division

       * 135	Payment to the Commissioner in respect of alienated personal services payments

       * 1310	Alienated personal services payments

       * 1315	Personal services payment remitters

       * 1320	Time for payments to Commissioner for alienated personal services payments made during 200001

##### 131  Object of this Division

    * The object of this Division is to ensure the efficient collection of income tax (and other liabilities) on any *personal services income included in an individual's assessable income under Division 86 of the _Income Tax Assessment Act 1997_ by:

      * (a) putting *personal services entities receiving *alienated personal services payments in a position similar to their position if amounts were withheld from the payments under Division 12; but

      * (b) doing so in a way that enables them to comply with their obligations without having to withhold amounts separately from each payment.

          * Note: Under Division 86 of the _Income Tax Assessment Act 1997_ (about alienation of personal services income), an individual's personal services income that is gained or produced by another entity is in some cases included in the individual's assessable income. Payments of this income by the entity might not be caught by Division 12.

##### 135  Payment to the Commissioner in respect of alienated personal services payments

    * Obligation to pay amounts

    * (1) A *personal services entity must pay an amount of tax to the Commissioner if:

      * (a) it receives an *alienated personal services payment that relates to an individual's personal services income; and

      * (b) it receives the payment during a *PAYG payment period for which it is a *personal services payment remitter.

    * Working out the amounts

    * (2) Use this method statement to work out the amount:

Method statement

        * Step 1.	Identify the payments that the *personal services entity makes to the individual during the period mentioned in paragraph (1)(b) that are *withholding payments covered by section 1235.

        * Step 2.	Identify the amounts that:

          * (a) are included in the individual's assessable income under section 8615 of the _Income Tax Assessment Act 1997_; and

          * (b) relate to *alienated personal services payments the entity receives during that period.

        * Step 3.	Work out the sum of all the amounts that Division 12 would require the entity to withhold in respect of that period if both of these were taken into account:

          * (a) the payments identified in step 1; and

          * (b) the amounts identified in step 2, as if they were payments of salary covered by section 1235.

        * Step 4.	Work out the sum of all the amounts withheld under section 1235 from the payments identified in step 1.

        * Step 5.	Subtract the sum under step 4 from the sum under step 3.

          * Example: For the PAYG payment period of 1 April 2001 to 30 June 2001, NewIT Pty. Ltd. received amounts totalling $18,000 that were Ron's personal services income. NewIT does not conduct a personal services business.

          * During the period, NewIT paid Ron $3,000 in salary. This is a withholding payment covered by section 1235 (step 1).

          * $15,000 of the amount NewIT received is included in Ron's assessable income under section 8615 of the _Income Tax Assessment Act 1997_ (step 2).

          * If NewIT had paid the $15,000 in salary to Ron within 14 days after the end of the PAYG payment period, the amount that NewIT would have had to withhold under Division 12 on the total amount of $18,000 would have been $4,000 (step 3).

          * NewIT withheld $500 from the salary payment of $3,000, as required by section 1235 (step 4).

          * On the basis of these facts, the amount NewIT must pay to the Commissioner (step 5) is:

    * (3) Subject to subsections (4) and (5), the *personal services entity must pay the amount to the Commissioner by the end of the 21st day after the end of the *PAYG payment period.

          * Note: A different rule applies for alienated personal services payments that large withholders and medium withholders make during the 200001 income year. See section 1320.

    * (4) If:

      * (a) the *personal services entity is a *deferred BAS payer on the 21st day after the end of the *PAYG payment period; and

      * (b) the personal services entity's PAYG payment period is a *quarter;

    * the entity must pay that amount to the Commissioner as shown in the table: 

    * (5) If:

      * (a) the *personal services entity is a *deferred BAS payer on the 21st day after the end of the *PAYG payment period; and

      * (b) the personal services entity's PAYG payment period is a month;

    * the entity must pay that amount to the Commissioner: 

      * (c) by the end of the 28th day of the month following that period unless the PAYG payment period is a December; or

      * (d) by the end of the 28th day of the next February if the PAYG payment period is a December.

##### 1310  Alienated personal services payments

    * An **_alienated personal services payment_** is a payment (including a payment in the form of a *noncash benefit) that a *personal services entity receives and that relates to an amount that:

      * (a) is included in an individual's assessable income under Division 86 of the _Income Tax Assessment Act 1997_; or

      * (b) would be so included but for the fact that the entity received the income in the course of conducting a *personal services business.

          * For valuation of noncash benefits, see sections 21 and 21A of the _Income Tax Assessment Act 1936_.

##### 1315  Personal services payment remitters

    * General

    * (1) A *personal services entity is a **_personal services payment remitter_** for a *PAYG payment period if, in the income year preceding that period:

      * (a) the entity's *ordinary income or *statutory income included a person's *personal services income; and

      * (b) the entity was not conducting a *personal services business.

    * Businesses not previously receiving personal services income

    * (2) A *personal services entity is a **_personal services payment remitter_** for a *PAYG payment period if:

      * (a) the entity's *ordinary income or *statutory income did not include an individual's *personal services income in any income year preceding that period; and

      * (b) it is reasonable to expect that, in the income year during which the period occurs, the entity's income will include a person's *personal services income that the entity will not have received in the course of conducting a *personal services business.

    * (3) It is not reasonable to expect that the *personal services entity will receive a person's *personal services income in the course of conducting a *personal services business if it is reasonable to expect that:

      * (a) the entity will receive at least 80% of that income from the same entity (or one entity and its *associates); and

      * (b) the entity will not meet the results test under section 8718 of the _Income Tax Assessment Act 1997_.

    * Personal services business determinations taking effect

    * (4) However, a *personal services entity is _not_ a **_personal services payment remitter_** for a *PAYG payment period if, during that period or an earlier PAYG payment period in the same income year, a *personal services business determination relating to the entity takes effect.

##### 1320  Time for payments to Commissioner for alienated personal services payments made during 200001

    * (1) Subject to subsection (2), if:

      * (a) a *personal services entity must, under section 135, pay an amount for *alienated personal services payments it received during a particular *PAYG payment period; and

      * (b) the period ends in a *quarter in the *financial year starting on 1 July 2000;

    * the payment must be paid to the Commissioner by the end of the 21st day after the end of the quarter.

      * (b) the quarter ends on 31st March or 30th June of 2001;

    * the payment must be paid to the Commissioner by the end of the 28th day after the end of that quarter.

       * 1485	Other laws do not exempt from TFN withholding tax

##### Subdivision 14A--Noncash benefits

##### 141  Object of this Subdivision

    * The object of this Subdivision is: 

      * (a) to put entities that provide *noncash benefits, and entities that receive them, in a position similar to their position under Division 12 if payments of money had been made instead of the noncash benefits being provided; and

      * (b) in that way, to prevent entities from avoiding their obligations under Division 12 by providing noncash benefits.

##### 145  Provider of noncash benefit must pay amount to the Commissioner if payment would be subject to withholding

    * (1) An entity (the **_payer_**) must pay an amount to the Commissioner before providing a *noncash benefit to another entity (the **_recipient_**) if Division 12 would require the payer to withhold an amount (the **_notionally withheld amount_**) if, instead of providing the benefit to the recipient, the payer made a payment to the recipient in money equal to the *market value of the benefit when the benefit is provided.

    * (2) The amount to be paid to the Commissioner is equal to the notionally withheld amount.

          * Example: Nick is a building contractor who has entered into a voluntary agreement with Mike for the purposes of section 1255. Nick proposes to give Mike his old utility van (whose market value is $1,000) as payment for work Mike has done for him over a fortnight.

          * If Nick were instead to pay Mike $1,000, Nick would have had to withhold $203 under Division 12 (in accordance with withholding rates current at the time).

          * This section requires Nick to pay $203 to the Commissioner before giving the van to Mike.

    * (3) This section does not apply to providing:

      * (c) the term of the investment does not end during the income year; and

      * (d) section 12140 would have required the *investment body to withhold an amount (the **_TFN withholding amount_**) from a payment of the accrued gain to the investor, if the investment body had made the payment at the end of the income year and section 12150 had not been enacted.

          * Note: Section 202D of the _Income Tax Assessment Act 1936_ lists the investments in connection with which tax file numbers are to be quoted.

    * (2) The amount of *TFN withholding tax is equal to the TFN withholding amount.

    * (3) The *TFN withholding tax is payable jointly and severally by the *investor and the *investment body.

    * (4) However, if the *investment body is the Commonwealth or an *untaxable Commonwealth entity:

      * (a) the *TFN withholding tax is payable by the *investor; and

      * (b) the investor is taken to have authorised the investment body to pay the TFN withholding tax on the investor's behalf.

    * (5) The *TFN withholding tax is due and payable at the end of 21 days after the end of the income year referred to in paragraph (1)(a).

          * Note 1: When it is due and payable, the TFN withholding tax is payable to the Commissioner: see paragraph 2555(1)(b).

          * Note 2: An entity by whom it is payable must pay it to the Commissioner in accordance with Subdivision 16B: see subsection 1670(3). If any of it remains unpaid, the entity is liable to pay general interest charge: see section 1680.

    * (1) The *investment body may recover from the *investor as a debt any of the *TFN withholding tax that it pays.

    * (2) The *investment body is entitled to set off an amount that it can recover from the *investor under this section against:

      * (a) a debt due by it to the investor; or

      * (b) an amount that is accruing to the investor, or stands to the investor's credit, in respect of the *Part VA investment, even if the amount is not yet due.

##### 1465  Application of rules in Division 18

    * These provisions: 

      * (a) subsection 1815(1) and sections 1820 and 1825 (about credits for amounts withheld from withholding payments); and

    * apply as if any of the *TFN withholding tax that has been paid were an amount withheld under subsection 12140(1) from a *withholding payment covered by that subsection and made to the *investor during:

      * (c) unless the *investor has adopted (under section 18 of the _Income Tax Assessment Act 1936_) an accounting period ending on a day other than 30 June--the income year referred to in paragraph 1455(1)(a); or

      * (d) if the investor has adopted such an accounting period--the income year in which the TFN withholding tax is paid.

          * Note: Unless the investor has adopted such an accounting period, the credit under section 1815, 1820 or 1825 will be in respect of the income year before the one in which the TFN withholding tax is paid.

    * If *TFN withholding tax has been overpaid:

      * (a) the Commissioner must refund the amount overpaid; and

    * (1) A provision of a law passed before the commencement of this section that purports to exempt an entity from liability to pay *TFN withholding tax, or to pay taxes that include TFN withholding tax, does not exempt that entity from liability to pay TFN withholding tax.

    * (2) A provision of a law passed at or after the commencement of this section that purports to exempt an entity from liability to pay taxes under the laws of the Commonwealth, or to pay certain taxes under those laws that include *TFN withholding tax, is not to be interpreted as exempting the entity from liability to pay TFN withholding tax, unless it specifically mentions TFN withholding tax.

##### Guide to Division 15

##### 151  What this Division is about

    * This Division is mainly about how to work out how much an entity must withhold under Division 12.

    * In most cases, the entity will need to use either the Commissioner's withholding schedules or the regulations.

    * The entity will also need to take into account a TFN declaration or declaration under section 1550 it has been given because, under the schedules and regulations, the declaration may affect how to calculate the amount to withhold.

    * This Division also deals with when an individual can make such a declaration (other than a TFN declaration) so as to change the amount that must be withheld from payments to the individual.

If the Commissioner does so, the amount is varied accordingly.

          * Note 1: Section 12140 is about a payment arising from an investment where the recipient does not quote its tax file number (or, in some cases, its ABN).

          * Note 2: Sections 12175 and 12180 are about a payment of the income of a closely held trust to a beneficiary, where the beneficiary does not quote the beneficiary's tax file number.

    * (2) The Commissioner's power to vary an amount includes the power to reduce the amount to nil.

    * (3) A variation must be made by a written notice:

      * (a) if it applies to a particular entity--that is given to that entity; or

##### Guide to Division 45

##### 451  What this Division is about

    * If you have business or investment income, you must pay instalments towards your income tax liability. However, you do not have to do so unless the Commissioner has given you an instalment rate. Generally, instalments are payable for each quarter of your income year. Alternatively, instalments could be payable monthly or annually.

    * Your instalments may be based on your previous year's income tax liability and notified to you by the Commissioner, or on your estimate of your income tax liability for the current income year. (In this case, you are a quarterly payer who pays on the basis of GDP adjusted notional tax). Generally, four quarterly instalments are payable annually on this basis, but you may only be required to pay two.

    * If you are not eligible to pay instalments on that basis, or if you are so eligible but choose not to do so, you must work out the amount of your quarterly instalment by multiplying your instalment income for an instalment quarter by the rate the Commissioner gave you, or by a rate you choose yourself. (In this case, you are a quarterly payer who pays on the basis of instalment income).

    * If your business or investment income exceeds a certain limit, you may have to pay an instalment after the end of each month. (In this case, you are a monthly payer).

    * If you are not required to be registered for GST purposes, you may be able to choose to pay an annual instalment after the end of the income year. (In this case, you are an annual payer).

    * The amount of annual instalment can be your instalment income for the income year multiplied by the rate the Commissioner gave you, or an amount based on your previous year's income tax liability and notified to you by the Commissioner, or your own estimate of your income tax liability for the income year.

##### Subdivision 45A--Basic rules

##### Table of sections

       * 455	Object of this Part

       * 4510	Application of Part

       * 4515	Liability for instalments

       * 4520	Information to be given to the Commissioner by certain payers

       * 4525	Penalty for failure to notify Commissioner

       * 4530	Credit for instalments payable

##### 455  Object of this Part

    * (1) The object of this Part is to ensure the efficient collection of:

      * (a) income tax; and

      * (b) *Medicare levy; and

      * (ca) amounts of liabilities to the Commonwealth under Chapter 4 of the _Higher Education Support Act 2003_; and

      * (cd) amounts of liabilities to the Commonwealth under Chapter 3 of the _Trade Support Loans Act 2014_; and

      * (d) amounts of liabilities to the Commonwealth under Part 2B.3 of the _Social Security Act 1991_; and

      * (e) amounts of liabilities to the Commonwealth under Division 6 of Part 4A of the _Student Assistance Act 1973_;

    * through the application of the principles set out in the rest of this section.

    * (2) As you earn *instalment income, you pay instalments after the end of each *instalment quarter worked out on the basis of your instalment income for that quarter if you are required or choose to work out your instalment on this basis. However, you may be able to pay an amount notified by the Commissioner. (There are exceptions to this).

    * (2A) Alternatively:

      * (a) you may be required to pay instalments after the end of each *instalment month worked out on the basis of your instalment income for that month; or

      * (b) you may be able to choose to pay an annual instalment for the income year.

    * (3) The total of your instalments for an income year is as close as possible to the total of your liabilities for the income year that are covered by subsection (1), except so far as the amounts of those liabilities are attributable to a *net capital gain. (The exception does not apply to the entities listed in subsections 45120(2) and (2A) or the net capital gains specified in subsection 45120(2B).)

    * (4) Consequently, the additional amounts you have to pay to discharge those liabilities, after an assessment of your income tax for the income year is made, are as low as possible.

    * (5) If you are a *quarterly payer who pays on the basis of instalment income, the amount of each of your instalments for an income year is the same proportion (as nearly as possible, subject to the principles in subsections (3) and (4)) of the total of those instalments as your *instalment income for that *instalment quarter is of your total instalment income for the income year.

    * (5A) If you are a *monthly payer, the amount of each of your instalments for an income year is the same proportion (as nearly as possible, subject to the principles in subsections (3) and (4)) of the total of those instalments as your *instalment income for that *instalment month is of your total instalment income for the income year.

    * (6) When instalments are payable, and how their amount is calculated, are the same for different kinds of entities, except as expressly provided.

          * Note: Subdivision 45P penalises an entity whose tax position, so far as it relates to PAYG instalments and related matters, is altered by a scheme that is inconsistent with the object of this Part.

##### 4510  Application of Part

    * This Part applies to individuals, companies, and the entities listed in items 4 to 10, and 12 and 13, of the table in section 91 of the _Income Tax Assessment Act 1997_ (which lists the entities that must pay income tax).

          * Note 1: Section 45450 provides for how this Part applies to a trustee covered by any of items 4 to 8, and 12 and 13, of the table in section 91 of the _Income Tax Assessment Act 1997_. In most respects, the trust is treated like a company.

          * Note 2: This Part also applies to a trustee covered by item 11 of the table in section 91 of the _Income Tax Assessment Act 1997_, but only to the extent set out in section 45455, and the rest of Subdivision 45N, in this Schedule.

          * Note 4: If the Commissioner withdraws the rate under section 4590, you are not liable to pay further instalments.

    * (2) You must notify the Commissioner in the *approved form and on or before the day when the instalment is due (regardless of whether it is paid). 

    * (2A) If you are a *monthly payer for the period, you must give the notification electronically, unless the Commissioner otherwise approves.

          * Note: A penalty applies if you fail to give the notification electronically as required--see section 28810.

    * (2B) The notification is given electronically if it is transmitted to the Commissioner in an electronic format approved by the Commissioner.

    * Exceptions

##### 4525  Penalty for failure to notify Commissioner 

    * (1) If you fail to notify the Commissioner of an amount as required by section 4520, or you notify an amount that is less than the correct amount, you are liable to pay the *failure to notify penalty on the amount, or on the shortfall, multiplied by the instalment rate that you are required to use to work out the instalment for the period, for each day in the period that:

      * (a) started at the beginning of the day by which the amount was due to be paid; and

      * (b) finishes at the end of the day before you notify the Commissioner of the correct amount, or he or she otherwise becomes aware of it.

##### 4530  Credit for instalments payable

    * (1) You are entitled to a credit when the Commissioner makes an assessment of the income tax you are liable to pay for an income year or an assessment that no income tax is payable by you for an income year.

    * (2) The credit is equal to:

      *  	the total of each instalment payable by you for the income year (even if you have not yet paid it);

    * reduced by: 

      *  	the total of each credit that you have claimed under section 45215 or 45420 in respect of such an instalment.

    * (3) The making of the assessment, and the resulting credit entitlement, do not affect the liability to pay an instalment.

          * Note: How the credit is applied is set out in Division 3 of Part IIB.

    * (4) If:

      * (a) you are a *subsidiary member of a *consolidated group at any time during a *consolidation transitional year for you; and

      * (b) an amount of instalment payable by you, or an amount of credit claimed by you under section 45215 or 45420, is taken into account in working out a credit to which the *head company of that consolidated group is entitled under section 45865 for a consolidation transitional year for the head company;

    * that amount, to the extent to which it is so taken into account under that section, is not to be taken into account in working out any credit to which you are entitled under this section for any year.

       * 45215	Credit on using varied rate in certain cases

##### 45200  Application

    * (1) This Subdivision applies if you are a *quarterly payer who pays on the basis of instalment income at the end of an *instalment quarter.

    * (2) If you are a *monthly payer, this Subdivision has effect in relation to you in respect of an *instalment month in the same way in which it has effect in relation to a *quarterly payer in respect of an *instalment quarter.

##### 45205  Choosing a varied instalment rate

    * (1) You may choose an instalment rate for working out under section 45110 the amount of your instalment for an *instalment quarter in an income year.

    * (2) If you do so, you must use that instalment rate to work out the amount of that instalment. (You cannot later choose another instalment rate for working out that amount.)

          * Note 1: If choosing a rate leads you to pay an instalment that is too low, you may be liable to general interest charge under section 45230. 

          * Note 2: If you choose a rate under this section, you must use it even if the Commissioner later gives you a new instalment rate.

    * (3) You must also use that instalment rate to work out the amount of the instalment that you are liable to pay for each later *instalment quarter in that income year, unless you choose another instalment rate under subsection (1) for working out that amount.

          * Note 1: If you choose a rate under this section, you must use it even if the Commissioner later gives you a new instalment rate.

          * Note 2: If a rate you have chosen for an instalment quarter is not appropriate for a later instalment quarter in the same income year, you should choose another rate under subsection (1) for the later quarter. If the earlier rate is too low, you may be liable to general interest charge under section 45230.

    * (4) However, for working out under section 45110 the amount of your instalment for an *instalment quarter in a later income year, you must use the most recent instalment rate given to you by the Commissioner before the end of that quarter, unless you again choose another instalment rate under subsection (1).

    * (5) Subsection (6) applies if you are a monthly payer.

    * (6) Treat the references in subsections (1) and (4) to section 45110 as instead being references to section 45114.

##### 45210  Notifying Commissioner of varied instalment rate

    * If you work out the amount of an instalment using an instalment rate you have chosen under section 45205, you must specify that rate in the notice about your instalment income that you must give the Commissioner under section 4520.

##### 45215  Credit on using varied rate in certain cases 

    * (1) You are entitled to claim a credit if: 

      * (a) the amount of your instalment for an *instalment quarter (the **_current quarter_**) in an income year is to be worked out using an instalment rate you chose under section 45205; and

      * (b) that rate is lower than the instalment rate you used to work out the amount of your instalment for the previous instalment quarter (if any) in the same income year; and

      * (c) the amount worked out using the method statement is greater than nil.

Method statement

        * Step 1.	Add up the instalments you are liable to pay for the earlier *instalment quarters in the income year (even if you have not yet paid all of them).

        * Step 2.	Subtract from the step 1 amount each earlier credit that you have claimed under this section or section 45420 in respect of the income year.

        * Step 3.	Multiply the total of your *instalment income for those earlier *instalment quarters by the instalment rate to be used for the current quarter.

        * Step 4.	Subtract the step 3 amount from the step 2 amount.

        * Step 5.	If the result is a positive amount, it is the amount of the credit you can claim.

    * (2) A claim for a credit must be made in the *approved form on or before the day on which the instalment for the current quarter is due.

          * Note: How the credit is applied is set out in Division 3 of Part IIB.

    * (3) The credit entitlement does not affect your liability to pay an instalment.

    * Period for which reduction has effect

    * (5) The reduction has effect for each day in the period that:

      * (a) started at the beginning of the day by which the instalment for the later quarter was due to be paid; and

      * (b) finishes at the end of the last day on which, at the end of the day, any of the following remains unpaid:

        * (i) the unpaid amount;

        * (ii) general interest charge on the unpaid amount.

##### 45240  Commissioner may remit general interest charge 

    * The Commissioner may, if he or she is satisfied that because special circumstances exist it would be fair and reasonable to do so, remit the whole or any part of any *general interest charge payable under subsection 45230(2) or 45232(2) or subsection 45235(2) or (3).

      * (b) the holding trust is a trust of the kind covered by subsection 45280(6); and

      * (c) the beneficiary's or beneficiaries' absolute entitlement exists at all times while the holding trust is in existence;

    * the beneficiary or beneficiaries count as persons who hold units in the unit trust, and the trustee of the holding trust does not.

##### 45286  Instalment income includes distributions by certain managed investment trusts

    * Your **_instalment income_** for a period includes trust income or trust capital that a trust distributes to you, or applies for your benefit, during that period if:

      * (a) the income or capital is not included in your instalment income under section 45280 or 45285; and

      * (b) the trust satisfies the condition in paragraph 12400(1)(a) in relation to the income year that is or includes that period; and

      * (c) the trust is:

        * (i) a *managed investment trust for that income year; or

        * (ii) treated as a managed investment trust for that income year for the purposes of Division 275 of the _Income Tax Assessment Act 1997_; and

      * (d) the trust meets the requirement in section 275110 of that Act throughout the income year.

    * (It does not matter whether the trust income or trust capital is included in your assessable income for the income year that is or includes that period.)

##### 45287  When trusts are disqualified due to concentrated ownership

    * Concentrated ownership

    * (1) This section applies to a trust if an individual holds, or up to 20 individuals hold between them directly or indirectly and for their own benefit, interests in the trust:

      * (a) carrying *fixed entitlements to:

        * (i) at least 75% of the trust's income; or

        * (ii) at least 75% of the trust's capital; or

      * (b) if beneficiaries of the trust have a right to vote in respect of activities of the trust--carrying at least 75% of those voting rights.

    * Single individual

    * (2) Subsection (1) operates as if all of these were a single individual:

      * (a) an individual, whether or not the individual holds interests in the trust; and

      * (b) the individual's *associates; and

      * (c) for any interests in respect of which other individuals are nominees of the individual or of the individual's associates--those other individuals.

    * Concentrated ownership--potential due to possible variation of rights etc.

    * (3) This section also applies to a trust if, because of:

      * (a) any provision in the trust's constituent document, or in any contract, agreement or instrument:

        * (i) authorising the variation or abrogation of rights attaching to any of the interests in the trust; or

        * (ii) relating to the conversion, cancellation, extinguishment or redemption of any of those interests; or

      * (b) any contract, *arrangement, option or instrument under which a person has power to acquire any of those interests; or

      * (c) any power, authority or discretion in a person in relation to the rights attaching to any of those interests;

    * it is reasonable to conclude that the rights attaching to any of the interests are capable of being varied or abrogated in such a way (even if they are not in fact varied or abrogated in that way) that, directly or indirectly, the trust would be disqualified under subsection (1).

    * Tracing

    * (4) In applying this section:

      * (a) if a *complying superannuation fund, *approved deposit fund or *superannuation fund for foreign residents has more than 50 members and has, directly or indirectly, a *fixed entitlement to any of the trust's income or capital--that entitlement is taken to be held by more than 20 individuals for their own benefit; and

      * (b) if a complying superannuation fund, approved deposit fund or superannuation fund for foreign residents has 50 or fewer members and has, directly or indirectly, a fixed entitlement to any of the trust's income or capital--each of the members is taken to have a share of that entitlement, in equal proportions, for his or her own benefit.

##### 45288  Resident investment trusts for beneficiaries who are absolutely entitled

      * (a) the trust is a resident unit trust within the meaning of section 102Q of the _Income Tax Assessment Act 1936_; and

      * (b) the trust is of the kind covered by subsection 45280(6) in this Schedule; and

      * (d) all of the trust's beneficiaries became beneficiaries as a result of a public offer to invest in the trust; and

      * (e) either:

        * (i) the trust has 50 or more beneficiaries; or

        * (ii) if the trustee of the trust is also the trustee of one or more other trusts that satisfy paragraphs (a), (b), (c) and (d) of this section--all those trusts together have a total of 50 or more beneficiaries.

##### 45290  Exceptions to exclusion of trust capital gains from beneficiary's instalment income

    * (1) This section sets out cases where paragraph (b) of the definition of **_your assessable income from the trust for the last income year_** in subsection 45280(2) does _not_ apply.

    * (2) It does not apply in the case of:

      * (a) a *complying approved deposit fund or a *noncomplying approved deposit fund for the income year that is or includes the current period; or

      * (b) a *complying superannuation fund or a *noncomplying superannuation fund for that year; or

##### Subdivision 45J--How Commissioner works out your instalment rate and notional tax

##### Table of sections

       * 45320	Working out instalment rate

       * 45325	Working out your _notional tax_

       * _45330	Working out your _adjusted taxable income_

       * _45335	Working out your _adjusted withholding income_

       * _45340	_Adjusted tax_ on adjusted taxable income or on adjusted withholding income

##### 45320  Working out instalment rate

    * (1) Except as provided by section 45775, an instalment rate that the Commissioner gives you must be the percentage worked out to 2 decimal places (rounding up if the third decimal place is 5 or more) using the formula:

    * However, the instalment rate must be a nil rate if either component of the formula is nil.

    * (2) For the purposes of the formula in subsection (1):

    * **_base assessment instalment income_** means so much of your assessable income, as worked out for the purposes of the *base assessment, as the Commissioner determines is *instalment income for the *base year.

    * (3) The **_base assessment_** is the latest assessment for your most recent income year for which an assessment has been made. However, if the Commissioner is satisfied that there is a later income year for which you do not have a taxable income, the **_base assessment_** is the latest return or other information from which an assessment for that income year would have been made.

    * (4) The **_base year_** is the income year to which the *base assessment relates.

    * (5) When the Commissioner gives you the instalment rate, he or she must also notify you of the amount of your *notional tax, as worked out for the purposes of working out the instalment rate.

    * (6) The Commissioner may incorporate notice of the instalment rate and the amount of your *notional tax in notice of your assessment.

##### 45325  Working out your notional tax

    * Notional tax if you have no withholding income

    * (1) Your **_notional tax_** is your *adjusted tax (worked out under section 45340) on your *adjusted taxable income (worked out under section 45330) for the *base year.

    * Notional tax if you have noTFN contributions income

    * (1A) In working out the **_notional tax_** of a *complying superannuation fund, *noncomplying superannuation fund or *RSA provider for the *base year, assume that the entity had no *noTFN contributions income for the base year and that the entity was not entitled to a *tax offset for the base year under Subdivision 295J of the _Income Tax Assessment Act 1997_.

    * Notional tax if you have withholding income

    * (2) However, your **_notional tax_** (as worked out under subsection (1)) is reduced if your assessable income for the *base assessment includes amounts in respect of *withholding payments (except *nonquotation withholding payments).

    * (3) It is reduced (but not below nil) by your *adjusted tax (worked out under section 45340) on your *adjusted withholding income (worked out under section 45335) for the *base year.

    * Commissioner may take into account effect of the law, as applying to income years after base year

    * (4) For the purposes of working out your *notional tax, the Commissioner may work out an amount as if provisions of an Act or regulations, as they may reasonably be expected to apply for the purposes of your assessment for a later income year, had applied for the purposes of the *base assessment.

    * Commissioner may take into account proposed changes to the law so as to reduce instalment rate

    * (5) For the purposes of working out your *notional tax, the Commissioner may work out an amount as if provisions of an Act or regulations that, in the Commissioner's opinion, are likely to be enacted or made had applied for the purposes of the *base assessment. But the Commissioner may do so only if, as a result, the instalment rate given to you is reduced.

    * (6) If the *base year is the income year immediately preceding the income year in which 1 July 2000 occurred, subsections (4) and (5) apply for the purpose of working out the *base assessment instalment income of a *life insurance company in the same way as they apply for the purpose of working out such a company's *notional tax.

##### 45330  Working out your adjusted taxable income

    * (1) Your **_adjusted taxable income_** for the *base year is your total assessable income for the *base assessment, reduced by:

      * (a) any *net capital gain included in that assessable income; and

      * (b) your deductions for the base year (except *tax losses), as used in making that assessment; and

      * (c) the amount of any tax loss, to the extent that it is *unutilised at the end of the base year.

    *  Exception: superannuation entities and net capital gains

    * (2) Paragraph (1)(a) does not apply in the case of:

      * (a) a *complying approved deposit fund or a *noncomplying approved deposit fund for the *base year; or

      * (b) a *complying superannuation fund or a *noncomplying superannuation fund for that year; or

      * (c) a *pooled superannuation trust for that year; or

      * (d) an *FHSA trust for that year.

    * Special rule for some entities

    * (2A) If an entity:

      * (a) has *tax losses transferred to it under Subdivision 707A of the _Income Tax Assessment Act 1997_; or

      * (b) is a *corporate tax entity at any time during the *base year;

    * the **_adjusted taxable income_** of the entity for the base year is worked out under subsection (1) as if paragraph (1)(c) were replaced by the following provision:

      * (c) the lesser of the following amounts:

        * (i) the amount of any tax loss, to the extent that it is *unutilised at the end of the base year;

        * (ii) the amount of the deductions for tax losses used in making your *base assessment.

    * Amounts assessable under Subdivision 250E of the Income Tax Assessment Act 1997

    * (2AA) To avoid doubt, paragraph (1)(a) does not apply to a *net capital gain that is included in your assessable income under Subdivision 250E of the _Income Tax Assessment Act 1997_.

    * Special rule for life insurance companies

    * (3) The **_adjusted taxable income_** of a *life insurance company for the *base year is worked out as follows:

Method statement

        * Step 1.	Recalculate the taxable income of the *ordinary class for the *base assessment on the basis that it did not include any *net capital gain.

        * Step 2.	Add to the step 1 result the deductions for *tax losses of the *ordinary class that were used in making the *base assessment.

        * Step 3.	Reduce the step 2 result by the lesser of the following amounts:

          * (a) the amount of any *tax losses of the *ordinary class, to the extent that they are *unutilised at the end of the *base year;

          * (b) deductions for tax losses of the ordinary class that were used in making the *base assessment.

        * Step 4.	Add to the step 3 result the taxable income of the *complying superannuation/FHSA class for the *base assessment.

        * Step 5.	Add to the step 4 result the deductions for *tax losses of the *complying superannuation/FHSA class that were used in making the *base assessment.

        * Step 6.	Reduce the step 5 result by the lesser of the following amounts:

          * (a) the amount of any *tax losses of the *complying superannuation/FHSA class, to the extent that tthey are *unutilised at the end of the *base year;

          * (b) deductions for tax losses of the complying superannuation/FHSA class that were used in making the *base assessment.

        * The result of this step is the **_adjusted taxable income_** of the company for the *base year.

##### 45335  Working out your adjusted withholding income

    * Your **_adjusted withholding income_** for the *base year is:

      *  	the total of the amounts included in your assessable income for the *base assessment in respect of *withholding payments (except *nonquotation withholding payments);

    * reduced by: 

      *  	your deductions for that year, as used in making that assessment, to the extent that they reasonably relate to those amounts.

##### 45340  Adjusted tax on adjusted taxable income or on adjusted withholding income

    * Your **_adjusted tax _**on your *adjusted taxable income, or on your *adjusted withholding income, for the *base year is worked out as follows:

Method statement

          * (h) Subdivision 418B of the _Income Tax Assessment Act 1997_ (the exploration development incentive tax offset).

        * Step 2.	The *Medicare levy payable on your *adjusted taxable income, or on your *adjusted withholding income, for the *base year is worked out disregarding sections 8B, 8C, 8D, 8E, 8F and 8G of the _Medicare Levy Act 1986_ (which increase Medicare levy in certain cases).

        * Step 3.	The amount (if any) that you would have been liable to pay for the *base year in respect of an *accumulated HELP debt if your taxable income for the base year had been your *adjusted taxable income, or your *adjusted withholding income, for that year is worked out. 

        * Step 3AC.	The amount (if any) that you would have been liable to pay for the *base year in respect of an *accumulated TSL debt if your taxable income for the base year had been your *adjusted taxable income, or your *adjusted withholding income, for that year is worked out.

    * **_original amount_** means the amount that, apart from subsection (2), would be your *adjusted taxable income for the *base year, or your *adjusted withholding income for the *base year, as appropriate.

    * **_GDP adjustment_** means:

      * (aa) if the current year is the 201112 income year--4%; or

##### 45410  Working out amount of instalment--payers of 4 quarterly instalments

    * (1A) This section applies if you are a *quarterly payer who pays 4 instalments annually on the basis of GDPadjusted notional tax at the end of an *instalment quarter in an income year (the **_current year_**).

    * (1) For the purposes of paragraph 45112(1)(b) or (c), the amount of your instalment for that *instalment quarter in an income year is:

      * (a) the amount worked out, in accordance with this section, on the basis of the estimate of your *benchmark tax for that income year that section 45415 requires to be used, if that amount is positive; or

      * (b) otherwise--nil.

          * Note: If the amount is negative, you can claim a credit under section 45420.

    * First instalment quarter

    * (2) If the *instalment quarter is the first in that income year for which you are liable to pay an instalment, the amount is 25% of the estimate of your *benchmark tax.

    * Second instalment quarter

    * (3) If the *instalment quarter is the second in that income year for which you are liable to pay an instalment, the amount is worked out by subtracting:

      *  	the amount of your instalment under section 45112 for the earlier *instalment quarter in that income year;

    * from: 

      *  	50% of the estimate of your *benchmark tax.

    * Third instalment quarter

    * (4) If the *instalment quarter is the third in that income year for which you are liable to pay an instalment, the amount is worked out using this method statement.

Method statement

        * Step 1.	The total of your instalments under section 45112 for earlier *instalment quarters in that income year is subtracted from 75% of the estimate of your *benchmark tax.

        * Step 2.	If you were entitled to claim a credit under section 45420 for the second of those earlier *instalment quarters, the amount of the credit is added to the step 1 amount.

    * Fourth instalment quarter

    * (5) If the *instalment quarter is the fourth in that income year for which you are liable to pay an instalment, the amount is worked out using this method statement.

Method statement

        * Step 1.	The total of your instalments under section 45112 for earlier *instalment quarters in that income year is subtracted from the estimate of your *benchmark tax.

        * Step 2.	For each credit that you were entitled to claim under section 45420 for any of those earlier *instalment quarters, the amount of the credit is added to the step 1 amount.

##### 45412  Working out amount of instalment--payers of 2 quarterly instalments

    * (1) This section applies if you are a *quarterly payer who pays 2 instalments annually on the basis of GDPadjusted notional tax at the end of an *instalment quarter in an income year.

    * (2) If you are liable to pay an instalment for that quarter, the amount of that instalment for the purposes of paragraph 45112(1)(b) or (c) is:

      * (a) the amount worked out, in accordance with this section, on the basis of the estimate of your *benchmark tax for that income year that section 45415 requires to be used, if that amount is positive; or

      * (b) otherwise--nil.

          * Note: If the amount is negative, you can claim a credit under section 45420.

    * Instalment for third quarter

    * (3) Subject to subsections (5) to (9), the amount of the instalment for the third *instalment quarter in that year is 75% of the estimate of your *benchmark tax.

    * Instalment for fourth quarter

    * (4) Subject to subsections (5) to (9), the amount of the instalment for the fourth *instalment quarter in that year is worked out by subtracting:

      * (a) the amount of your instalment for the earlier instalment quarter in that year;

    * from: 

      * (b) the estimate of your *benchmark tax.

    * You receive instalment rate for the first time in second quarter

    * (5) If the Commissioner gives you an instalment rate for the first time during the second *instalment quarter in the income year, the amount of the instalment for the third *instalment quarter in that year is 50% of the estimate of your *benchmark tax.

    * (6) If the Commissioner gives you an instalment rate for the first time during the second *instalment quarter in the income year, the amount of the instalment for the fourth instalment quarter in that year is worked out by subtracting:

      * (a) the amount of your instalment for the earlier instalment quarter in that year;

    * from: 

      * (b) 75% of the estimate of your *benchmark tax.

    * You receive instalment rate for the first time in third quarter

    * (7) If the Commissioner gives you an instalment rate for the first time during the third *instalment quarter in the income year, the amount of the instalment for the third instalment quarter in that year is 25% of the estimate of your *benchmark tax.

    * (8) If the Commissioner gives you an instalment rate for the first time during the third *instalment quarter in the income year, the amount of the instalment for the fourth instalment quarter in that year is worked out by subtracting:

      * (a) the amount of your instalment for the earlier instalment quarter in that year;

    * from:

    * You receive instalment rate for the first time in fourth quarter

    * (9) If the Commissioner gives you an instalment rate for the first time during the fourth *instalment quarter in the income year, the amount of the instalment for that quarter is 25% of the estimate of your *benchmark tax.

##### 45415  Estimating your benchmark tax

    * (1) If you choose under paragraph 45112(1)(b) to work out the amount of your instalment for an *instalment quarter in an income year on the basis of your estimate of your *benchmark tax for that income year, you must make the estimate on or before the day on which the instalment is due (disregarding subsection 45112(3)).

    * (2) Having done so, you must use that estimate to work out the amount of that instalment. (You cannot later make another estimate for working out that amount.)

          * Note: If your estimate leads you to pay an instalment that is too low, you may be liable to general interest charge under section 45232. 

    * (3) The Commissioner must also use that estimate to work out under this Subdivision the amount of each instalment:

      * (a) that you are liable to pay for a later *instalment quarter in that income year; and

      * (b) whose amount he or she must notify to you under paragraph 45112(1)(c);

    * unless a later application of this subsection requires him or her to use a later estimate you make under subsection (1) of this section.

          * Note: This means that if an estimate you have made is not appropriate for a later instalment quarter in the same income year, you should choose under paragraph 45112(1)(b) to work out the amount of your instalment for that later quarter on the basis of a new estimate under this section. If the instalment that the Commissioner works out on the basis of the earlier estimate is too low, you may be liable to general interest charge under section 45232.

##### 45420  Credit in certain cases where amount of instalment is nil

    * (1) You are entitled to claim a credit if the amount of your instalment for an *instalment quarter (the **_current quarter_**) in an income year is nil because the amount worked out for the current quarter in accordance with section 45410 or 45412 (as appropriate) is negative. The amount of the credit is equal to that amount, expressed as a positive amount.

    * (2) A claim for a credit must be made in the *approved form on or before the day on which the instalment for the current quarter is due.

          * Note: How the credit is applied is set out in Division 3 of Part IIB.

##### 45450  Trustees to whom a single instalment rate is given

    * (1) This Part applies to a trustee covered by any of items 4 to 8, and 12 and 13, of the table in section 91 of the _Income Tax Assessment Act 1997_.

    * (2) Such a trustee is called a **_singlerate trustee_**.

    * (3) This Part applies to the trustee of a trust that is a *corporate unit trust, or a *public trading trust, for an income year as if the trustee had a taxable income for the income year equal to the net income of the trust for the income year.

##### 45455  Trustees to whom several instalment rates are given

    * Trustee previously assessed in respect of beneficiary

    * (1) This Part also applies for an income year (the **_current year_**), to the trustee of a trust, in respect of a beneficiary of the trust, if for a previous income year the trustee of the trust was liable to be assessed, and to pay tax, under subsection 98(1) or (2) of the _Income Tax Assessment Act 1936_ in respect of that beneficiary.

    * (2) However, this Part does not apply for the current year to the trustee in respect of that beneficiary if:

      * (a) for that previous income year the trustee was liable to be assessed, and to pay tax, under subsection 98(1) of the _Income Tax Assessment Act 1936_ in respect of that beneficiary; and

      * (b) that beneficiary will no longer be under a legal disability, or it is reasonable to expect that he or she will no longer be under a legal disability, at the end of the current year.

    * Trustee previously assessed under section 99 or 99A

    * (3) This Part also applies for an income year to the trustee of a trust if for a previous income year the trustee was liable to be assessed, and to pay tax, under section 99 or 99A of the _Income Tax Assessment Act 1936_.

    * Multiple applications of this Part to the same trustee for the same income year

    * (4) The application of this Part for an income year, to the trustee of a trust, in respect of a beneficiary of the trust, because of subsection (1), is distinct from, and additional to, each of the following:

      * (b) the application of this Part for that income year to a beneficiary of the trust.

    * (6) A **_multirate trustee_** is a trustee to whom this Part applies because of this section.

##### 45460  Rest of Subdivision applies only to multirate trustees

    * The rest of this Subdivision applies to you if, and only if, you are a *multirate trustee. (It applies instead of Subdivisions 45J and 45K.)

          * Note: Except as provided in the rest of this Subdivision or elsewhere, this Part applies according to its terms to a multirate trustee. For example, a multirate trustee can become an annual payer under Subdivision 45E.

##### 45465  Meaning of instalment income

    * Your **_instalment income_** for a period is the whole of the trust's *instalment income for that period.

##### 45468  Multirate trustee may pay quarterly instalments

    * Subdivision 45D (about quarterly payers) applies to you in the same way as it applies to an individual.

          * Note: This means that a multirate trustee may pay instalments on the basis of GDPadjusted notional tax if the trustee otherwise satisfies the relevant test that applies to an individual.

##### How Commissioner works out instalment rate and notional tax for a multirate trustee

##### 45470  Working out instalment rate

    * (1) An instalment rate that the Commissioner gives you must be the percentage worked out to 2 decimal places (rounding up if the third decimal place is 5 or more) using the formula:

    * However, the instalment rate must be a nil rate if either component of the formula is nil.

    * (2) For the purposes of the formula in subsection (1):

    * **_base assessment instalment income_** means so much of the assessable income of the trust, as worked out for the purposes of the *base assessment, as the Commissioner determines is *instalment income of the trust for the *base year.

    * (3) The **_base assessment_** is the latest assessment for the most recent income year for which an assessment has been made of the tax payable by you:

      * (a) under subsection 98(1) or (2) of the _Income Tax Assessment Act 1936_ in respect of the same beneficiary; or

      * (b) under section 99 or 99A of the _Income Tax Assessment Act 1936_;

    * as appropriate.

    * (4) However, if the Commissioner is satisfied that there is a later income year for which no tax is payable as mentioned in subsection (3), the **_base assessment_** is the latest return or other information from which an assessment of tax so payable for that income year would have been made.

    * (5) The **_base year_** is the income year to which the *base assessment relates.

##### 45473  Commissioner must notify you of notional tax

    * (1) When the Commissioner gives you the instalment rate, he or she must also notify you of the amount of your *notional tax, as worked out for the purposes of working out the instalment rate.

    * (2) The Commissioner may incorporate notice of the instalment rate and the amount of your *notional tax in notice of your assessment.

##### 45475  Working out your notional tax

    * Notional tax if no withholding income

    * (1) Your **_notional tax_** is your *adjusted tax (worked out under section 45340) on your *adjusted taxable income (worked out under section 45480) for the *base year.

    * Notional tax if trust has withholding income

    * (2) However, your **_notional tax_** (as worked out under subsection (1)) is reduced if the trust's assessable income for the *base assessment includes amounts in respect of *withholding payments (except *nonquotation withholding payments).

    * (3) It is reduced (but not below nil) by your *adjusted tax (worked out under section 45340) on your *adjusted withholding income (worked out under section 45485) for the *base year.

    * Commissioner may take into account actual and proposed changes to the law 

    * (4) Subsections 45325(4) and (5) apply for the purposes of working out your *notional tax under this section.

##### 45480  Working out your adjusted taxable income 

    * (1) Your **_adjusted taxable income_** for the *base year is worked out using the formula:

    * (2) For the purposes of the formula in subsection (1):

    * **_adjusted net income of the trust_** means the net income of the trust, as worked out for the purposes of the *base assessment and:

      * (a) reduced by any *net capital gain included in the trust's assessable income as so worked out; and

      * (b) increased by any deductions for *tax losses that were made in so working out that net income; and

      * (c) reduced by the amount of any tax loss, to the extent that it is *unutilised at the end of the *base year.

    * **_reduced net income of the trust_** means the net income of the trust, as worked out for the purposes of the *base assessment and reduced by any *net capital gain included in the trust's assessable income as so worked out.

    * **_relevant share_** means the *reduced beneficiary's share, or the *reduced no beneficiary's share, as appropriate, of the net income of the trust, as worked out for the purposes of the *base assessment.

##### 45483  Meaning of reduced beneficiary's share and reduced no beneficiary's share

    * (1) If the trustee of a trust is liable to be assessed, and to pay tax, for an income year under subsection 98(1) or (2) of the _Income Tax Assessment Act 1936_ in respect of a particular beneficiary, the **_reduced beneficiary's share_** of the net income is the amount on which the trustee is so liable to be assessed and to pay tax, except so much of that amount as is attributable to a *net capital gain included in the trust's assessable income for that income year.

    * (2) If the trustee of a trust is liable to be assessed, and to pay tax, for an income year under section 99 or 99A of the _Income Tax Assessment Act 1936_, the **_reduced no beneficiary's share_** of the net income is the amount on which the trustee is so liable to be assessed and to pay tax, except so much of that amount as is attributable to a *capital gain made by the trust during that income year.

##### 45485  Working out your adjusted withholding income

    * (1) Your **_adjusted withholding income_** for the *base year is worked out using the formula:

    * (2) For the purposes of the formula in subsection (1):

    * **_net withholding income of the trust_** means:

      *  	the total of the amounts included in the trust's assessable income for the *base assessment in respect of *withholding payments (except *nonquotation withholding payments);

    * reduced by: 

      *  	the trust's deductions for that year, as used in making that assessment, to the extent that they reasonably relate to those amounts.

    * **_reduced net income of the trust_** has the meaning given by subsection 45480(2).

    * **_relevant share_** has the meaning given by subsection 45480(2).

##### How Commissioner works out benchmark instalment rate and benchmark tax for a multirate trustee

##### 45525  When Commissioner works out benchmark instalment rate and benchmark tax

    * (1) The Commissioner may work out your *benchmark instalment rate for an income year (the **_variation year_**) if, under section 45205, you choose an instalment rate to work out the amount of your instalment for an *instalment quarter in that year.

    * (2) The Commissioner may work out your *benchmark tax for an income year (the **_variation year_**) if, under paragraph 45112(1)(b) or (c), the amount of your instalment for an *instalment quarter in an income year is worked out on the basis of your estimate of your *benchmark tax for that income year.

    * (3) The Commissioner may work out your *benchmark tax for an income year (the **_variation year_**) if, under paragraph 45115(1)(c), you estimate the amount of your annual instalment for that year.

##### 45530  How Commissioner works out benchmark instalment rate

    * (1) Your **_benchmark instalment rate_** for the variation year is the percentage worked out to 2 decimal places (rounding up if the third decimal place is 5 or more) using the formula:

    * However, your **_benchmark instalment rate_** is a nil rate if either component of the formula is nil.

    * (2) For the purposes of the formula in subsection (1):

    * **_variation year instalment income_** means so much of the trust's assessable income for the variation year as the Commissioner determines is *instalment income for that year.

##### 45535  Working out your benchmark tax

    * Benchmark tax if no withholding income

    * (1) Your **_benchmark tax_** is your *adjusted assessed tax (worked out under section 45375) on the *reduced beneficiary's share, or the *reduced no beneficiary's share, as appropriate, of the net income of the trust for the variation year.

    * Benchmark tax if you had withholding income

    * (2) However, your **_benchmark tax_** (as worked out under subsection (1)) is reduced if the trust's assessable income for the variation year includes amounts in respect of *withholding payments.

    * (3) It is reduced (but not below nil) by the total amount of the credits to which you are entitled for the variation year under section 1825 (for amounts withheld from the withholding payments).

    * (3) Next, determine your *hypothetical tax position for the same income year (apart from this Subdivision).

    * (4) Then compare each *component of the 2 positions. If the amount of that component of the actual *tax position is _lower_ than the amount of that component of the *hypothetical tax position, the difference between the 2 amounts is a **_tax benefit_** that you get from the *scheme.

          * Note 1: The difference between the 2 amounts is _not _a tax benefit to the extent that it is attributable to certain things for which the income tax law expressly provides. See section 45635.

          * Note 2: An entity may get 2 or more tax benefits from the same scheme. One reason is that the scheme may affect 2 or more components of the entity's tax position for an income year. Another reason is that the scheme may affect the tax position for 2 or more income years.

##### 45610  What is your tax position for an income year?

    * Your **_tax position_** for an income year consists of a number of **_components_**. The table sets out each component, and how to work out the amount of the component.

          * Example: A scheme results in X Pty Ltd being able to choose to be an annual payer for the 200001 income year.

          * The following table shows the actual tax position of X Pty Ltd for that year, and also its hypothetical tax position as defined in section 45615. X Pty Ltd has got 4 tax benefits from the scheme: one for each of the 4 instalment quarters.

##### 45615  What is your hypothetical tax position for an income year?

    * Your **_hypothetical tax position_** for an income year is what would have been, or what could reasonably be expected to have been, your *tax position for the income year if the *scheme had not been entered into or carried out.

##### 45620  Amount on which GIC is payable, and period for which it is payable

    * (1) You are liable to pay the *general interest charge on twice the *tax benefit mentioned in paragraph 45600(1)(a).

          * Note 1: To the extent that you also got a tax detriment from the scheme, you get a credit: see section 45625.

          * Note 2: In special circumstances the Commissioner can remit some or all of the general interest charge: see section 45640.

    * (2) You are liable to pay the charge for each day in the period that:

      * (a) started at the beginning of the day by which your instalment for the period mentioned in the applicable item of the table in section 45610 was due to be paid, or would have been due to be paid if you had been liable to pay an instalment for that period; and

      * (b) finishes at the end of the day on which your assessed tax for the income year is due to be paid.

    * (3) The Commissioner must give you written notice of the *general interest charge to which you are liable under subsection (1). You must pay the charge within 14 days after the notice is given to you.

    * (4) If any of the *general interest charge to which you are liable under subsection (1) remains unpaid at the end of the 14 days referred to in subsection (3), you are also liable to pay the general interest charge on the unpaid amount for each day in the period that:

      * (a) starts at the end of those 14 days; and

      * (b) finishes at the end of the last day on which, at the end of the day, any of the following remains unpaid:

        * (i) the unpaid amount;

        * (ii) general interest charge on the unpaid amount.

##### 45625  Credit if you also got a tax detriment from the scheme

    * (1) You are entitled to a credit if:

      * (a) you are liable to pay *general interest charge under section 45620 because you got one or more *tax benefits from the *scheme; and

      * (b) the Commissioner is satisfied that:

        * (i) you got a *tax detriment from the scheme; and

        * (ii) the tax detriment relates to a *component of your *tax position for an income year, and that component is covered by section 45610.

    * (It does not matter whether that income year is the same as the one referred to in section 45600.)

          * Note: How the credit is applied is set out in Division 3 of Part IIB.

    * (2) The credit is equal to the *general interest charge on twice the amount of the *tax detriment for each day in the period that:

      * (a) started at the beginning of the day by which your instalment for the period mentioned in the item of the table in section 45610 that applies for the purposes of working out the amount of the tax detriment:

        * (i) was due to be paid; or

        * (ii) would have been due to be paid if you had been liable to pay an instalment for that period; and

      * (b) finishes at the end of the day on which your assessed tax for the income year is due to be paid.

    * (3) However, the credit cannot exceed the total *general interest charge you are liable to pay under section 45620 because you got one or more *tax benefits from the *scheme.

    * Credit for each of 2 or more tax detriments

    * (4) If you get 2 or more *tax detriments from the scheme, subsections (1) and (2) have a separate application to each of them. However, the total of the credits cannot exceed the total *general interest charge referred to in subsection (3).

##### 45630  When do you get a tax detriment from a scheme?

    * (1) This section describes how to work out whether you get a **_tax detriment_** from a *scheme and, if so, the amount of the tax detriment.

    * (2) First, determine your actual *tax position for an income year (apart from this Subdivision).

    * (3) Next, determine your *hypothetical tax position for the same income year (apart from this Subdivision).

    * (4) Then compare each *component of the 2 positions. If the amount of that component of the actual *tax position is _higher_ than the amount of that component of the *hypothetical tax position, the difference between the 2 amounts is a **_tax detriment_** that you get from the *scheme.

          * Example: In the fact situation in the example in section 45610, X Pty Ltd gets a tax detriment from the scheme for the annual instalment component of its tax position for the income year.

          * Note 1: The difference between the 2 amounts is _not _a tax detriment to the extent that it is attributable to certain things for which the income tax law expressly provides. See section 45635.

          * Note 2: An entity may get 2 or more tax detriments from the same scheme. One reason is that the scheme may affect 2 or more components of the entity's tax position for an income year. Another reason is that the scheme may affect the tax position for 2 or more income years.

##### 45635  No tax benefit or detriment results from choice for which income tax law expressly provides

    * Choice under the income tax law generally

    * (1) The difference between the 2 amounts referred to in subsection 45605(4) or 45630(4) is _not_ a *tax benefit or *tax detriment if there would have been no difference between the 2 amounts but for one or more matters covered by subsection (3).

    * (2) The difference between the 2 amounts is _not_ a *tax benefit or *tax detriment to the extent that the difference between the 2 amounts would have been less but for one or more matters covered by subsection (3). 

    * (3) This subsection covers:

      * (a) an entity making an agreement, choice, declaration, election or selection; or

      * (b) an entity giving a notice or exercising an option;

    * for which this Act expressly provides. However, this subsection does _not_ cover an entity doing such a thing under:

      * (c) Subdivision 126B (about CGT rollovers involving certain companies in the same whollyowned group) of the _Income Tax Assessment Act 1997_; or

      * (d) Subdivision 170B of that Act (about transferring a net capital loss between certain companies in the same whollyowned group).

    * Matters excluded in applying subsection (1) or (2)

    * (4) Subsection (1) or (2) does not apply to a matter covered by subsection (3) if an entity entered into or carried out the *scheme (or part of it) for the sole or dominant purpose of creating a circumstance or state of affairs whose existence is necessary for the entity referred to in subsection (3):

      * (a) to make the agreement, choice, declaration, election or selection; or

      * (b) to give the notice or exercise the option.

    * Choice under some CGT provisions

    * (5) The difference between the 2 amounts is _not_ a *tax benefit or *tax detriment if:

      * (a) there would have been no difference between the 2 amounts but for one or more matters covered by subsection (7); and

      * (b) the *scheme consisted wholly of that matter or those matters.

    * (6) Also, the difference between the 2 amounts is _not_ a *tax benefit or *tax detriment to the extent that the difference between the 2 amounts would have been less but for one or more matters covered by subsection (7), but only if the *scheme consisted wholly of that matter or those matters.

    * (7) This subsection covers:

      * (a) a choice made under Subdivision 126B (about CGT rollovers involving certain companies in the same whollyowned group) of the _Income Tax Assessment Act 1997_; or

      * (b) an agreement made under Subdivision 170B of that Act (about transferring a net capital loss between certain companies in the same whollyowned group);

##### 45640  Commissioner may remit general interest charge in special cases

    * (1) The Commissioner may, if he or she is satisfied that because special circumstances exist it would be fair and reasonable to do so, remit the whole or any part of any *general interest charge payable under section 45620.

    * (2) If the Commissioner does so, section 45625 (about credits for tax detriments from schemes) applies, and is taken always to have applied, as if the remitted amount had never been payable.

##### Subdivision 45Q--General rules for consolidated groups

##### Guide to Subdivision 45Q

##### 45700  What this Subdivision is about

    * This Subdivision allows the members of a consolidated group to be treated as a single entity for the purposes of Pay as you go (PAYG) instalments. Generally, the head company of the group is the entity liable to pay PAYG instalments.

    * The PAYG instalments provisions in this Part apply to the head company in much the same way as they apply to any other company. However, the operation of some of these provisions is modified by this Subdivision.

    * This Subdivision also contains special rules to deal with changes in the membership of the group.

          * Note 1: Subdivision 45R contains special rules that apply to members of a consolidated group before they are treated as a single entity for the purposes of this Part. It also contains special rules that affect the operation of this Subdivision (see sections 45880 and 45885).

          * Note 2: Subdivision 45S extends the operation of this Subdivision so that it can apply to members of a MEC group. It contains modifications of this Subdivision for the purposes of that extended operation.

##### Application of Subdivision

##### 45703  Effect of this Subdivision and Subdivision 45R in relation to monthly payers

    * (1) If:

      * (a) a company is the *head company of a *consolidated group; and

      * (b) the company is a *monthly payer;

    * this Subdivision and Subdivision 45R have effect in relation to the company as the head company of the group in respect of an *instalment month in the same way in which they have effect in relation to a company that is a *quarterly payer as the head company of a consolidated group in respect of an *instalment quarter.

    * (2) If:

      * (a) an entity is a *subsidiary member of a *consolidated group; and

      * (b) the entity is a *monthly payer;

    * this Subdivision and Subdivision 45R have effect in relation to the entity in respect of an *instalment month in the same way in which they have effect in relation to an entity that is a *quarterly payer in respect of an *instalment quarter.

    * (3) However, those effects are subject to any modifications set out in those Subdivisions.

          * Note: Subdivision 45S can also have effect in relation to a monthly payer because of the operation of this section and section 45910.

##### 45705  Application of Subdivision to head company

    * Period during which Subdivision applies to head company

    * (1) Subject to sections 45880 and 45885, this Subdivision applies to a company as the *head company of a *consolidated group during the period:

      * (a) starting at the start of the *instalment quarter of the company determined under subsection (2), (3) or (4); and

      * (b) ending:

        * (i) at the end of the instalment quarter of the company determined under paragraph (5)(a) or (b); or

        * (ii) just before the instalment quarter of the company determined under paragraph (5)(c) or (d).

    * When the period begins--initial head company instalment rate

    * (2) This Subdivision starts to apply to a company as the *head company of a *consolidated group at the start of an *instalment quarter under this subsection if, during that quarter, the Commissioner gives the company (as that head company) the *initial head company instalment rate.

          * Note: The operation of this subsection may be affected by section 45885.

    * When the period begins--group created from MEC group

    * (3) This Subdivision starts to apply to a company as the *head company of a *consolidated group at the start of an *instalment quarter (the **_starting quarter_**) under this subsection if all of the following conditions are satisfied:

      * (a) the consolidated group is *created from a *MEC group during the starting quarter;

      * (b) the company is the head company of the consolidated group when the consolidated group is created from the MEC group;

      * (c) either of the following applies:

        * (i) this Subdivision applied, in accordance with Subdivision 45S, to the *provisional head company of the MEC group at the end of the previous instalment quarter;

        * (ii) the Commissioner gives the *initial head company instalment rate to the provisional head company of the MEC group during the starting quarter.

          * Note: For the application of this Subdivision to a provisional head company of a MEC group: see section 45915.

    * When the period begins--new head company

    * (4) This Subdivision starts to apply to a company as the *head company of a *consolidated group at the start of an *instalment quarter (the **_starting quarter_**) under this subsection if all of the following conditions are satisfied:

      * (a) the company is an interposed company mentioned in subsection 61530(2) of the _Income Tax Assessment Act 1997_;

      * (b) the company chooses under that subsection that the consolidated group is to continue in existence at and after the completion time mentioned in that subsection;

      * (c) the completion time occurs during the starting quarter;

      * (d) one of the following subparagraphs applies:

        * (i) this Subdivision applied to the original entity mentioned in that subsection (as the head company of the consolidated group) at the end of the previous instalment quarter;

        * (ii) the Commissioner gives the *initial head company instalment rate to the original entity mentioned in that subsection (as the head company of the consolidated group) during the starting quarter;

        * (iii) the consolidated group is *created from a *MEC group during the starting quarter and this Subdivision applied to the *provisional head company of the MEC group at the end of the previous instalment quarter;

        * (iv) the consolidated group is created from a MEC group during the starting quarter and the Commissioner gives the initial head company instalment rate to the provisional head company of the MEC group during the starting quarter.

    * When the period begins--modified timing for head company that is monthly payer

    * (4A) Subsection (4B) applies if:

      * (a) apart from subsection (4B), this Subdivision starts to apply to a company as the *head company of a *consolidated group at a particular time because of the operation of subsection (2), (3) or (4); and

      * (b) the company is a *monthly payer; and

      * (c) the Commissioner gave the *initial head company instalment rate as mentioned in subsection (2), subparagraph (3)(c)(ii), subparagraph (4)(d)(ii) or subparagraph (4)(d)(iv) in an *instalment month.

    * (4B) Treat subsection (2), (3) or (4) (as the case requires) as providing that this Subdivision starts to apply to the company as the *head company of the group at the start of the _next _*instalment month.

          * Note: For the application of this Subdivision to a monthly payer, see section 45703.

    * When the period ends

    * (5) This Subdivision stops applying to a company as the *head company of a *consolidated group at the earliest of the following times after the company becomes the head company:

      * (a) the end of the *instalment quarter during which the consolidated group ceases to exist (other than because a *MEC group is *created from the consolidated group);

      * (b) the end of the instalment quarter during which the Commissioner is notified of the creation of a MEC group from the consolidated group if the MEC group is created during that instalment quarter;

      * (c) just before the instalment quarter during which the Commissioner is notified of the creation of a MEC group from the consolidated group if the MEC group was created before that instalment quarter;

      * (d) just before the instalment quarter that includes the completion time mentioned in subsection 61530(2) of the_ Income Tax Assessment Act 1997_ where an interposed company mentioned in that subsection chooses under that subsection that the consolidated group is to continue in existence.

          * Note: The operation of this subsection because of paragraph (a) may be affected by section 45880.

    * (6) For the purposes of subsection (5), the Commissioner is notified of the creation of a *MEC group from a *consolidated group when the Commissioner receives a notice of the consolidation of the MEC group under subsection 71940(1) of the _Income Tax Assessment Act 1997_.

    * (7) If this Subdivision stops applying to a company as the *head company of a *consolidated group just before an *instalment quarter under paragraph (5)(c), then, for the purposes of this Part, this Act has effect for the company and other *members of the group as if:

      * (a) the consolidated group had continued to exist until just before the start of that quarter; and

      * (b) the company were the head company of the group until just before the start of that quarter.

    * (8) To avoid doubt, this Subdivision does not apply to a company as the *head company of a *consolidated group for any time at all if:

      * (a) subsection (2), (3) or (4), and subsection (5), would, apart from this subsection, apply to the company; but

      * (b) the time at which this Subdivision would stop applying to the company under subsection (5) is before the time at which this Subdivision would start to apply to the company under subsection (2), (3) or (4).

    * (9) To avoid doubt, and apart from the operation of subsection (7), this Subdivision may apply to a company as the *head company of a *consolidated group at a time when the company is not in fact the head company of the group.

          * Note: An example of this is when an interposed company becomes the new head company of a consolidated group. Under this section and section 45740, this Subdivision may start applying to the company as if it had already become the head company when it is not yet such a company.

##### Usual operation of this Part for consolidated group members

##### 45710  Single entity rule

    * If an entity is a *subsidiary member of a *consolidated group for any period during which this Subdivision applies to the *head company of the group:

      * (a) that entity; and

      * (b) any other subsidiary member of the group;

    * are taken for the purposes of this Part to be parts of that head company (rather than separate entities) during that period.

          * Note: That means, amongst other things, the head company would be liable to pay instalments for that period as if the subsidiary members were parts of the head company.

##### 45715  When instalments are due--modification of section 4561

    * (1) If:

      * (a) the *head company of a *consolidated group is liable to pay an instalment for an *instalment quarter; and

      * (b) this Subdivision applies to the head company during that quarter;

    * then, despite subsection 4561(2), the instalment is due on or before the 21st day of the month after the end of that quarter whether or not the head company is a *deferred BAS payer on that day.

    * (2) Subsection (3) applies if section 45703 applies to the *head company of the *consolidated group (because it is a *monthly payer).

    * (3) Treat the reference in subsection (1) to subsection 4561(2) as instead being a reference to subsection 4567(2).

##### 45720  Head company cannot be an annual payer--modification of section 45140

    * Despite any other provisions in this Part, the *head company of a *consolidated group cannot choose to be an *annual payer under section 45140 while this Subdivision applies to the head company.

          * Note: You stop being an annual payer when this Subdivision starts applying to you as the head company of a consolidated group: see section 45160.

##### Membership changes

##### 45740  Change of head company

    * Object

    * (1) The object of this section (except subsection (8)) is to ensure that, for the purposes of this Part, when a company becomes the new *head company of a *consolidated group:

      * (a) the company inherits the history of the former head company of the group; and

      * (b) the history of the new head company is effectively ignored.

    * (2) This section applies to a *head company of a *consolidated group if:

      * (a) the company is an interposed company mentioned in subsection 45705(4) (an interposed company that chooses under subsection 61530(2) of the _Income Tax Assessment Act 1997_ that the consolidated group is to continue in existence at and after the completion time mentioned in that subsection); and

      * (b) the conditions in subsection 45705(4) are satisfied in relation to the interposed company (whether or not this Subdivision applies to the company as the head company of the group for any period of time).

    * (3) Everything that happened before the completion time in relation to the company (the **_original company_**) that was the *head company of the *consolidated group immediately before the completion time:

      * (a) is taken to have happened in relation to the interposed company instead of in relation to the original company; and

      * (b) is taken to have happened in relation to the interposed company instead of what would (apart from this section) be taken to have happened in relation to the interposed company before the completion time;

    * just as if, at all times before the completion time:

      * (c) the interposed company had been the original company; and

      * (d) the original company had been the interposed company.

    * (4) To avoid doubt, subsection (3) also covers everything that, immediately before the completion time, was taken to have happened in relation to the original company because of:

      * (a) section 7011 of the _Income Tax Assessment Act 1997 _(single entity rule); or

      * (b) section 7015 of that Act (entry history rule); or

      * (c) section 70375 of that Act (effects of an interposed company becoming the *head company of a *consolidated group); or

      * (d) section 71990 of that Act (effects of a change of head company of a *MEC group); or

      * (e) section 45710 in this Schedule (single entity rule for the purposes of this Part), including an application of that section under Subdivision 45S in this Schedule; or

      * (f) this section; or

      * (g) section 45920 in this Schedule (effects of a change of *provisional head company of a MEC group for the purposes of this Part); or

      * (h) one or more previous applications of any of the provisions covered by paragraphs (a) to (g).

    * (5) In addition, and without affecting subsection (3):

      * (a) an assessment of the original company for an income year that ends before the income year that includes the completion time; or

      * (b) an amendment of the assessment;

    * is taken to be something that had happened to the interposed company, whether or not the assessment or amendment is made before the completion time.

    * (6) This section has effect for the purposes of applying this Part to *members of the *consolidated group in relation to an *instalment quarter of the interposed company that ends after the completion time.

          * Note: An assessment mentioned in subsection (5) may therefore be taken to be the base assessment of the interposed company for the purposes of this Part.

    * (7) Subsections (1) to (6) are to be disregarded in applying section 45705 (about the application of this Subdivision to a company as the *head company of a *consolidated group).

          * Note: For example, if the Commissioner has given an initial head company instalment rate to the original company during an earlier instalment quarter, the rate is not, despite this section, treated as if it had been given to the interposed company for the purposes of section 45705. Subject to the other provisions in that section, this Subdivision therefore starts applying to the interposed company under subsection 45705(4).

    * Special rule for the original company

    * (8) A provision of this Part that applies on an entity becoming a *subsidiary member of a *consolidated group does not apply to the original company when it is taken to have become such a member at the completion time as a result of section 70370 of the _Income Tax Assessment Act 1997_.

          * Note: Section 45755 (the entry rule) therefore does not apply to the original company on the company becoming a subsidiary member of the consolidated group.

##### 45755  Entry rule (for an entity that becomes a subsidiary member of a consolidated group)

    * (1) Despite any other provisions in this Part, an entity is liable to pay an instalment for an *instalment quarter or income year (as appropriate) during which the entity becomes a *subsidiary member of a *consolidated group if:

      * (a) this Subdivision applies to the *head company of the group at any time during that quarter or year (as appropriate); and

      * (b) the entity would otherwise be liable to pay an instalment for that quarter or year (as appropriate) if it had not become a subsidiary member of the group; and

      * (c) the entity becomes a subsidiary member of the group on a day other than the first day of that quarter or the first day of that year (as appropriate).

          * Note: Under paragraph (b), this section could apply to an entity that, at the time of becoming a subsidiary member of the group, was not a subsidiary member of another consolidated group, or was a member of another consolidated group but this Subdivision did not apply to the head company of that other group at that time.

    * Modifications for a quarterly payer who pays 4 instalments annually on the basis of GDPadjusted notional tax

    * (2) Subsections (3) and (4) apply to the entity if:

      * (a) the entity would have been a *quarterly payer who pays 4 instalments annually on the basis of GDPadjusted notional tax at the end of the *instalment quarter mentioned in subsection (1) if it had not become a *subsidiary member of the group; and

      * (b) the amount of the instalment payable by the entity for that quarter would have been worked out under paragraph 45112(1)(b); and

      * (c) that quarter is not the fourth instalment quarter in an income year.

    * (3) For the purposes of working out the amount of the instalment payable by the entity for that *instalment quarter, subsection 45410(5) applies to the entity as if that quarter were the fourth instalment quarter in the income year for which the entity is liable to pay an instalment.

    * (4) For the purposes of working out the *acceptable amount of the entity's instalment for that instalment quarter, subsection 45232(3) applies to the entity as if that quarter were the fourth instalment quarter in the income year for which the entity is liable to pay an instalment.

##### 45760  Exit rule (for an entity that ceases to be a subsidiary member of a consolidated group)

      * (c) the entity does not, at the time it ceases to be a subsidiary member of the group, become:

        * (i) a subsidiary member of another consolidated group the head company of which is one to which this Subdivision applies at that time; or

        * (ii) a member (other than the *provisional head company) of a *MEC group the provisional head company of which is one to which this Subdivision applies, in accordance with Subdivision 45S, at that time;

      * (d) this Part applies to the entity under section 4510.

    * (2) This Part applies to the entity as if:

      * (a) the Commissioner had given the entity an instalment rate equal to the most recent instalment rate given to the *head company mentioned in paragraph (1)(a) before the end of the *instalment quarter mentioned in that paragraph; and

      * (b) the entity were a *quarterly payer who pays on the basis of instalment income at the end of that instalment quarter, and of each subsequent instalment quarter, until:

        * (ii) if that rate is given to the entity during any other instalment quarter of an income year--immediately after the end of the last instalment quarter of that year.

    * (3) This section only covers the first *base assessment of the entity for an income year that is, or includes, a period after the entity ceases to be a *subsidiary member of the group.

##### 45775  Commissioner's power to work out different instalment rate or GDPadjusted notional tax

    * (1) This section applies if any of the following changes (the**_ membership change_**) occurs in relation to a *consolidated group while this Subdivision applies to the *head company of the group:

      * (a) an entity becomes a *subsidiary member of the group or a number of entities become subsidiary members of the group;

      * (b) an entity ceases to be a subsidiary member of the group or a number of entities cease to be subsidiary members of the group.

    * (2) If the Commissioner, having regard to the object of this Part and the membership change, is of the opinion that it would be reasonable to do so, the Commissioner may work out:

      * (a) an instalment rate that is higher, or lower, than the most recent instalment rate given by the Commissioner to the *head company under section 4515; or

      * (b) an amount of *GDPadjusted notional tax that is higher, or lower, than the amount of GDPadjusted notional tax worked out for the purposes of the most recent amount of instalment notified by the Commissioner to the head company under paragraph 45112(1)(a).

    * (3) The new instalment rate or amount of *GDPadjusted notional tax must be a rate or amount that, in the opinion of the Commissioner, is reasonable having regard to the object of this Part and the membership change.

          * Note 1: Subdivision 45J does not apply for the purpose of working out an instalment rate under this section.

          * Note 2: Section 45405 does not apply for the purpose of working out an amount of GDPadjusted notional tax under this section.

    * Additional applications of subsection (2)

    * (4) If, after exercising the power in relation to the membership change under subsection (2) for the first time, and on the basis of an assessment (including an amendment) of the *head company for the income year in which the change occurs, or for an earlier year, the Commissioner has worked out:

      * (a) another instalment rate under section 45320 for the company (whether or not the Commissioner has given that rate to the company); or

      * (b) another amount of *GDPadjusted notional tax under section 45405 for the company (whether or not the Commissioner has notified the company an amount of instalment based on that other amount);

    * the Commissioner may again exercise the power under subsection (2) in relation to the membership change, as if:

      * (c) the rate mentioned in paragraph (a) were the most recent instalment rate mentioned in paragraph (2)(a); and

      * (d) the amount of GDPadjusted notional tax mentioned in paragraph (b) were the amount of GDPadjusted notional tax worked out for the purposes of the most recent amount of instalment that is mentioned in paragraph (2)(b).

    * (5) To avoid doubt, in relation to the membership change, the Commissioner:

      * (a) may exercise the power under subsection (2) by applying subsection (4) more than once; but

      * (b) must not exercise that power more than once in relation to a particular instalment rate mentioned in paragraph (4)(a) or a particular amount of *GDPadjusted notional tax mentioned in paragraph (4)(b).

##### Guide to Subdivision 45R

##### 45850  What this Subdivision is about

    * This Subdivision deals with the application of this Part to members of a consolidated group after the group has come into existence but before the members are treated as a single entity for the purposes of this Part.

    * This Subdivision also contains special rules in relation to the application of Subdivision 45Q to members of a consolidated group in these circumstances: 

          * (a) a group whose members were treated as a single entity under that Subdivision (a **_mature group_**) is acquired by another group (see section 45880); or

          * (b) a member of a mature group ceases to be such a member and becomes the head company of a new group (see section 45885).

          * Note: Subdivision 45S extends the operation of this Subdivision so that it can apply to members of a MEC group. It contains modifications of this Subdivision for the purposes of that extended operation.

    * Different instalment period--instalment quarter

    * (1) If:

      * (a) but for Subdivision 45Q, a *subsidiary member of a *consolidated group would be liable to pay an instalment for an *instalment quarter of the subsidiary member that includes the starting time; and

      * (b) that quarter starts before the start of the instalment quarter of the *head company of the group that includes the starting time;

    * then, despite section 45710, the subsidiary member is liable to pay an instalment for that quarter.

    * Different instalment period--income year

    * (2) If:

      * (a) but for Subdivision 45Q, a *subsidiary member of a *consolidated group would be liable to pay an annual instalment for an income year of the subsidiary member that includes the starting time; and

    * (3) The amount of the instalment must be worked out on the following assumptions:

      * (a) that the *instalment quarter or income year of the *subsidiary member (as appropriate) consists only of the period that is the part of the quarter or year occurring before the starting time;

      * (b) that an amount required to be worked out for the purpose of determining the *instalment income of the subsidiary member for that period is worked out under section 45855.

    * (4) For the purposes of this section, the **_starting time_** is the time at which Subdivision 45Q starts to apply to the *head company of the group because of subsection 45705(2) or subparagraph 45705(3)(c)(ii), (4)(d)(ii) or (iv).

##### 45865  Credit rule

    * (1) When the Commissioner makes an assessment:

      * (a) of the income tax that the *head company of a *consolidated group is liable to pay for a *consolidation transitional year for the head company; or

      * (b) that no income tax is payable by the head company for that year;

    * the head company is, in addition to any credit to which it is entitled under section 4530 for that year, entitled to a credit in relation to instalments payable by an entity that is a *subsidiary member of the group at any time during that year.

    * (2) The credit is equal to:

      * (a) the sum of so much of each instalment payable by the entity (even if it has not paid it) for an *instalment quarter of a *consolidation transitional year for the entity, or for that year, as is reasonably attributable to so much of that quarter or year:

        * (i) which is, or is included in, the consolidation transitional year for the *head company; and

        * (ii) during which the entity is a *subsidiary member of the group;

      * minus

      * (b) the sum of so much of each credit that the entity has claimed under section 45215 or 45420 for each instalment quarter covered by paragraph (a) as is reasonably attributable to:

        * (i) for a credit under section 45215--so much of the preceding instalment quarters of that consolidation transitional year for the entity which is covered by subparagraphs (a)(i) and (ii); or

        * (ii) for a credit under section 45420--so much of that instalment quarter and the preceding instalment quarters of that consolidation transitional year for the entity which is covered by subparagraphs (a)(i) and (ii).

    * (3) To avoid doubt, if:

      * (a) during the *instalment quarter or the *consolidation transitional year mentioned in paragraph (2)(a), the entity is a *subsidiary member of:

        * (i) 2 or more *consolidated groups; or

        * (ii) one or more consolidated groups and one or more *MEC groups; and

      * (b) an amount is taken into account under that paragraph or paragraph (2)(b) in working out the credit to which the *head company of one of the groups is entitled under subsection (1);

    * that amount is not to be taken into account in working out the credit to which the head company of another of those groups is entitled under that subsection.

    * (4) A reference in subsection (3) to subsection (1) or paragraph (2)(a) or (b) includes a reference to that provision in its extended operation in relation to a *MEC group under Subdivision 45S.

##### 45870  Head company's liability to GIC on shortfall in quarterly instalment

    * Liability for the general interest charge

    * (1) Subject to subsections (3) and (4), the *head company of a *consolidated group is liable to pay the *general interest charge under this section for an *instalment quarter in a *consolidation transitional year for the head company if:

      * (a) the instalment payable by at least one *member of the group for that quarter is worked out:

        * (i) under paragraph 45112(1)(b) or (c); or

        * (ii) by using an instalment rate under section 45205; and

      * (b) the sum of instalments payable by the members of the group for that quarter, reduced by credits claimed by those members under section 45215 or 45420 for that quarter, is less than 17/80 of the head company's *benchmark tax for that consolidation transitional year.

          * Note: 17/80 of the head company's benchmark tax represents an amount that is 85% of one quarter of that benchmark tax.

    * Amount on which the charge is payable

    * (2) Subject to subsections (3) and (4), the *general interest charge is payable on the amount worked out in accordance with the following method statement (if the amount is a positive amount).

Method statement

        * Step 1.	Work out the amount that is 1/4 of the *benchmark tax of the *head company for that *consolidation transitional year of that head company.

        * Step 2.	Work out the sum of instalments that would have been payable by all the *members of the group for that *instalment quarter of that *head company if none of the members had worked out its instalment for that quarter under paragraph 45112(1)(b) or (c) or by using an instalment rate under section 45205.

        * Step 3.	Work out the sum of instalments payable by all the *members of the group for that *instalment quarter, reduced by credits claimed by the members under section 45215 or 45420 for that quarter.

        * Step 4.	Reduce the lesser of the results of step and 2 by the result of step 3. The result of this step is the amount on which the *general interest charge is payable if it is a positive amount. No general interest charge is payable if the result of this step is nil or a negative amount.

    * Amounts of instalments or credits that are taken into account

    * (3) In working out an amount of instalment or credit for a *subsidiary member of the group for the purposes of any of the following provisions:

      * (a) paragraph (1)(b);

      * (b) step 2 or 3 of the method statement;

    * take into account only an amount of instalment or credit covered by that provision that is reasonably attributable to a period in that *consolidation transitional year of the *head company during which it is a subsidiary member of the group.

    * Members having different instalment quarters

    * (4) In working out an amount of instalment or credit for a *subsidiary member whose *instalment quarters differ from those of the *head company for the purposes of any of the following provisions:

      * (a) paragraph (1)(a) or (b);

      * (b) step 2 or 3 of the method statement;

    * a reference to an instalment quarter in a *consolidation transitional year of the head company in any of those provisions includes a reference to the last instalment quarter of that subsidiary member ending before the end of that instalment quarter of the head company.

    * (5) Subsections (6) and (7) apply if:

      * (a) the *head company of the *consolidated group is a *monthly payer at a time in an *instalment month (the **_current month_**); and

      * (b) any of the other *members of the group (the **_subsidiary quarterly payers_**) are *quarterly payers at a time in the *instalment quarter (the **_current quarter_**) in which the current month starts.

    * (6) Apply the following rules:

      * (a) treat the reference in subsection (1) to an *instalment quarter as being a reference to the current month;

      * (b) treat the references in this section to that quarter (or that instalment quarter) as being references to the current month.

    * (7) Also apply the following rules, for the purposes of subsections (1) to (5):

      * (a) treat the subsidiary quarterly payers as *monthly payers for each *instalment month (a **_notional instalment month_**) that starts (disregarding paragraph (6)(a)) in the current quarter;

      * (b) apply this section separately in relation to each of those notional instalment months;

      * (c) treat the amount of instalment or credit for a subsidiary quarterly payer in respect of a notional instalment month as being the extent to which the amount of instalment or credit for the subsidiary quarterly payer for the current quarter is attributable to that notional instalment month.

##### 45875  Other rules about the general interest charge

    * (1) The *general interest charge under section 45870 for an *instalment quarter in an income year is payable by the *head company for each day in the period that:

      * (a) started at the beginning of the day by which the instalment for that quarter was due to be paid; and

      * (b) finishes at the end of the day on which the head company's assessed tax for that income year is due to be paid.

    * (2) The Commissioner must give the *head company written notice of the *general interest charge. The head company must pay the charge within 14 days after the notice is given to the head company.

    * (3) If any of the *general interest charge remains unpaid at the end of the 14 days, the *head company is also liable to pay the general interest charge on the unpaid amount for each day in the period that:

      * (a) starts at the end of those 14 days; and

      * (b) finishes at the end of the last day on which, at the end of the day, any of the following remains unpaid:

        * (i) the unpaid amount;

        * (ii) general interest charge on the unpaid amount.

    * (4) The Commissioner may, if he or she is satisfied that because special circumstances exist it would be fair and reasonable to do so, remit the whole or any part of any *general interest charge payable under section 45870.

##### 45880  Continued application of Subdivision 45Q to the head company of an acquired group

    * (1) This section applies to a company for which all of the following conditions are satisfied in relation to a particular time (the **_takeover time_**):

      * (a) just before the takeover time, Subdivision 45Q applied to the company as the *head company of a *consolidated group;

      * (b) at the takeover time, the company becomes a *whollyowned subsidiary of a *member of another consolidated group or *MEC group;

      * (c) that other group is consolidated at or before the takeover time under section 70350 or 71950 of the _Income Tax Assessment Act 1997_;

      * (d) the Commissioner receives the choice (or notice) under that section for the consolidation of that other group not later than 28 days after the takeover time, or within such further period (if any) as the Commissioner allows;

      * (e) at the takeover time, Subdivision 45Q (including that Subdivision as applied under Subdivision 45S) does not apply to the head company or the *provisional head company of that other group.

    * (2) For the purposes of this Part only, this Act has effect in relation to the company and the other *members of the *consolidated group mentioned in paragraph (1)(a) (the **_preserved group_**) as if, during the period covered by subsection (5):

      * (a) the preserved group had continued to exist as a consolidated group; and

      * (b) the company were still the *head company of the preserved group; and

      * (c) Subdivision 45Q had continued to apply to the company as the head company of the preserved group; and

      * (d) an entity, while being a *subsidiary member of the preserved group, were not treated as a member of the group mentioned in paragraph (1)(b) (the **_new group_**).

    * (3) Subsection (2) does not stop the company from being a member of the new group for the purposes of this Part during the period covered by subsection (5).

          * Note: This means, for example, sections 45855 and 45860 apply to the head company as a member of the new group.

    * (4) However, for the purposes of applying section 45855 to the company, a reference in that section to an application of section 7011 of the _Income Tax Assessment Act 1997 _to the company in relation to the period mentioned in section 45855 is taken to be:

      * (a) a reference only to an application of section 7011 of that Act to the company as a member of the new group during that period; and

      * (b) not a reference to an application (because of subsection (2) of this section) of section 7011 of that Act to the company as the *head company of the preserved group during that period.

    * (5) This subsection covers the period that starts from the start of the *instalment quarter of the company that includes the takeover time and ends at the earlier of the following times:

      * (a) the end of the instalment quarter of the company during which the company ceases to be a member of the new group;

      * (b) just before the instalment quarter of the company during which the Commissioner gives the *initial head company instalment rate to the *head company, or the *provisional head company, of the new group.

    * (6) The Commissioner may, on the application of the company made not later than 28 days after the takeover time, allow such extension of time for the purposes of paragraph (1)(d) as he or she considers appropriate.

    * (7) To avoid doubt, nothing in this section prevents the operation of section 45755 or 45760 to *members of the preserved group while it continues to exist under subsection (2).

##### 45885  Early application of Subdivision 45Q to the head company of a new group

    * (1) This section applies to a company for which all of the following conditions are satisfied in relation to a particular time (the **_starting time_**):

      * (a) just before the starting time, the company was a *subsidiary member of a *consolidated group, or a member of a *MEC group;

      * (b) just before the starting time, the consolidated group or MEC group was a mature group (see subsection (4));

      * (c) at the starting time, either of the following applies:

        * (i) the company ceases to be a subsidiary member of the consolidated group, or a member of the MEC group;

        * (ii) the group ceases to exist (otherwise than because a MEC group or consolidated group is *created from the group, or because its *head company or *provisional head company becomes a *whollyowned subsidiary of a member of another mature group);

      * (d) at the starting time, the company is the head company of another consolidated group;

      * (e) within 28 days after the starting time, or within such further period (if any) as the Commissioner allows, the Commissioner receives the notice under section 70358 of the _Income Tax Assessment Act 1997_ in relation to the choice to consolidate, at and after the starting time, that other consolidated group under section 70350 of the _Income Tax Assessment Act 1997_.

    * (2) For the purposes of this Part:

      * (a) the instalment rate that the Commissioner is taken to have given to the company under paragraph 45760(2)(a) has effect as if it were the *initial head company instalment rate for the company as the *head company of the *consolidated group mentioned in paragraph (1)(d); and

      * (b) an instalment rate that would otherwise be the initial head company instalment rate for the company as the head company of that consolidated group is not to be treated as that initial head company instalment rate.

          * Note: This means, subject to the provisions in section 45705, Subdivision 45Q starts applying to the company as the head company of the consolidated group at the start of the instalment quarter that includes the starting time: see subsection (2) of that section and paragraph 45760(2)(a).

    * (3) The Commissioner may, on the application of the company made within 28 days after the starting time, allow such extension of time for the purposes of paragraph (1)(e) as he or she considers appropriate.

    * Mature group

    * (4) For the purposes of this section, a *consolidated group or a *MEC group is a **_mature group _**at a particular time if:

      * (a) for a consolidated group--Subdivision 45Q applies to its *head company at that time; or

      * (b) for a MEC group--Subdivision 45Q, as applied under Subdivision 45S, applies to its *provisional head company at that time.

        * (ii) just before the instalment quarter of the company determined under paragraph (6)(c).

          * Note: The application of Subdivision 45Q to the provisional head company is subject to the modifications set out in this section and elsewhere in this Subdivision.

    * When the period begins--initial head company instalment rate

    * (2) Subdivision 45Q starts to apply to a company as the *provisional head company of a *MEC group at the start of an *instalment quarter under this subsection if, during that quarter, the Commissioner gives the company (as that provisional head company) the *initial head company instalment rate.

          * Note: The operation of this subsection may be affected by section 45885 (as applied under this Subdivision).

    * When the period begins--group created from consolidated group

    * (3) Subdivision 45Q starts to apply to a company as the *provisional head company of a *MEC group at the start of an *instalment quarter (the **_starting quarter_**) under this subsection if all of the following conditions are satisfied:

      * (a) during the starting quarter, the Commissioner is notified of the creation of the MEC group from a *consolidated group (see subsection (5));

      * (b) the company is the provisional head company of the MEC group when the Commissioner is so notified;

      * (c) either of the following applies:

        * (i) Subdivision 45Q applied to the *head company of the consolidated group at the end of the previous instalment quarter;

        * (ii) the Commissioner gives the *initial head company instalment rate to the head company of the consolidated group during the starting quarter.

          * Note: For the application of Subdivision 45Q to a head company of a consolidated group: see section 45705.

    * When the period begins--new provisional head company

    * (4) Subdivision 45Q starts to apply to a company as the *provisional head company of a *MEC group at the start of an *instalment quarter (the **_starting quarter_**) under this subsection if both of the following conditions are satisfied:

      * (a) the company is appointed as the provisional head company of the MEC group under subsection 71960(3) of the _Income Tax Assessment Act 1997_ during the starting quarter;

      * (b) one of the following applies:

        * (i) Subdivision 45Q applied to the former provisional head company of the MEC group at the end of the previous instalment quarter;

        * (ii) the Commissioner gives the *initial head company instalment rate to the former provisional head company of the MEC group during the starting quarter;

        * (iii) the Commissioner is notified during the starting quarter of the creation of the MEC group from a *consolidated group and Subdivision 45Q applied to the *head company of the consolidated group at the end of the previous instalment quarter;

        * (iv) the Commissioner is notified during the starting quarter of the creation of the MEC group from a consolidated group and the Commissioner gives the initial head company instalment rate to the head company of the consolidated group during the starting quarter.

    * When the period begins--modified timing for provisional head company that is monthly payer

    * (4A) Subsection (4B) applies if:

      * (a) apart from subsection (4B), Subdivision 45Q starts to apply to a company as the *provisional head company of a *MEC group at a particular time because of the operation of subsection (2), (3) or (4); and

      * (b) the company is a *monthly payer; and

      * (c) the Commissioner gave the *initial head company instalment rate as mentioned in subsection (2), subparagraph (3)(c)(ii), subparagraph (4)(b)(ii) or subparagraph (4)(b)(iv) in an *instalment month.

    * (4B) Treat subsection (2), (3) or (4) (as the case requires) as providing that Subdivision 45Q starts to apply to the company as the *provisional head company of the *MEC group at the start of the _next _*instalment month.

          * Note: For the application of this Subdivision to a monthly payer, see sections 45703 and 45910.

    * Notification of creation of MEC group from consolidated group

    * (5) For the purposes of subsections (3) and (4), the Commissioner is notified of the creation of a *MEC group from a *consolidated group when the Commissioner receives a notice of the consolidation of the MEC group under subsection 71940(1) of the _Income Tax Assessment Act 1997_.

    * When the period ends

    * (6) Subdivision 45Q stops applying to a company as the *provisional head company of a *MEC group at the earliest of the following times after the company becomes the provisional head company:

      * (a) the end of the *instalment quarter during which the MEC group ceases to exist (other than because a *consolidated group is *created from the MEC group);

      * (b) the end of the instalment quarter during which a consolidated group is created from the MEC group;

      * (c) just before the instalment quarter during which another company is appointed as the provisional head company of the MEC group under subsection 71960(3) of the _Income Tax Assessment Act 1997_.

          * Note: The operation of this subsection because of paragraph (a) may be affected by section 45880 (as applied under this Subdivision).

    * (7) To avoid doubt, Subdivision 45Q does not apply to a company as the *provisional head company of a *MEC group for any time at all if:

      * (a) subsection (2), (3) or (4), and subsection (6), would, apart from this subsection, apply to the company; but

      * (b) the time at which Subdivision 45Q would stop applying to the company under subsection (6) is before the time at which that Subdivision would start to apply to the company under subsection (2), (3) or (4).

    * (8) To avoid doubt, Subdivision 45Q may apply to a company as the *provisional head company of a *MEC group at a time when the company is not in fact the provisional head company of the group.

          * Note: An example of this is when a company replaces another company as the provisional head company of a MEC group. Under this section and section 45920, Subdivision 45Q may start applying to the company as if it had already become the provisional head company when it is not yet such a company.

##### 45917  Assumption for applying section 45710 (single entity rule)

    * In applying section 45710 to members of a *MEC group at a particular time, the company that is the *provisional head company of the group at that time must be assumed to be the *head company of the group at all times during the period:

      * (a) throughout which the group is in existence; and

      * (b) that is all or a part of the income year of the company that includes that particular time.

##### 45920  Change of provisional head company

    * Object

    * (1) The object of this section (except subsection (9)) is to ensure that, for the purposes of this Part, when a company becomes the new *provisional head company of a *MEC group:

      * (a) the company inherits the history of the former provisional head company; and

      * (b) the history of the new provisional head company is effectively ignored.

    * (2) This section applies to a *provisional head company of a *MEC group (the **_new provisional head company_**) that is appointed under subsection 71960(3) of the _Income Tax Assessment Act 1997_ if one of the following conditions is satisfied:

      * (a) the conditions in subsection 45915(4) are satisfied in relation to the new provisional head company (whether or not Subdivision 45Q applies to the company as the provisional head company of the group for any period of time);

      * (b) the new provisional head company is so appointed during the *instalment quarter of the company in which the MEC group is *created from a *consolidated group and either:

        * (i) the Commissioner gives the *initial head company instalment rate to the *head company of the consolidated group during that instalment quarter; or

        * (ii) Subdivision 45Q applied to the head company of the consolidated group at the end of the previous instalment quarter.

    * (3) Everything that happened before the starting time in relation to the company (the **_former company_**) that was the *provisional head company of the *MEC group immediately before the starting time:

      * (a) is taken to have happened in relation to the new provisional head company instead of in relation to the former company; and

      * (b) is taken to have happened in relation to the new provisional head company instead of what would (apart from this section) be taken to have happened in relation to the new provisional head company before the starting time;

    * just as if, at all times before the starting time:

      * (c) the new provisional head company had been the former company; and

      * (d) the former company had been the new provisional head company.

    * (4) For the purposes of this section, the **_starting time_** is the time at which the *cessation event happened to the former company (the event that results in the appointment of the new provisional head company).

    * (5) To avoid doubt, subsection (3) also covers everything that, immediately before the starting time, was taken to have happened in relation to the former company because of:

      * (a) section 7011 of the _Income Tax Assessment Act 1997 _(single entity rule); or

      * (b) section 7015 of that Act (entry history rule); or

      * (c) section 70375 of that Act (effects of an interposed company becoming the *head company of a *consolidated group); or

      * (d) section 71990 of that Act (effects of a change of head company of a *MEC group); or

      * (e) section 45710 in this Schedule (single entity rule for the purposes of this Part), including an application of that section under this Subdivision; or

      * (f) section 45740 in this Schedule (effects of an interposed company becoming the head company of a consolidated group for the purposes of this Part); or

      * (g) this section; or

      * (h) one or more previous applications of any of the provisions covered by paragraphs (a) to (g).

    * (6) In addition, and without affecting subsection (3):

      * (a) an assessment of the former company for an income year that ends before the income year that includes the starting time; or

      * (b) an amendment of the assessment;

    * is taken to be something that had happened to the new provisional head company, whether or not the assessment or amendment is made before the starting time.

    * (7) This section has effect for the purposes of applying this Part to members of the *MEC group in relation to an *instalment quarter of the new provisional head company that ends after the starting time.

          * Note: An assessment mentioned in subsection (6) may therefore be taken to be the base assessment of the new provisional head company for the purposes of this Part.

    * (8) Subsections (1) to (7) are to be disregarded in applying section 45915 (about the application of Subdivision 45Q to a company as the *provisional head company of a *MEC group).

          * Note: For example, if the Commissioner has given an initial head company instalment rate to the former company during an earlier instalment quarter, the rate is not, despite this section, treated as if it had been given to the new provisional head company for the purposes of section 45915. Subject to the other provisions in that section, Subdivision 45Q therefore starts applying to the new provisional head company under subsection 45915(4).

    * Special rule for the former company

    * (9) A provision of this Part that applies on an entity becoming a member (other than the *provisional head company) of a *MEC group does not apply to the former company when it becomes such a member at the starting time.

          * Note: Section 45755 (the entry rule, as applied under this Subdivision) therefore does not apply to the former company on the company becoming such a member of the MEC group.

##### 45922  Life insurance company

    * In applying Subdivision 45Q to members of a *MEC group for an *instalment quarter of the *provisional head company of the group in an income year of the provisional head company, the company is taken to be a *life insurance company for that quarter if:

      * (a) one or more life insurance companies are members of the group at any time during that quarter; or

      * (b) one or more life insurance companies were members of the group at any time during a previous instalment quarter of the company in that year.

##### Extended operation of Subdivision 45R

##### 45925  Additional modifications of sections 45855 and 45860

    * In applying sections 45855 and 45860 to members of a *MEC group, those sections have effect as if, in addition to the modifications set out in the table in section 45910:

      * (a) a reference in those sections to subsection 45705(2) were a reference to subsection 45915(2); and

      * (b) a reference in those sections to subparagraph 45705(3)(c)(ii), (4)(d)(ii) or (iv) were a reference to subparagraph 45915(3)(c)(ii), (4)(b)(ii) or (iv).

##### 45930  Modifications of sections 45865 and 45870 and a related provision

    * (1) In applying sections 45865 and 45870, and subsection 4530(4) (which is related to section 45865), to members of a *MEC group, those provisions have effect as if:

      * (a) a reference in those provisions to a *consolidated group were a reference to a *MEC group; and

      * (b) a reference in those provisions to a MEC group were a reference to a consolidated group.

          * Note: This means a reference in those provisions to the head company of a consolidated group has effect as if it were a reference to the head company of a MEC group. Similarly, a reference in those provisions to a subsidiary member of a consolidated group has effect as if it were a reference to a subsidiary member of a MEC group.

    * (2) However, the modifications in subsection (1) do not apply to subsection 45865(4) and the note at the end of section 45865.

          * Note: This means subsection 45865(4) and the note apply to members of a MEC group without any modifications.

##### 45935  Additional modifications of section 45885

    * In applying section 45885 to members of a *MEC group, that section has effect as if, in addition to the modifications set out in the table in section 45910, it had been modified as set out in the following table:

##### 951  What this Division is about

    * You are liable to pay a charge on the income tax you pay on excess concessional contributions.

    * The charge is applied at a uniform rate that is the same as the shortfall interest charge.

    * The period for the excess concessional contributions charge starts at the start of the income year and ends just before tax is due to be paid under your first assessment for the year.

##### Subdivision 95A--Object of Division

##### 955  Object of Division

    * The object of this Division is to neutralise benefits that taxpayers could otherwise receive from *excess concessional contributions, so that they do not receive an advantage in the form of:

      * (a) the later time at which *tax is collected, as compared to tax that is collected through the Pay as you go system; and

      * (b) the earnings on the contributions, which receive a concessional tax rate and remain in superannuation even if the contributions are released under Division 96.

       * 9525	General interest charge

##### 9510  Liability to excess concessional contributions charge

    * (1) If:

      * (a) you have *excess concessional contributions for a *financial year; and

      * (b) you are liable to pay an amount of *tax (your **_actual tax_**) for the corresponding income year; and

      * (c) your actual tax exceeds the amount of tax you would be liable to pay for the income year if the excess concessional contributions were disregarded;

    * the excess is an amount of tax on which you are liable to pay **_excess concessional contributions charge_**.

          * Note 1: Excess concessional contributions are included in assessable income and give rise to a tax offset: see section 29115 of the _Income Tax Assessment Act 1997_.

          * Note 2: In this Act, **_tax_** is an assessed amount: see subsection 9951(1) of the _Income Tax Assessment Act 1997_.

    * (2) If you would not be liable to pay *tax for the income year if the *excess concessional contributions were disregarded, apply paragraph (1)(c) as if you would be liable to pay a nil amount of tax.

    * Period for which the charge is payable

    * (3) The liability is for each day in the period:

      * (a) beginning on the first day of the income year; and

      * (b) ending on the day before the day on which *tax under your first notice of assessment for that income year is due to be paid, or would be due to be paid if there were any.

##### 9515  Amount of excess concessional contributions charge

    * The *excess concessional contributions charge for a day is worked out by multiplying the rate worked out under section 4 of the _Superannuation (Excess Concessional Contributions Charge) Act 2013_ for that day by the sum of the following amounts:

      * (a) the amount of *tax on which you are liable to pay the charge;

      * (b) the excess concessional contributions charge on that amount from previous days.

##### 9520  When excess concessional contributions charge is due and payable

    * (1) The *excess concessional contributions charge you are liable to pay for an income year is due and payable on the day on which *tax is due to be paid under your first notice of assessment for that income year that includes an amount of tax on which you are liable to pay the charge.

          * Note: For when income tax is due and payable, see section 55 of the _Income Tax Assessment Act 1997_.

    * Determination required

    * (2) An amount of *excess concessional contributions charge is only due and payable if the Commissioner gives you an *excess concessional contributions determination stating the amount of the charge (although it may be taken by subsection (1) to have been due and payable at a time before the determination was made).

          * Note: For excess concessional contributions determinations, see Division 97.

    * Amended determinations

    * (3) However, if the Commissioner amends your *excess concessional contributions determination, any extra charge resulting from the amendment is due and payable 21 days after the Commissioner gives you notice of the amended determination.

##### 9525  General interest charge

    * If an amount of *excess concessional contributions charge or *shortfall interest charge on excess concessional contributions charge that you are liable to pay remains unpaid after the time by which it is due to be paid, you are liable to pay the *general interest charge on the unpaid amount for each day in the period that:

      * (a) begins on the day on which the amount was due to be paid; and

      * (b) ends on the last day on which, at the end of the day, any of the following remains unpaid:

        * (i) the excess concessional contributions charge or shortfall interest charge;

        * (ii) the general interest charge on any of the excess concessional contributions charge or shortfall interest charge.

          * Note 1: The general interest charge is worked out under Part IIA.

          * Note 2: Shortfall interest charge is worked out under Division 280 in this Schedule.

          * Note 3: See section 510 of the _Income Tax Assessment Act 1997_ for when the amount of shortfall interest charge becomes due and payable.

##### Requesting a release authority

##### 965  Electing to release excess concessional contributions

    * Original determinations

    * (1) If you receive an *excess concessional contributions determination for a *financial year, you may elect to release from a *superannuation interest an amount not exceeding 85% of the *excess concessional contributions stated in the determination.

          * Note 1: For excess concessional contributions determinations, see Subdivision 97A.

          * Note 2: Released excess concessional contributions are not included in your nonconcessional contributions (a grossup also applies): see subsection 29290(1A) of the _Income Tax Assessment Act 1997_.

    * Amended determinations

    * (2) However, if the *excess concessional contributions determination is an amended determination increasing the stated amount of your *excess concessional contributions, you may elect to release an amount not exceeding:

      * (a) 85% of the excess concessional contributions stated in the amended determination; less

      * (b) any amount you elect to release under subsection (1) in relation to an earlier determination.

    * Requirements for election

    * (3) You make the election by:

      * (a) notifying the Commissioner of the amount you elect to release; and

      * (b) identifying the *superannuation interest or interests you have from which the amount is to be released; and

      * (c) if you identify more than one superannuation interest--stating the amount to be released from each such interest.

    * (4) The election must:

      * (a) be in the *approved form; and

      * (b) be given to the Commissioner within:

        * (i) 21 days after receiving notice of the *excess concessional contributions determination or amended excess concessional contributions determination; or

        * (ii) a further period allowed by the Commissioner.

    * Unsuccessful elections--making a further election

    * (5) If:

          * Note 1: For excess nonconcessional contributions determinations, see Subdivision 97B.

          * Note 2: The released amount will be nonassessable nonexempt income (see section 30317 of the _Income Tax Assessment Act 1997_), but an amount corresponding to your associated earnings on those excess contributions will be included in your assessable income (see Subdivision 292B of that Act).

          * Note 3: If the value of your superannuation interests is between nil and that total release amount, you could first make an election under paragraph (a) and then a further election under paragraph (b) (see subsection (6)).

      * (a) one or more superannuation providers who hold one or more *superannuation interests for you; and

    * you may make a further election under paragraph (1)(a) or (b) for the release, or nonrelease, of the unpaid amount.

          * Note: That further election would be under paragraph (1)(b) if the value of your superannuation interests is now nil.

    * (7) The further election must comply with subsection (4) and paragraph (5)(a), and must be given to the Commissioner within:

      * (a) 60 days after the Commissioner issued the notice mentioned in paragraph (6)(b); or

##### Operative provisions

##### 13310  Determination of tax that is deferred to a debt account

    * (1) The Commissioner must make a determination specifying the amount the Commissioner has ascertained as being the extent to which your *assessed Division 293 tax for an income year is *defined benefit tax attributable to a *superannuation interest.

          * Note 1: For variation and revocation, see subsection 33(3) of the _Acts Interpretation Act 1901_.

          * Note 2: For general provisions, including review, see section 13330.

    * (2) The amount of *assessed Division 293 tax specified in the determination is **_deferred to a debt account_** for the *superannuation interest.

    * (3) However, the Commissioner must not make a determination under this section in relation to a *superannuation interest if, at the time the determination is to be made:

      * (a) the *end benefit for the superannuation interest has become payable; or

      * (b) a notice under section 133125 has been made in relation to the superannuation interest.

          * Note: For the meaning of **_end benefit_**, see section 133130.

    * (4) Subsection (1) does not apply if the Commissioner ascertains that no part of your *assessed Division 293 tax for an income year is *defined benefit tax attributable to a *superannuation interest.

##### 13315  Defined benefit tax

    * (1) Your **_defined benefit tax_** for an income year is the amount worked out using the formula:

    * where: 

    * **_defined benefit contribution component_** means the amount worked out as follows:

      * (a) work out the lesser of the following for the corresponding *financial year:

        * (i) your *low tax contributions;

        * (ii) the total amount of your *defined benefit contributions in respect of all *defined benefit interests you have in the financial year;

      * (b) subtract from the result of paragraph (a) the difference (if any) between:

        * (i) your *taxable contributions for the income year; and

        * (ii) your low tax contributions for the corresponding financial year.

           * Note: A difference may exist for paragraph (b) because of the $300,000 high income threshold: see subsection 29320(1) of the _Income Tax Assessment Act 1997_.

    * Exception--defined benefit contribution component is nil or less

    * (2) However, if the defined benefit contribution component mentioned in subsection (1) is nil, or a negative amount, no part of the *Division 293 tax for the income year is **_defined benefit tax_**.

##### 13320  How to attribute the defined benefit tax to defined benefit interests

    * (1) If you have one *defined benefit interest in a *financial year, your *defined benefit tax for the corresponding income year is attributable to that interest.

    * (2) If you have more than one *defined benefit interest in a *financial year, your *defined benefit tax for the corresponding income year is attributable to each such interest in proportion to the *defined benefit contributions for the interest for the financial year.

##### 13325  Determination reducing tax deferred to a debt account

    * (1) If an amount of *assessed Division 293 tax that is *deferred to a debt account for a *superannuation interest is reduced as a result of an amended assessment, the Commissioner must make a determination under this section in respect of the reduced amount.

    * (2) The amount so determined is a **_deferral reversal_** for the *superannuation interest.

          * Note: For variation and revocation, see subsection 33(3) of the _Acts Interpretation Act 1901_.

##### 13330  General provisions applying to determinations under this Subdivision

    * (1) The Commissioner must:

      * (a) make a determination as soon as practicable after:

        * (i) for a determination under section 13310--assessing the amount (whether by way of a first assessment or an amended assessment); or

    * (2) The Commissioner:

      * (a) may include 2 or more determinations under this Subdivision in the same notice; and

      * (b) may include a notice under this Subdivision in a notice of an assessment under this Act.

    * (3) The validity of the determination is not affected because any of the provisions of this Act have not been complied with.

    * Review

    * (4) If you are dissatisfied with a determination made under this Subdivision in relation to you, you may object against the determination in the manner set out in Part IVC.

    * (5) If you are dissatisfied with a decision the Commissioner makes not to make a determination under this Subdivision:

      * (a) you may object against the decision in the manner set out in Part IVC; and

      * (b) for the purpose of working out the period within which the objection must be lodged, notice of the decision is taken to have been served on you on the day notice is given to you of:

    * Accounts to be kept

    * (1) The Commissioner is to keep a debt account for *Division 293 tax for you for a *superannuation interest, if an amount of your *assessed Division 293 tax is *deferred to a debt account for the superannuation interest.

    * Account to be debited for Division 293 tax

    * (2) The Commissioner must debit the debt account for the amount of *assessed Division 293 tax that is *deferred to a debt account for the *superannuation interest.

##### 13365  Interest on debt account balance

    * Interest to be debited at end of financial year

    * (1) If a debt account for a *superannuation interest is in debit at the end of a *financial year, the Commissioner is to debit the account for interest on the amount by which the account is in debit, calculated at the *long term bond rate for that financial year.

          * Note: Interest would not be debited to a debt account that is no longer being kept by the Commissioner because the assessed Division 293 tax liability being tracked in the account has been finally discharged as mentioned in subsection 133105(3).

    * Remission of interest--deferral reversal

    * (2) The Commissioner may remit the whole or any part of an amount of interest debited, or to be debited, from a debt account under subsection (1) if:

      * (a) the debt account is credited:

        * (i) under section 13370 because of a *deferral reversal; or

        * (ii) because a determination under section 13310 is varied or revoked; and

    * Remission of interest--special circumstances

    * (3) The Commissioner may remit the whole or any part of an amount of interest debited, or to be debited, to a debt account under subsection (1) if the Commissioner is satisfied that, because special circumstances exist, it would be fair and reasonable to do so.

    * This Part deals with the methods by which the Commissioner may collect and recover amounts of taxes and other liabilities.

    * These rules may affect you if you are liable to pay an amount of a taxrelated liability (see, for example, Division 255). Some of the rules may also affect you because of your relationship with someone else who is liable for such an amount (see Division 260).

##### Table of sections

       * 2505	Some important concepts about taxrelated liabilities

       * 25010	Summary of taxrelated liabilities

##### 2505  Some important concepts about taxrelated liabilities

    * (1) A taxrelated liability may arise for an entity before it becomes due and payable by that entity.

          * Example: Under Part 25, an entity's liability to pay a withheld amount may arise before the amount is due and payable.

    * (2) For some taxrelated liabilities, an assessment needs to be made before the amount of the relevant liability becomes due and payable.

          * Example: Under Division 5 of the _Income Tax Assessment Act 1997_, an amount of income tax needs to be assessed before it becomes due and payable.

    * (3) An amount of a taxrelated liability may become payable by an entity (for example, when the amount has been assessed) before it is due and payable by that entity.

##### 25010  Summary of taxrelated liabilities

    * (1) The following table is an index of each taxrelated liability under the _Income Tax Assessment Act 1936_. The key provision for the liability, as set out in the table, specifies when the liability becomes due and payable.

          * Note 1: The Commissioner may vary the time at which the amount becomes due and payable. See Subdivision 255B.

          * Note 2: Members and former members of consolidated groups and MEC groups may be jointly and severally liable to pay certain taxrelated liabilities related to the group's activities (see Division 721 of the _Income Tax Assessment Act 1997_).

    * (2) The following table is an index of each taxrelated liability under other Acts. The key provision for the liability, as set out in the table, specifies when the liability becomes due and payable.

          * Note 1: The Commissioner may vary the time at which the amount becomes due and payable. See Subdivision 255B.

          * Note 2: Members and former members of consolidated groups and MEC groups may be jointly and severally liable to pay certain taxrelated liabilities related to the group's activities (see Division 721 of the _Income Tax Assessment Act 1997_).

          * Note 3: Companies that are or were members of the same whollyowned group as an NZ franking company may be jointly and severally liable to pay certain taxrelated liabilities of the NZ franking company (see Division 220 of the _Income Tax Assessment Act 1997_).

          * Note 4: Penalties under Division 175 of the _Australian Charities and Notforprofits Commission Act 2012_, and related general interest charge, are treated in the same way as taxrelated liabilities: see subsection 17570(2) of that Act.

##### Subdivision 250B--Object of this Part

       * _2555	Recovering a taxrelated liability that is due and payable

##### 2551  Meaning of taxrelated liability

    * (1) A **_taxrelated liability_** is a pecuniary liability to the Commonwealth arising directly under a *taxation law (including a liability the amount of which is not yet due and payable).

          * Note 1: See section 25010 for an index of taxrelated liabilities.

          * Note 2: A taxation law, or a provision of it, may be excluded from being applied to this Part. See section 26565.

    * (2) A civil penalty under Division 290 of this Schedule or Part 5 of the _Tax Agent Services Act 2009 _is not a **_taxrelated liability_**.

##### 2555  Recovering a taxrelated liability that is due and payable

    * (1) An amount of a *taxrelated liability that is due and payable:

      * (a) is a debt due to the Commonwealth; and

      * (b) is payable to the Commissioner.

    * (2) The Commissioner, a *Second Commissioner or a *Deputy Commissioner may sue in his or her official name in a court of competent jurisdiction to recover an amount of a *taxrelated liability that remains unpaid after it has become due and payable.

          * Note: The tables in section 25010 set out each provision that specifies when an amount of a taxrelated liability becomes due and payable. The Commissioner may vary that time under Subdivision 255B.

##### Subdivision 255B--Commissioner's power to vary payment time

##### Table of sections

       * 25510	To defer the payment time

       * 25515	To permit payments by instalments

       * 25520	To bring forward the payment time in certain cases

##### 25510  To defer the payment time

    * Deferrals for particular taxpayers

    * (1) The Commissioner may, having regard to the circumstances of your particular case, defer the time at which an amount of a *taxrelated liability is, or would become, due and payable by you (whether or not the liability has already arisen). If the Commissioner does so, that time is varied accordingly.

          * Note: General interest charge or any other relevant penalty, if applicable for any unpaid amount of the liability, will begin to accrue from the time as varied. See, for example, paragraph 515(a) of the _Income Tax Assessment Act 1997_.

    * (2) The Commissioner must do so by written notice given to you.

    * Deferrals for classes of taxpayers

    * (2A) The Commissioner, having regard to the circumstances of the case, may, by notice published on the Australian Taxation Office website, defer the time at which amounts of *taxrelated liabilities are, or would become, due and payable by a class of taxpayers (whether or not the liabilities have already arisen).

    * (2B) If the Commissioner does so, that time is varied accordingly.

          * Note: General interest charge and any other relevant penalties, if applicable for any unpaid amounts of the liabilities, will begin to accrue from the time as varied. See, for example, paragraph 515(a) of the _Income Tax Assessment Act 1997_.

    * (2C) A notice published under subsection (2A) is not a legislative instrument.

    * Deferral does not affect time for giving form

    * (3) A deferral under this section does not defer the time for giving an *approved form to the Commissioner.

          * Note: Section 38855 allows the Commissioner to defer the time for giving an approved form.

##### 25515  To permit payments by instalments

    * (1) The Commissioner may, having regard to the circumstances of your particular case, permit you to pay an amount of a *taxrelated liability by instalments under an *arrangement between you and the Commissioner (whether or not the liability has already arisen).

    * (2) The *arrangement does not vary the time at which the amount is due and payable.

          * Note: Despite an arrangement under this section, any general interest charge or other relevant penalty, if applicable for any unpaid amount of the liability, begins to accrue when the liability is due and payable under the relevant taxation law, or at that time as varied under section 25510 or 25520.

##### 25520  To bring forward the payment time in certain cases

    * (1) If the Commissioner reasonably believes that you may leave  before the time at which an amount of a *taxrelated liability becomes due and payable by you, the Commissioner may bring that time forward. If the Commissioner does so, that time is varied accordingly.

          * Note: General interest charge or any other relevant penalty, if applicable for any unpaid amount of the liability, will begin to accrue from the time as varied. See, for example, paragraph 515(a) of the _Income Tax Assessment Act 1997_.

    * (2) The Commissioner must do so by written notice given to you.

##### 255100  Commissioner may require security deposit

    * (1) The Commissioner may require you to give security for the due payment of an existing or future *taxrelated liability of yours if:

      * (a) the Commissioner has reason to believe that:

        * (i) you are establishing or *carrying on an *enterprise in Australia; and

        * (ii) you intend to carry on that enterprise for a limited time only; or

      * (b) the Commissioner reasonably believes that the requirement is otherwise appropriate, having regard to all relevant circumstances.

          * Note: A requirement to give security under this section is _not_ a taxrelated liability. As such, the collection and recovery provisions in this Part do not apply to it.

    * (2) The Commissioner may require you to give the security:

      * (a) by way of a bond or deposit (including by way of payments in instalments); or

      * (b) by any other means that the Commissioner reasonably believes is appropriate.

    * (3) The Commissioner may require you to give security under this section:

      * (a) at any time the Commissioner reasonably believes is appropriate; and

      * (b) as often as the Commissioner reasonably believes is appropriate.

          * Example: The Commissioner may require additional security if he or she reasonably believes that the original security requirement underestimated the amount of the likely taxrelated liability.

##### 255105  Notice of requirement to give security

      * (e) specify the time by which you are required to give the security; and

      * (f) explain how you may have the Commissioner's decision to require you to give the security reviewed.

    * (3) To avoid doubt, a single notice may relate to security for the payment of 2 or more existing or future *taxrelated liabilities, but must comply with subsection (2) in relation to each of them.

    * When notice is given

    * (4) Despite section 29 of the _Acts Interpretation Act 1901_, a notice under subsection (1) is taken to be given at the time the Commissioner leaves or posts it.

          * (a) amounts not paid as required by Part 25 of this Act (Pay as you go (PAYG) withholding); or

          * (b) unpaid superannuation guarantee charge;

    * and to recover the amount of the estimate.

    * If you are given an estimate, you are liable to pay the amount of the estimate. That liability is distinct from your liability to pay the amounts required by Part 25 or the _Superannuation Guarantee (Administration) Act 1992_. However, you can ensure that the Commissioner does not require you to pay more than the amounts not paid under that Part or Act.

    * Other Divisions of this Part provide for the recovery of amounts payable under this Division.

##### 2685  Object of Division

    * The object of this Division is to enable the Commissioner to take prompt and effective action to recover: 

      * (a) amounts not paid as required by Part 25 (Pay as you go (PAYG) withholding); or

      * (b) unpaid superannuation guarantee charge that has not been assessed.

##### Subdivision 268B--Making estimates

##### Table of sections

       * 26810	Commissioner may make estimate

       * 26815	Notice of estimate

##### 26810  Commissioner may make estimate

    * Estimate

    * (1) The Commissioner may estimate the unpaid and overdue amount of a liability (the **_underlying liability_**) of yours:

      * (a) under section 1670 in this Schedule (requirement to pay to the Commissioner amounts you have withheld under the Pay as you go withholding rules); or

      * (b) to pay superannuation guarantee charge for a *quarter under section 16 of the _Superannuation Guarantee (Administration) Act 1992_, to the extent the superannuation guarantee charge has not been assessed before the Commissioner makes the estimate.

    * (1A) For the purposes of this Division, your superannuation guarantee charge for a *quarter is treated as being payable on the day by which you must lodge a superannuation guarantee statement for the quarter under section 33 of the _Superannuation Guarantee (Administration) Act 1992_, even if, on that day, the charge has not been assessed under that Act.

    * Amount of estimate

    * (2) The amount of the estimate must be what the Commissioner thinks is reasonable.

    * (3) In making the estimate, the Commissioner may have regard to anything he or she thinks relevant.

          * Example 1: In the case of an underlying liability under section 1670 (requirement to pay to the Commissioner amounts you have withheld under the Pay as you go withholding rules), the Commissioner may have regard to information about amounts you withheld under the Pay as you go rules before the period in relation to which the underlying liability arose.

          * Example 2: In the case of an underlying liability to pay superannuation guarantee charge for a quarter, the Commissioner may have regard to information about your contributions to RSAs and complying superannuation funds for earlier quarters.

    * Only one estimate for each liability

    * (4) While the estimate is in force, the Commissioner cannot make another estimate relating to the underlying liability.

    * (5) For the purposes of subsection (4), the estimate is in force if:

      * (a) the Commissioner has given you notice of the estimate; and

      * (b) the estimate has not been revoked; and

      * (c) your liability to pay the estimate has not been discharged.

##### 26815  Notice of estimate

    * Commissioner must give notice of estimate

    * (1) The Commissioner must give you written notice of the estimate.

    * Content of notice

    * (2) The notice must:

      * (a) identify the underlying liability; and

      * (b) specify the date of the estimate; and

      * (c) set out the amount of the estimate; and

      * (d) state that the amount of the estimate is due and payable; and

      * (e) explain how you may have the amount of the estimate reduced or the estimate revoked.

    * (3) To avoid doubt, a single notice may relate to 2 or more estimates, but must comply with subsection (2) in relation to each of them.

    * When notice is given

    * (4) Despite section 29 of the _Acts Interpretation Act 1901_, a notice under subsection (1) is taken to be given at the time the Commissioner leaves or posts it.

          * Note: Section 28A of the _Acts Interpretation Act 1901 _may be relevant to giving a notice under subsection (1).

##### Subdivision 268C--Liability to pay estimates

##### Table of sections

       * 26820	Nature of liability to pay estimate

       * 26825	Accuracy of estimate irrelevant to liability to pay

       * 26830	Estimate provable in bankruptcy or winding up

##### 26820  Nature of liability to pay estimate

    * Liability to pay amount of estimate

    * (1) You must pay to the Commissioner the amount of the estimate if the Commissioner gives you notice of the estimate in accordance with section 26815. The amount is due and payable when the Commissioner gives you the notice.

          * Note: The amount of the estimate may be reduced, or the estimate revoked, under Subdivision 268D.

    * Liability to pay amount of estimate is distinct from underlying liability

    * (2) Your liability to pay the amount of the estimate is separate and distinct from the underlying liability. It is separate and distinct for all purposes.

          * Example: The Commissioner may take:

           * (a) proceedings to recover the unpaid amount of the estimate; or

           * (b) proceedings to recover the unpaid amount of the underlying liability; or

           * (c) proceedings of both kinds.

    * Discharging one liability discharges other liabilities

    * (3) Despite subsection (2), if, at a particular time, one of the liabilities to which this subsection applies is discharged, to the extent of an amount, for either of the following reasons, each of the other liabilities to which this subsection applies is discharged to the extent of the same amount:

      * (a) an amount is paid or applied towards discharging the liability;

      * (b) the liability is discharged because of section 26940 (Effect of director paying penalty or company discharging liability).

    * (4) Subsection (3) applies to whichever of the following liabilities are in existence at the particular time:

      * (a) your liability to pay the amount of the estimate;

      * (b) the underlying liability;

      * (c) a liability of yours under a judgment, to the extent that it is based on a liability referred to in paragraph (a) or (b).

    * (5) Subsection (3) does not discharge a liability to a greater extent than the amount of the liability.

##### 26825  Accuracy of estimate irrelevant to liability to pay

    * You are liable to pay the unpaid amount of the estimate even if: 

      * (a) the underlying liability never existed or has been discharged in full; or

      * (b) the unpaid amount of the underlying liability is less than the unpaid amount of the estimate.

          * Note 1: Section 26840 revokes the estimate if you give the Commissioner a statutory declaration, or file an affidavit, to the effect that the underlying liability never existed.

          * Note 2: Subdivision 268D provides ways in which you can challenge the estimate or its amount.

##### 26830  Estimate provable in bankruptcy or winding up

    * (1) Your liability (the **_estimate liability_**) to pay the unpaid amount of the estimate is provable in a bankruptcy or winding up, even if the estimate was made after:

      * (a) the date of the bankruptcy; or

      * (b) the relevant date (within the meaning of the _Corporations Act 2001_).

    * (2) However, the estimate liability is provable only to the extent that the underlying liability would be provable if the unpaid amount of the underlying liability were the same as the unpaid amount of the estimate.

          * Example: Subsection (2) prevents proof of the estimate liability if the underlying liability could not be proved because, for example, of when it arose.

    * (3) Subsections (1) and (2) do not apply if:

      * (a) the underlying liability has already been admitted to proof; and

      * (b) the proof has not been set aside.

    * (4) If the estimate liability has been admitted to proof at a particular amount, the underlying liability is provable only to the extent the unpaid amount of the underlying liability exceeds that particular amount.

    * (5) To the extent that a liability is provable because of this section, it is taken, for the purposes of the _Bankruptcy Act 1966_, to be provable in bankruptcy under that Act.

##### 26835  How estimate may be reduced or revoked--Commissioner's powers

    * Reduction

    * (1) The Commissioner may at any time reduce the amount of the estimate, but is not obliged to consider whether or not to do so.

    * (2) If the Commissioner reduces the amount of the estimate under subsection (1), he or she must give you a written notice that:

      * (a) identifies the underlying liability; and

      * (b) sets out the reduced amount of the estimate.

          * Note: The estimate is taken always to have had effect as reduced: see section 26855.

    * Revocation

    * (3) The Commissioner may at any time revoke the estimate, but is not obliged to consider whether or not to do so.

    * (4) If the Commissioner revokes the estimate under subsection (3), he or she must give you a written notice that:

      * (a) identifies the underlying liability; and

      * (b) states that the estimate has been revoked.

          * Note: The estimate is taken never to have been made: see section 26855.

    * Matters for Commissioner to consider

    * (5) In exercising his or her power under this section to reduce the amount of the estimate, or to revoke the estimate, the Commissioner must have regard to:

      * (a) the following principles:

        * (i) the estimate is of the unpaid amount of the underlying liability as at a particular time;

        * (ii) the purpose of reducing the amount of the estimate is to bring it closer to the unpaid amount of the underlying liability as at the time the estimate was made;

        * (iii) reductions of the unpaid amount of the underlying liability that happen after the time the estimate was made are dealt with by section 26820 (Nature of liability to pay estimate) and so should not be taken into account in exercising such a power; and

      * (b) the effects of sections 26855 and 26870 (effect of reduction or revocation on liabilities).

##### 26840  How estimate may be reduced or revoked--statutory declaration or affidavit

    * Scope

    * (1) This section applies as set out in the following table:

          * Example: For the purposes of item 2 of the table, taking a procedural step as a party to proceedings includes entering an appearance, filing a notice of intention to defend, or applying to set aside judgment entered in default of appearance.

          * Note 1: Section 459C of the _Corporations Act 2001_ creates a presumption that a company is insolvent, and may be wound up, if the company fails to comply with a statutory demand.

          * Note 2: See section 26890 for what the statutory declaration or affidavit must contain and who must make, swear or affirm it.

    * Reduction

    * (2) The amount of the estimate is reduced if the statutory declaration is to the effect, or the affidavit verifies facts sufficient to prove, that a specified lesser amount is the unpaid amount of the underlying liability.

          * Example: Subsection (2) will apply if the statutory declaration etc. is to the effect that the underlying liability has been discharged in full (and therefore the unpaid amount of the liability is nil).

    * (3) The amount of the reduction is the amount by which the unpaid amount of the estimate (just before the reduction) exceeds the amount specified.

          * Note: The effect of subsection (3) is to reduce the unpaid amount of the estimate to the amount specified.

    * Revocation

    * (4) The estimate is revoked if the statutory declaration is to the effect, or the affidavit verifies facts sufficient to prove, that the underlying liability never existed.

##### 26845  How estimate may be reduced or revoked--rejection of proof of debt

    * Scope

    * (1) This section applies if:

      * (a) the Commissioner lodges a proof of debt relating to the unpaid amount of the estimate; and

      * (b) section 26895 applies to an entity (your **_supervising entity_**) in relation to you.

    * Rejection of proof of debt

    * (2) Your supervising entity may give the Commissioner a statutory declaration to the effect that:

      * (a) the underlying liability has been discharged in full; or

      * (b) the unpaid amount of the underlying liability is a specified, lesser amount; or

      * (c) the underlying liability never existed.

          * Note: See section 26890 for what the statutory declaration must contain and who must make it.

    * (3) If your supervising entity does so, he or she may reject the proof of debt (in whole or in part) on the ground made out in the statutory declaration.

    * (4) If the Commissioner appeals, or applies for review of, your supervising entity's decision to reject the proof of debt, nothing in subsection (2) or (3) prevents evidence being adduced to contradict statements in the declaration.

          * Note: Such evidence might also be relevant to a prosecution for an offence, such as an offence against section 11 of the _Statutory Declarations Act 1959_ (False declarations).

    * Revocation or reduction of estimate

    * (5) The following table applies in relation to the outcome following all (if any) appeals from, and applications for review of, your supervising entity's decision to reject the proof of debt. (If there are no appeals or applications for review, the outcome is your supervising entity's decision as originally made.)

          * Note 1: The effect of item 1 of the table is to reduce the unpaid amount of the estimate to nil.

          * Note 2: The effect of item 2 of the table is to reduce the unpaid amount of the estimate to the amount admitted to proof.

##### 26850  How estimate may be reduced--amount paid or applied

    * (1) This section applies if:

      * (a) an amount is paid or applied towards discharging your liability to pay the amount of the estimate; and

      * (b) the amount paid or applied exceeds the unpaid amount of the underlying liability as at the time just before the payment or application.

    * (2) The amount of the estimate is reduced so that it does not exceed the unpaid amount, at the time mentioned in paragraph (1)(b), of the underlying liability.

##### 26855  When reduction or revocation takes effect

    * Scope

    * (1) This section applies for the purposes of the following:

      * (a) Subdivision 268C (Liability to pay estimates);

      * (b) section 26860 (refund of overpayments);

      * (c) Subdivision 268E (Late payment of estimates);

      * (d) Division 269 (Penalties for directors of noncomplying companies).

    * When reduction or revocation takes effect

    * (2) If the amount of the estimate is reduced, the estimate has effect, and is taken always to have had effect, as if the original amount of the estimate had been the reduced amount.

    * (3) If the estimate is revoked, the estimate is taken never to have been made.

##### 26860  Consequences of reduction or revocation--refund

    * (1) This section applies if:

      * (a) an amount is paid or applied towards discharging your liability to pay the amount of the estimate; and

      * (b) the amount paid or applied exceeds the unpaid amount of the estimate as at the time just before the payment or application.

          * Example: You pay an amount towards discharging the estimate and the estimate is later reduced to a lesser amount.

          * Note: Section 26850 provides for the reduction of the amount of the estimate in the case of overpayment.

    * (2) The Commissioner must pay you the excess.

          * Note: See Division 3A of Part IIB of this Act for the rules about how the Commissioner must pay you. Division 3 of that Part allows the Commissioner to apply the amount owing as a credit against tax debts that you owe the Commonwealth.

##### 26865  Consequences of reduction or revocation--statutory demand changed or set aside

    * Scope

    * (1) This section applies if:

      * (a) the estimate is of the unpaid amount of a liability of a company; and

      * (b) the Commissioner has served a *statutory demand on the company relating to the company's liability to pay the unpaid amount of the estimate; and

      * (c) the amount of the estimate is later reduced, or the estimate is revoked.

    * Statutory demand changed

    * (2) The *statutory demand is changed accordingly.

    * (3) The *statutory demand is taken to have had effect (as so changed) from the time the Commissioner served it on the company.

    * Statutory demand set aside

    * (4) The *statutory demand is set aside if subsection (2) reduces the amount of the debt (or the total of the amounts of the debts) below the statutory minimum (within the meaning of the _Corporations Act 2001_).

##### 26870  Consequences of reduction or revocation--underlying liability

    * Reduction of the amount of the estimate, or revocation of the estimate, does not affect the Commissioner's rights or remedies in relation to the underlying liability (except to the extent that this Division expressly provides otherwise).

##### Subdivision 268E--Late payment of estimates

##### Table of sections

       * 26875	Liability to pay the general interest charge

       * 26880	Effect of paying the general interest charge

##### 26875  Liability to pay the general interest charge

    * (1) This section applies if:

      * (a) your liability to pay the amount of the estimate remains undischarged at the end of 7 days after the Commissioner gives you notice of the estimate; and

      * (b) the underlying liability is not a liability to pay superannuation guarantee charge.

    * (2) You are liable to pay the *general interest charge on the unpaid amount of the estimate for each day in the period that:

      * (a) started at the beginning of the day by which the underlying liability was due to be paid; and

      * (b) finishes at the end of the last day on which, at the end of the day, any of the following remains unpaid:

        * (i) the amount of the estimate;

        * (ii) general interest charge on any of the amount of the estimate.

          * Note: The general interest charge is worked out under Part IIA of this Act.

##### 26880  Effect of paying the general interest charge

    * Scope

    * (1) If you are liable to pay the *general interest charge under section 26875 in relation to the estimate, this section applies to the following liabilities:

      * (a) your liability to pay the general interest charge;

      * (b) a liability of yours to pay a general interest charge, under a corresponding provision of Subdivision 16B, because the underlying liability remains undischarged;

      * (c) liability under a judgment, to the extent that it is based on a liability referred to in paragraph (a) or (b);

      * (d) a liability of yours to pay interest carried by a judgment debt, to the extent that the judgment debt is based on:

        * (i) the liability to pay the estimate; or

        * (ii) the liability to pay the general interest charge under section 26875 on an unpaid amount of the estimate.

    * Discharging one liability discharges other liabilities

    * (2) If, at a particular time, an amount is paid or applied towards discharging one of the liabilities, each of the other liabilities that is in existence at that time is discharged to the extent of the same amount.

    * (3) However, this section does not discharge a liability to a greater extent than the amount of the liability.

    * (4) If, because a judgment debt carries interest, section 8AAH of this Act reduces the amount of a *general interest charge payable as mentioned in paragraph (1)(b) of this section, the amount of the reduction is taken, for the purposes of subsection (2) of this section, to have been applied towards discharging your liability to the charge.

##### 26885  Effect of judgment on liability on which it is based

    * Scope

    * (1) This section applies to a statutory declaration given, or an affidavit filed, for the purposes of section 26840 or 26845 in relation to the estimate.

    * Content

    * (2) In a case covered by paragraph 26810(1)(a) (estimate of liability under requirement to pay to the Commissioner amounts you have withheld under the Pay as you go withholding rules), the statutory declaration or affidavit must verify the following facts:

      * (a) whichever of the following are applicable:

        * (i) the sum of all amounts you withheld under Division 12 during the relevant period, or the fact that you did not withhold any such amounts during the period;

        * (ii) the sum of all amounts you were required to pay under Division 13 (Alienated personal services payments) during the relevant period, or the fact that you were not required to pay any such amounts during the period;

        * (iii) the sum of all amounts you were required to pay under Division 14 (noncash benefits and accruing gains) during the relevant period, or the fact that you were not required to pay any such amounts during the period;

      * (a) your name and address;

      * (b) for each employee for whom you have an *individual superannuation guarantee shortfall for the relevant *quarter:

        * (i) the employee's name and postal address and, if the employee has *quoted the employee's *tax file number to you, the employee's tax file number; and

        * (ii) the amount of the shortfall;

      * (c) what has been done to comply with your obligation to pay the relevant superannuation guarantee charge to the Commissioner.

          * Note: The amount of the individual superannuation guarantee shortfall mentioned in paragraph (b) is a factor in determining the amount of the superannuation guarantee charge mentioned in paragraph 26810(1)(b). The lesser amount mentioned in subsection 26840(2) may therefore differ from the amount of that shortfall.

    * Maker or deponent

    * (3) The statutory declaration or affidavit must be made, sworn or affirmed by:

      * (a) an individual specified in the following table; or

      * (b) your liquidator, receiver or trustee in bankruptcy (if and as applicable).

      * (b) if subsection (2) applies and the Commissioner gave you the notice before the day when the relevant partner's property vested in, or control of the relevant partner's property passed to, the supervising entity--that day; or

      * (c) otherwise--the day when the Commissioner gave you the notice.

    * (5) If the Commissioner gives you and your supervising entity a notice at different times, each notice is taken to have been given at the later of those times.

      * (a) making false or misleading statements; and

      * (b) taking a position that is not reasonably arguable; and

      * (c) entering into *schemes; and

      * (d) refusing to provide documents to the Commissioner.

##### 28415  When a matter is reasonably arguable

    * (1) A matter is **_reasonably arguable_** if it would be concluded in the circumstances, having regard to relevant authorities, that what is argued for is about as likely to be correct as incorrect, or is more likely to be correct than incorrect.

          * Note: For the effect of transfer pricing documentation on when a matter is reasonably arguable, see Subdivision 284E.

    * (2) To the extent that a matter involves an assumption about the way in which the Commissioner will exercise a discretion, the matter is only **_reasonably arguable_** if, had the Commissioner exercised the discretion in the way assumed, a court would be about as likely as not to decide that the exercise of the discretion was in accordance with law.

    * (3) Without limiting subsection (1), these authorities are relevant:

      * (a) a *taxation law;

      * (b) material for the purposes of subsection 15AB(1) of the _Acts Interpretation Act 1901_;

      * (c) a decision of a court (whether or not an Australian court), the *AAT or a Board of Review;

      * (d) a *public ruling.

##### 28420  Which statements this Division applies to

    * This Division applies to a statement made orally, in a document or in any other way (including electronically) for a purpose connected with a *taxation law.

##### 28425  Statements by agents

    * This Division applies to a statement made by your agent as if it had been made by you.

##### 28430  Application of Division to trusts

    * If you are a trustee of a trust and: 

      * (a) you make a statement to the Commissioner or to an officer who is exercising powers or performing functions under a *taxation law about the trust; and

      * (b) the statement:

        * (i) is false or misleading in a material particular, whether because of things in it or omitted from it; or

        * (ii) treated an *income tax law as applying to a matter or identical matters in a particular way that was not *reasonably arguable; or

        * (iii) treated a taxation law as applying in a particular way to a *scheme;

    * this Division applies to you as if any *shortfall amount or *scheme shortfall amount of a beneficiary of the trust as a result of the statement were your shortfall amount or scheme shortfall amount.

##### 28435  Application of Division to partnerships

    * (1) If you are a partner in a partnership and:

      * (a) a statement about the partnership net income or partnership loss is made by a partner or the partnership's agent to the Commissioner or to an entity who is exercising powers or performing functions under a *taxation law about the partnership; and

      * (b) the statement:

        * (i) is false or misleading in a material particular, whether because of things in it or omitted from it; or

        * (ii) treated an *income tax law as applying to a matter or identical matters in a particular way that was not *reasonably arguable;

    * this Division applies to you as if you had made the statement.

    * (2) If you are a partner in a partnership and:

      * (a) the partnership participated in a *scheme; and

      * (b) the partnership net income would have been greater, or the partnership loss would have been smaller, apart from the scheme;

    * this Division applies to you as if the proportion of the *scheme benefit that is the same as your share of the partnership net income or partnership loss were your scheme benefit.

    * (7) If you wish to rely on subsection (6), you bear an evidential burden in relation to paragraph (6)(b).

##### 28480  Shortfall amounts

    * (1) You have a **_shortfall amount_** if an item in this table applies to you. That amount is the amount by which the relevant liability, or the payment or credit, is less than or more than it would otherwise have been.

    * (2) However, if:

      * (a) your shortfall amount arises in the situation covered by both item 1 in the table and item 1, 2 or 3 in the table in subsection 28490(1); and

      * (b) the statement is false or misleading because of errors mentioned in section 705315 of the _Income Tax Assessment Act 1997 _that were made in it and it was made before the Commissioner became aware of the errors, your **_shortfall amount_** is instead the amount worked out using the formula:

    * where: 

    * **_adjusted reset cost base asset setting amount _**means:

      * (a) the *tax cost setting amount, worked out under Division 705 of the _Income Tax Assessment Act 1997_, for all assets of a kind referred to in section 70535 of that Act as reset cost base assets that the *head company of the relevant group held continuously from the time when the *subsidiary member referred to in subsection 705315(2) of that Act joined the group until the start of the head company's income year in which the Commissioner became aware of the errors mentioned in section 705315 of that Act;

    * less: 

      * (b) the head company's deductions under Division 40 (except under Subdivision 40F, 40G, 40H or 40I) or Subdivision 328D of the _Income Tax Assessment Act 1997_ for those assets for all income years before the income year in which the Commissioner became aware of the errors.

    * **_original reset cost base asset setting amount _**means the *tax cost setting amount, worked out under Division 705 of the _Income Tax Assessment Act 1997_, for all reset cost base assets that the *subsidiary member held at the time it joined the group, other than assets that the *head company no longer held at the start of the earliest income year for which the Commissioner could amend the head company's assessment to correct any of the errors.

    * **_tax on capital gain_** means the product of:

      * (a) the *capital gain that the *head company makes as a result of *CGT event L6 happening as mentioned in section 104525 of the _Income Tax Assessment Act 1997_; and

      * (b) the *corporate tax rate in respect of taxable income for the income year in which that CGT event happens.

##### 28485  Amount of penalty

    * (1) Work out the *base penalty amount under section 28490. If the base penalty amount is not increased under section 284220 or reduced under section 284225, this is the amount of the penalty.

    * (2) Otherwise, use this formula:

    * where: 

    * **_BPA_** is the *base penalty amount.

    * **_increase %_** is the percentage increase (if any) under section 284220.

    * **_reduction %_** is the percentage reduction (if any) under section 284225.

##### 28490  Base penalty amount

    * (1) The **_base penalty amount_** under this Subdivision is worked out using this table and section 284224 if relevant:

    * (2) If 2 or more items in that table apply and one of them produces a greater *base penalty amount than any of the others, use that item.

    * (3) An entity's **_reasonably arguable threshold_** for an income year is:

      * (a) unless paragraph (b) applies--the greater of $10,000 or 1% of whichever of the following applies:

        * (i) the income tax payable by the entity for the income year, worked out on the basis of the entity's *income tax return;

        * (ii) the *petroleum resource rent tax payable by the entity for the year of tax (within the meaning of the _Petroleum Resource Rent Tax Assessment Act 1987_) most closely corresponding to the income year, worked out on the basis of the entity's return under Division 1 of Part VI of that Act; or

      * (b) if the entity is a trust or partnership--the greater of the following amounts:

        * (i) $20,000;

        * (ii) 2% of the entity's *net income (if any) for the income year worked out on the basis of the entity's *income tax return.

##### 28495  Joint and several liability of directors of corporate trustee that makes a false or misleading statement

    * (1) This section applies if a trustee of a *self managed superannuation fund, or of a fund that is treated as a self managed superannuation fund under subsection 10(4) of the _Superannuation Industry (Supervision) Act 1993_:

      * (a) is liable to an administrative penalty under subsection 28475(1) or (4); and

      * (b) is a body corporate.

    * (2) The directors of the body corporate at the time it becomes liable to the penalty are jointly and severally liable to pay the amount of the *taxrelated liability in respect of the penalty.

          * Note: See section 26545 for rules on joint liability.

       * _284155	Amount of penalty

       * 284160	_Base penalty amount_: schemes

##### Operative provisions

##### 284145  Liability to penalty

    * (1) You are liable to an administrative penalty if:

      * (a) you would, apart from a provision of a *taxation law or action taken under such a provision (the **_adjustment provision_**), get a *scheme benefit from a *scheme; and

      * (b) having regard to any relevant matters, it is reasonable to conclude that:

        * (i) an entity that (alone or with others) entered into or carried out the scheme, or part of it, did so with the sole or dominant purpose of that entity or another entity getting a scheme benefit from the scheme; or

        * (ii) for a scheme referred to in Division 165 of the *GST Act or Division 75 of the _Fuel Tax Act 2006_--the principal effect of the scheme, or of part of the scheme, is that you would, apart from the adjustment provision, get the scheme benefit from the scheme directly or indirectly.

    * (2A) You are also liable to an administrative penalty if:

      * (a) you would, apart from a determination under section 81530 of the _Income Tax Assessment Act 1997_ (also the **_adjustment provision_**), get a *scheme benefit from a *scheme; and

      * (b) subparagraph (1)(b)(i) is not satisfied for the scheme.

    * (2B) You are also liable to an administrative penalty if:

      * (a) to give effect to Subdivision 815B or 815C of the _Income Tax Assessment Act 1997 _(also the **_adjustment provision_**) in relation to a *scheme, the Commissioner:

        * (i) amends your assessment for an income year; or

        * (ii) serves you with one or more notices under subsection 128C(7) of the _Income Tax Assessment Act 1936_ in respect of income that is taken because of the application of the adjustment provision to have been derived in the income year; and

      * (b) as a result, you are liable to pay an additional amount of income tax or *withholding tax (as the case requires).

          * Note: Subdivisions 815B and 815C of the _Income Tax Assessment Act 1997_ apply the arm's length principle (about transfer pricing) to entities and permanent establishments respectively.

    * (3) It does not matter whether the *scheme, or any part of the scheme, was entered into or carried out inside or outside .

##### 284150  Scheme benefits and scheme shortfall amounts

    * (1) An entity gets a **_scheme benefit_** from a *scheme if:

      * (a) a *taxrelated liability of the entity for an accounting period is, or could reasonably be expected to be, less than it would be apart from the scheme or a part of the scheme; or

      * (b) an amount that the Commissioner must pay or credit to the entity under a *taxation law for an accounting period is, or could reasonably be expected to be, more than it would be apart from the scheme or a part of the scheme.

    * (2) The amount of the *scheme benefit that you would, apart from the adjustment provision, have got from the *scheme is called your **_scheme shortfall amount_**.

    * (3) However, to the extent that your scheme shortfall amount is due to errors mentioned in section 705315 of the _Income Tax Assessment Act 1997 _that were made in a statement that was made before the Commissioner became aware of the errors, your **_scheme shortfall amount_** is instead the amount worked out using the formula:

    * where: 

    * **_adjusted reset cost base asset setting amount_** means:

      * (a) the *tax cost setting amount, worked out under Division 705 of the _Income Tax Assessment Act 1997_, for all assets of a kind referred to in section 70535 of that Act as reset cost base assets that the *head company of the relevant group held continuously from the time when the *subsidiary member referred to in subsection 705315(2) of that Act joined the group until the start of the head company's income year in which the Commissioner became aware of the errors mentioned in section 705315 of that Act;

    * less: 

      * (b) the head company's deductions under Division 40 (except under Subdivision 40F, 40G, 40H or 40I) or Subdivision 328D of the _Income Tax Assessment Act 1997_ for those assets for all income years before the income year in which the Commissioner became aware of the errors.

    * **_original reset cost base asset setting amount _**means the *tax cost setting amount, worked out under Division 705 of the _Income Tax Assessment Act 1997_, for all reset cost base assets that the *subsidiary member held at the joining time, other than assets that the *head company no longer held at the start of the earliest income year for which the Commissioner could amend the head company's assessment to correct any of the errors.

    * **_tax on capital gain_** means the product of:

      * (a) the *capital gain that the *head company makes as a result of *CGT event L6 happening as mentioned in section 104525 of the _Income Tax Assessment Act 1997_; and

      * (b) the *corporate tax rate in respect of taxable income for the income year in which that CGT event happens.

    * Scheme shortfall amount for crossborder transfer pricing

    * (4) Despite subsection (2), your **_scheme shortfall amount_** for a *scheme to which subsection 284145(2B) applies is the total amount of additional income tax and *withholding tax you are liable to pay as mentioned in that subsection.

    * (5) Disregard your *scheme shortfall amount for a *scheme to which subsection 284145(1) applies to the extent that scheme shortfall amount is attributable to additional tax that is, or is part of, your scheme shortfall amount for a scheme to which subsection 284145(2B) applies.

##### 284155  Amount of penalty

    * (1) Work out the *base penalty amount under section 284160. If the base penalty amount is not increased under section 284220 or reduced under section 284225, this is the amount of the penalty.

    * (2) Otherwise, use this formula:

    * where: 

    * **_BPA_** is the *base penalty amount.

    * **_increase %_** is the percentage increase (if any) under section 284220.

    * **_reduction %_** is the percentage reduction (if any) under section 284225.

##### 284160  Base penalty amount: schemes

    * (1) The **_base penalty amount_** for a *scheme to which subsection 284145(1) applies is, subject to section 284224:

      * (a) 50% of your *scheme shortfall amount; or

      * (b) 25% of your scheme shortfall amount if it is *reasonably arguable that the adjustment provision does not apply.

    * (2) The **_base penalty amount_** for a *scheme to which subsection 284145(2A) applies is, subject to section 284224:

      * (a) 25% of your *scheme shortfall amount; or

      * (b) 10% of your scheme shortfall amount if it is *reasonably arguable that the adjustment provision does not apply.

    * (3) The **_base penalty amount_** for a *scheme to which subsection 284145(2B) applies is worked out using this table and section 284224 if relevant:

          * Note: For special rules about when transfer pricing treatment is not reasonably arguable, see Subdivision 284E.

##### 284165  Exception--threshold for penalty arising from crossborder transfer pricing

    * (1) You are not liable to an administrative penalty under subsection 284145(2B) if your *scheme shortfall amount is equal to or less than your *reasonably arguable threshold.

    * (2) You are also not liable to an administrative penalty under that subsection if:

      * (a) you have the *scheme shortfall amount because of section 28430 (about trusts); and

      * (b) the amount by which the trust would, apart from the application of Subdivision 815B or 815C of the _Income Tax Assessment Act 1997_, have had a greater *net income, or a lesser *tax loss, is equal to or less than the trust's *reasonably arguable threshold.

    * (3) You are also not liable to an administrative penalty under that subsection if:

      * (a) you have the *scheme shortfall amount because you are a partner in a partnership that participated in the *scheme; and

      * (b) the amount by which the partnership would, apart from the application of Subdivision 815B or 815C of that Act, have had a greater *net income, or a lesser *partnership loss, is equal to or less than the partnership's *reasonably arguable threshold.

    * Nil amounts

    * (4) For the purposes of this section:

      * (a) treat a trust or a partnership that has no *net income for an income year as having a net income for the year of a nil amount; and

      * (b) treat a trust that has no *tax loss for an income year as having a tax loss for the year of a nil amount; and

      * (c) treat a partnership that has no *partnership loss for an income year as having a partnership loss for the year of a nil amount.

##### 28680  Amount of penalty

    * (1) The amount of the penalty is worked out in this way:

      * (a) work out the *base penalty amount under subsection (2); and

      * (b) work out whether the base penalty amount is increased under subsection (3) or (4).

    * (2) The **_base penalty amount_** is:

      * (a) for failing to give a return, notice or other document on time or in the *approved form, as mentioned in subsection 28675(1), (2A), (2B), (2BA) or (2C)--1 penalty unit for each period of 28 days or part of a period of 28 days starting on the day when the document is due and ending when you give it (up to a maximum of 5 penalty units); or

      * (c) for failing to notify the happening of an event as mentioned in subsection 28675(4)--1 penalty unit for each period of 28 days or part of a period of 28 days starting on the day when the notification is due and ending when you notify the happening of the event (up to a maximum of 5 penalty units).

          * Note: See section 4AA of the _Crimes Act 1914_ for the current value of a penalty unit.

          * Example: An entity lodges a return 31 days late. The base penalty amount under subsection (2) is 2 penalty units.

    * (3) The *base penalty amount is multiplied by 2 if:

      * (a) the entity concerned is a *medium withholder for the month in which the return, notice or other document was required to be given; or

      * (b) the entity's assessable income for the income year in which the return, notice or other document is required to be given is more than $1 million but less than $20 million; or

      * (c) the entity's *current GST turnover worked out at a time in the month in which the return, notice or other document was required to be given is more than $1 million but less than $20 million.

    * (4) The *base penalty amount is multiplied by 5 if:

      * (a) the entity concerned is a *large withholder for the month when the return, notice or other document was required to be given; or

      * (b) the entity's assessable income for the income year in which the return, notice or other document is required to be given is $20 million or more; or

      * (c) the entity's *current GST turnover worked out at a time in the month in which the return, notice or other document was required to be given is $20 million or more.

    * (5) In working out the *base penalty amount, the amount of a penalty unit is the amount applying at the start of the relevant 28 day period.

    * (6) The fact that you have not yet given the relevant return, notice or other document does not prevent the Commissioner notifying you that you are liable to an administrative penalty under this Subdivision. That penalty may be later increased under this section.

          * Note: The Commissioner is required to notify you of an administrative penalty: see section 29810.

##### _**29050  Civil penalties

    * Promoter of tax exploitation scheme

    * (1) An entity must not engage in conduct that results in that or another entity being a *promoter of a *tax exploitation scheme.

    * Implementing scheme otherwise than in accordance with ruling

    * (2) An entity must not engage in conduct that results in a *scheme that has been promoted on the basis of conformity with a *product ruling being implemented in a way that is materially different from that described in the product ruling.

          * Note: A scheme will not have been implemented in a way that is materially different from that described in a product ruling if the tax outcome for participants in the scheme is the same as that described in the ruling.

    * (2A) For the purposes of subsection (2), disregard:

      * (a) subsection 82KZMGA(1A) of the _Income Tax Assessment Act 1936_; and

      * (b) subsection 39410(5A) of the _Income Tax Assessment Act 1997_.

          * Note 1: Those 2 subsections relate to forestry managed investment schemes.

          * Note 2: The effect of this subsection is that a scheme will have been implemented in a way that is materially different from that described in a product ruling if the tax outcome for participants in the scheme is the same as that described in the ruling only because of the operation of the subsections mentioned in paragraphs (a) and (b).

    * Civil penalty

    * (3) If the Federal Court of Australia is satisfied, on application by the Commissioner, that an entity has contravened subsection (1) or (2), the Court may order the entity to pay a civil penalty to the Commonwealth.

    * Amount of penalty

    * (4) The maximum amount of the penalty is the greater of:

      * (a) 5,000 penalty units (for an individual) or 25,000 penalty units (for a body corporate); and

      * (b) twice the consideration received or receivable (directly or indirectly) by the entity and *associates of the entity in respect of the *scheme.

          * Note: See section 4AA of the _Crimes Act 1914_ for the current value of a penalty unit.

    * Principles relating to penalties

    * (5) In deciding what penalty is appropriate for a contravention of subsection (1) or (2) by an entity, the Federal Court of Australia may have regard to all matters it considers relevant, including:

      * (a) the amount of the consideration received or receivable (directly or indirectly) by the entity and *associates of the entity in respect of the *scheme; and

      * (b) the deterrent effect that any penalty may have; and

      * (c) the amount of loss or damage incurred by scheme participants; and

      * (d) the nature and extent of the contravention; and

      * (e) the circumstances in which the contravention took place, including the deliberateness of the entity's conduct and whether there was an honest and reasonable mistake of law; and

      * (f) the period over which the conduct extended; and

      * (g) whether the entity took any steps to avoid the contravention; and

      * (h) whether the entity has previously been found by the Court to have engaged in the same or similar conduct; and

      * (i) the degree of the entity's cooperation with the Commissioner.

    * Recovery of penalty

    * (6) The penalty is a civil debt payable to the Commonwealth, and the Commissioner may, on behalf of the Commonwealth, enforce an order for an entity to pay the penalty as if it were an order made in civil proceedings against the entity to recover a debt due by the entity. The debt arising from the order is taken to be a judgment debt.

##### 29055  Exceptions

    * Reasonable mistake or reasonable precautions

    * (1) The Federal Court of Australia must not order the entity to pay a civil penalty if the entity satisfies the Court:

      * (a) that the conduct in respect of which the proceedings were instituted was due to a reasonable mistake of fact; or

      * (b) that:

        * (i) the conduct in respect of which the proceedings were instituted was due to the act or default of another entity, to an accident or to some other cause beyond the entity's control; and

        * (ii) the entity took reasonable precautions and exercised due diligence to avoid the conduct.

    * (2) The other entity referred to in paragraph (1)(b) does not include someone who was an employee or agent of the entity when the alleged conduct occurred.

    * Reliance on advice from the Commissioner

    * (3) The Commissioner must not make an application under section 29050 for conduct referred to in subsection 29050(1) in relation to an entity's involvement in a *scheme if:

      * (a) the scheme is based on treating a *taxation law as applying in a particular way; and

      * (b) that way agrees with:

        * (i) advice given to the entity or the entity's agent by or on behalf of the Commissioner; or

        * (ii) a statement in a publication approved in writing by the Commissioner.

    * Time limitation

    * (4) The Commissioner must not make an application under section 29050 in relation to an entity's involvement in a *tax exploitation scheme more than 4 years after the entity last engaged in conduct that resulted in the entity or another entity being a *promoter of the tax exploitation scheme.

    * (5) The Commissioner must not make an application under section 29050 in relation to an entity's involvement in a *scheme that has been promoted on the basis of conformity with a *product ruling more than 4 years after the entity last engaged in conduct in relation to implementation of the scheme.

    * (6) However, the limitation in subsection (4) or (5) does not apply to a *scheme involving tax evasion.

    * Exception where entity does not know result of conduct

    * (7) The Federal Court of Australia must not order an entity to pay a civil penalty in relation to the entity's engaging in conduct:

      * (a) that results in another entity being a *promoter of a *tax exploitation scheme; or

      * (b) that results in a *scheme that has been promoted on the basis of conformity with a *product ruling being implemented in a way that is materially different from that described in the product ruling;

    * if the entity satisfies the Court that the entity did not know, and could not reasonably be expected to have known, that the entity's conduct would produce that result.

    * Employees

    * (8) The Commissioner must not make an application under section 29050 in relation to an individual's involvement in a *scheme as an employee if the Federal Court of Australia has ordered the individual's employer to pay a civil penalty under this Division in relation to the same scheme.

##### 29060  Meaning of promoter

    * (1) An entity is a **_promoter_** of a *tax exploitation scheme if:

      * (a) the entity markets the scheme or otherwise encourages the growth of the scheme or interest in it; and

      * (b) the entity or an *associate of the entity receives (directly or indirectly) consideration in respect of that marketing or encouragement; and

      * (c) having regard to all relevant matters, it is reasonable to conclude that the entity has had a substantial role in respect of that marketing or encouragement.

    * (2) However, an entity is not a **_promoter_** of a *tax exploitation scheme merely because the entity provides advice about the *scheme.

    * (3) An employee is not to be taken to have had a substantial role in respect of that marketing or encouragement merely because the employee distributes information or material prepared by another entity.

##### 29065  Meaning of tax exploitation scheme

    * (1) A *scheme is a **_tax exploitation scheme_** if, at the time of the conduct mentioned in subsection 29050(1):

      * (a) one of these conditions is satisfied:

        * (i) if the scheme has been implemented--it is reasonable to conclude that an entity that (alone or with others) entered into or carried out the scheme did so with the sole or dominant purpose of that entity or another entity getting a *scheme benefit from the scheme;

        * (ii) if the scheme has not been implemented--it is reasonable to conclude that, if an entity (alone or with others) had entered into or carried out the scheme, it would have done so with the sole or dominant purpose of that entity or another entity getting a scheme benefit from the scheme; and

      * (b) one of these conditions is satisfied:

        * (i) if the scheme has been implemented--it is not *reasonably arguable that the scheme benefit is available at law;

        * (ii) if the scheme has not been implemented--it is not reasonably arguable that the scheme benefit would be available at law if the scheme were implemented.

          * Note: The condition in paragraph (b) would not be satisfied if the implementation of the scheme for all participants were in accordance with binding advice given by or on behalf of the Commissioner of Taxation (for example, if that implementation were in accordance with a public ruling under this Act, or all participants had private rulings under this Act and that implementation were in accordance with those rulings).

    * (2) In deciding whether it is *reasonably arguable that a *scheme benefit would be available at law, take into account any thing that the Commissioner can do under a *taxation law.

          * Example: The Commissioner may cancel a tax benefit obtained by a taxpayer in connection with a scheme under section 177F of the _Income Tax Assessment Act 1936_.

           * (a) the power under section 25510 to defer the time a taxrelated liability is due and payable; and

           * (b) the power under section 8AAG to remit general interest charge.

##### 34210  Power to waive right to payment of taxrelated liability

    * (1) The Commissioner may waive the Commonwealth's right to payment of all or part of a *taxrelated liability if the Commissioner is satisfied that:

      * (a) the waiver will facilitate the starting, conduct or ending (by settlement or otherwise) of proceedings under the _Proceeds of Crime Act 2002_; and

      * (b) the liability is connected with circumstances associated with the proceedings.

          * Note: The Commissioner may waive the right to payment only after the liability has arisen, but may do so whether or not the liability is due and payable.

          * Example: A liability is connected with circumstances associated with the proceedings if the liability arose because of activities constituting an offence to which the proceedings relate.

    * (2) In deciding whether to waive the right, the Commissioner must consider:

      * (a) the amount the Commonwealth will forgo as a result of the waiver and the time the Commonwealth could reasonably be expected to receive that amount apart from the waiver; and

      * (b) the amount the Commonwealth could reasonably be expected to receive as a result of the proceedings and the time the Commonwealth could reasonably be expected to receive that amount.

    * (3) Subsection (2) does not limit the matters that the Commissioner may consider in making the decision.

    * Extended operation of this section

    * (4) This section (except this subsection) applies in relation to a pecuniary liability to the Commonwealth that arises directly under a *taxation law, but is not a *taxrelated liability, in the same way as this section applies in relation to a taxrelated liability.

          * Example: This section applies to a civil penalty under Division 290 (which penalises certain conduct involving promotion of schemes) in the same way as this section applies to a taxrelated liability.

          * section 9 of the _Ombudsman Act 1976_;

    * A ruling binds the Commissioner if it applies to you and you act in accordance with it. If you do act in accordance with it and the law turns out to be less favourable to you than the ruling provides, you are protected by the ruling from any adverse consequences.

    * The Division also sets out some other general rules for rulings.

##### 3575  Object of this Part

    * (1) The object of this Part is to provide a way for you to find out the Commissioner's view about how certain laws administered by the Commissioner apply to you so that the risks to you of uncertainty when you are self assessing or working out your tax obligations or entitlements are reduced.

    * (2) This object is achieved by:

      * (a) making advice in the form of rulings by the Commissioner available on a wide range of matters and to many taxpayers; and

      * (b) ensuring that the Commissioner provides rulings in a timely manner; and

      * (c) enabling the Commissioner to obtain, and make rulings based on, relevant information; and

      * (d) protecting you from increases in tax and from penalties and interest where you rely on rulings; and

      * (e) protecting you from decreases in entitlements where you rely on rulings; and

      * (f) limiting the ways the Commissioner can alter rulings to your detriment; and

      * (g) giving you protection from interest charges where you rely on other advice from the Commissioner, or on the Commissioner's general administrative practice.

##### Rules for all rulings

##### 35750  Scope of Division

    * This Division applies to *public rulings, *private rulings and *oral rulings.

##### 35755  The provisions that are relevant for rulings

    * Provisions of Acts and regulations of which the Commissioner has the general administration are relevant for rulings if the provisions are about any of the following: 

      * (a) *tax;

      * (b) *Medicare levy;

      * (c) fringe benefits tax;

      * (d) *franking tax;

      * (e) *withholding tax;

      * (f) *mining withholding tax;

      * (fa) *petroleum resource rent tax;

      * (fb) *indirect tax;

      * (fc) *excise duty;

      * (g) the administration or collection of those taxes, levies and duties;

      * (h) a grant or benefit mentioned in section 8 of the _Product Grants and Benefits Administration Act 2000_, or the administration or payment of such a grant or benefit;

      * (i) a *net fuel amount, or the administration of a net fuel amount;

      * (ia) an *assessed net fuel amount, or the collection or payment of an assessed net fuel amount;

      * (j) a *net amount, or the administration of a net amount;

      * (ja) an *assessed net amount, or the collection or payment of an assessed net amount;

      * (k) a *wine tax credit, or the administration or payment of a wine tax credit.

##### 35760  When rulings are binding on the Commissioner

    * (1) Subject to subsection (5), a ruling binds the Commissioner in relation to you (whether or not you are aware of the ruling) if:

      * (a) the ruling applies to you; and

      * (b) you rely on the ruling by acting (or omitting to act) in accordance with the ruling.

          * Example 1: A public ruling is expressed to apply to a class of entities in relation to a particular scheme. Tim is a member of that class of entities and he is one of a number of taxpayers who enter into that scheme. The ruling applies to Tim.

          * Tim relies on the ruling by lodging an income tax return that is in accordance with the ruling.

          * Under the ruling, Tim's deductions in relation to the scheme are worked out to be a particular amount. Because Tim has relied on the ruling, the Commissioner must use that amount in making Tim's assessment (unless Tim stops relying on the ruling or the law is more favourable to him: see sections 35765 and 35770).

          * Example 2: Cecelia applies for, and obtains, a private ruling that, when she makes a payment in specified circumstances, she would not have to withhold an amount under a relevant provision. Cecelia makes the payment in the circumstances specified in the ruling, so the ruling applies to her.

          * Cecelia relies on the ruling by not withholding an amount from the payment. The Commissioner must not apply the provision in relation to Cecelia in a way that is inconsistent with the ruling (unless Cecelia stops relying on the ruling or the law is more favourable to her: see sections 35765 and 35770).

          * Example 3: Cathie obtains a private ruling that a type of supply she makes is GSTfree. She relies on the ruling by:

           * (a) giving her customers invoices that show no GST payable on the supplies; and

           * (b) lodging her GST return on the basis that the supplies are GSTfree.

          * The Commissioner must administer the GST law in relation to Cathie on the basis that the supplies to which the ruling relates are GSTfree. This does not apply if Cathie stops relying on the ruling, such as by issuing tax invoices that show GST payable on the supplies: see paragraph (1)(b).

          * Note 1: A ruling about the amount of tax payable that binds the Commissioner provides protection in relation to that amount. There is no shortfall interest charge or tax shortfall penalty payable in respect of that amount as there can be no shortfall in tax payable.

          * Note 2: A ruling about the operation of a provision would stop applying to you if the provision is repealed, or is amended to have a different effect. However, if the provision is reenacted and expresses the same ideas as the old provision, the ruling would still apply: see section 35785.

    * (2) You may rely on the ruling at any time unless prevented from doing so by a time limit imposed by a *taxation law. It is not necessary to do so at the first opportunity.

    * GST rulings

    * (3) The *GST payable on a *supply or importation is the amount worked out in accordance with a ruling (if any) that:

      * (a) relates to the GST payable on the supply or importation; and

      * (b) binds the Commissioner in relation to the supplier or importer.

          * Note: The ruling will stop affecting the GST payable if the supplier or importer stops relying on the ruling: see paragraph (1)(b).

    * (4) Subsection (3) does not apply for the purposes of an objection to the ruling under section 35960.

    * Indirect tax rulings

    * (5) An *indirect tax or excise ruling (except to the extent that the ruling relates to an *excise law) binds the Commissioner in relation to:

      * (a) an entity (the **_representative entity_**) that is:

        * (i) the *representative member of a *GST group; or

        * (ii) the *joint venture operator of a *GST joint venture; or

        * (iii) the *representative of an *incapacitated entity; and

      * (b) an entity (the **_member entity_**) that is:

        * (i) a *member of the GST group; or

        * (ii) a *participant in the GST joint venture; or

        * (iii) the incapacitated entity;

    * if, and only if, both the representative entity and the member entity rely on the ruling by acting (or omitting to act) in accordance with the ruling.

    * (6) Subsection (5) applies if:

      * (a) the ruling applies to the member entity; and

      * (b) the ruling relates to what would be:

        * (i) a liability of the member entity to *indirect tax; or

        * (ii) an entitlement of the member entity to a credit (other than a *fuel tax credit) under an *indirect tax law; or

        * (iii) an *increasing adjustment, a *decreasing adjustment, or a luxury car tax adjustment (within the meaning of the *Luxury Car Tax Act), that the member entity has;

      * if the rules in the indirect tax law relating to *GST groups, *GST joint ventures or *incapacitated entities did not apply; and

      * (c) because of those rules:

        * (i) if that indirect tax were payable, it would be payable by the representative entity; or

        * (ii) if there was an entitlement to that credit, it would be an entitlement of the representative entity; or

        * (iii) if any entity had that adjustment, it would be an adjustment that the representative entity had.

##### 35765  Stopping relying on a ruling

    * (1) You can stop relying on a ruling. You do this by acting (or omitting to act) in a way that is not in accordance with the ruling.

          * Note: There is no penalty for a shortfall resulting from failing to follow a ruling. However, there are penalties for shortfalls resulting from failing to take reasonable care, and from taking a position about a large income tax item that is not reasonably arguable: see Division 284.

    * (2) You may stop relying on a ruling at any time unless prevented from doing so by a time limit imposed by a *taxation law.

    * (3) Having stopped relying on a ruling, you may rely on the ruling again unless prevented from doing so by a time limit imposed by a *taxation law.

##### 35770  Commissioner may apply the law if more favourable than the ruling

    * (1) The Commissioner may apply a relevant provision to you in the way it would apply if you had not relied on a ruling if:

      * (a) doing so would produce a more favourable result for you; and

      * (b) the Commissioner is not prevented from doing so by a time limit imposed by a *taxation law.

    * (2) The Commissioner does not have a duty to consider whether to apply subsection (1) to you, whether he or she is requested to do so by you or by any other entity.

##### 35775  Inconsistent rulings

    * (1) The rules in this table have effect if:

      * (a) a ruling and a later ruling both apply to you; and

      * (b) the 2 rulings are inconsistent.

    * However, the rules in the table only apply to the extent of the inconsistency, and do not apply to *indirect tax or excise rulings.

    * (1A) If:

      * (a) 2 inconsistent *indirect tax or excise rulings apply to you; and

      * (b) the rulings are both *public rulings;

    * then, to the extent of the inconsistency, you may rely on either of the rulings.

    * (1B) If:

      * (a) 2 inconsistent *indirect tax or excise rulings apply to you; and

      * (b) at least one of the rulings is not a *public ruling;

    * then, to the extent of the inconsistency:

      * (c) the later ruling is taken to apply from the later of:

        * (i) the time it is made; and

        * (ii) the time (if any) specified in the ruling as being the time from which it begins to apply; and

      * (d) the earlier ruling is taken to cease to apply at that later time.

    * (2) If 3 or more rulings apply to you and the rulings are inconsistent, apply the rules in this section to each combination of 2 rulings in the order in which they were made.

##### 35780  Contracts for schemes

    * For the purposes of this Part, if a contract requiring a *scheme has been entered into, the scheme is taken to have begun to be carried out.

##### 35785  Effect on ruling if relevant provision reenacted

    * If: 

      * (a) the Commissioner makes a ruling about a relevant provision (the **_old provision_**); and

      * (b) that provision is reenacted or remade (with or without modifications, and whether or not the old provision is repealed);

    * the ruling is taken also to be a ruling about that provision as reenacted or remade (the **_new provision_**), but only so far as the new provision expresses the same ideas as the old provision.

          * Note 1: Section 35755 specifies the relevant provisions.

          * Note 2: Ideas in taxation provisions are not necessarily different just because different forms of words are used: see section 15AC of the _Acts Interpretation Act 1901_ and section 13 of the _Income Tax Assessment Act 1997_.

##### 35790  Validity of ruling not affected by formal defect

    * The validity of a ruling is not affected merely because a provision of this Part relating to the form of the ruling or the procedure for making it has not been complied with.

##### Common rules for public and private rulings

##### 35795  Electronic communications

    * A communication between the Commissioner and another entity made for the purposes of a *public ruling or *private ruling may be made electronically.

##### 357100  Evidence

    * The production of: 

      * (a) a *public ruling or *private ruling; or

      * (b) a document signed by the Commissioner, a *Second Commissioner or a *Deputy Commissioner, purporting to be a copy of the ruling or of a notice of withdrawal of a public ruling;

    * is conclusive evidence of the proper making of the ruling, or of the withdrawal of the public ruling.

##### Common rules for private and oral rulings

##### 357105  Further information must be sought

    * (1) If the Commissioner considers that further information is required to make a *private ruling or an *oral ruling, the Commissioner must request the applicant to give that information to him or her.

          * Note: The Commissioner should make a private ruling within 60 days. However, if the Commissioner requests further information under this section, that period is extended: see subsection 35950(2).

    * (2) The Commissioner may decline to make the ruling if the applicant does not give the information to the Commissioner within a reasonable time.

          * Note: The Commissioner must give the applicant written reasons for declining to make a private ruling: see section 35935.

##### 357110  Assumptions in making private or oral ruling

    * (1) If the Commissioner considers that the correctness of a *private ruling or an *oral ruling would depend on which assumptions were made about a future event or other matter, the Commissioner may:

      * (a) decline to make the ruling; or

      * (b) make such of the assumptions as the Commissioner considers to be most appropriate.

    * (2) Before making the ruling, the Commissioner must:

      * (a) tell the applicant which assumptions (if any) the Commissioner proposes to make; and

      * (b) give the applicant a reasonable opportunity to respond.

          * Note: The Commissioner should make a private ruling within 60 days. However, if the Commissioner tells the applicant about assumptions the Commissioner proposes to make under this section, that period is extended: see subsection 35950(2).

##### 357115  Additional information provided by applicant

    * In considering an application for a *private ruling or an *oral ruling, the Commissioner may take into account additional information provided by the applicant after the application was made (whether in response to a request under section 357105 or otherwise).

##### 357120  Commissioner may take into account information from third parties

    * In making a *private ruling or an *oral ruling, the Commissioner may take into account any relevant information provided by an entity other than the applicant (whenever it was provided) if the Commissioner:

      * (a) tells the applicant what that information is and that the Commissioner intends to take the information into account; and

      * (b) gives the applicant a reasonable opportunity to respond before making the ruling.

          * Note: The Commissioner should make a private ruling within 60 days. However, if the Commissioner tells the applicant about third party information under this section, that period is extended: see subsection 35950(2).

##### 357125  Applications and objections not to affect obligations and powers

    * The fact that you have applied for a *private ruling or an *oral ruling, or have made an objection against a private ruling, does not affect:

      * (a) your obligation to lodge a return or do anything else; or

      * (b) the Commissioner's power to make or amend an assessment or do anything else.

##### Division 358--Public rulings

      * (b) entities generally, or a class of entities, in relation to a class of *schemes; or

      * (c) entities generally, or a class of entities, in relation to a particular scheme.

          * Note: Section 35755 specifies the relevant provisions.

    * (3) Such a ruling is a **_public ruling_** if it:

      * (a) is published; and

      * (b) states that it is a public ruling.

    * (4) The Commissioner must publish notice of the making of a *public ruling in the _Gazette_.

          * Note: The validity of a ruling is not affected merely because a provision of this Part relating to the form of the ruling or the procedure for making it has not been complied with: see section 35790.

##### 35810  Application of public rulings

    * (1) A *public ruling applies from the time it is published or from such earlier or later time as is specified in the ruling.

    * (2) A *public ruling, other than an *indirect tax or excise ruling, that relates to a *scheme does not apply to you if the scheme has begun to be carried out when the ruling is published and:

      * (a) the ruling changes the Commissioner's general administrative practice; and

      * (b) the ruling is less favourable to you than the practice.

##### 35815  When a public ruling ceases to apply

    * (1) A *public ruling may specify the time at which it ceases to apply.

    * (2) If a *public ruling does not do this, it applies until it is withdrawn.

    * (3) To the extent that a *public ruling, other than an *indirect tax or excise ruling, is withdrawn, it continues to apply to *schemes to which it applied that had begun to be carried out before the withdrawal but does not apply to schemes that begin to be carried out after the withdrawal.

          * Note: A scheme is taken to have begun to be carried out if a contract requiring the scheme has been entered into: see section 35780.

    * (4) The Commissioner must publish notice of the withdrawal of a *public ruling in the _Gazette_.

##### Division 359--Private rulings

##### Guide to Division 359

##### 3591  What this Division is about

    * The Commissioner must make the ruling applied for, except in certain cases. If you are entitled to receive a ruling, you can object if the Commissioner takes too long to make it.

    * The Commissioner must record the ruling in writing and give a copy of it to you. The ruling must include certain details.

    * If you are dissatisfied with the ruling, you may object to it.

##### Private rulings

##### 3595  Private rulings

    * (1) The Commissioner may, on application, make a written ruling on the way in which the Commissioner considers a relevant provision applies or would apply to you in relation to a specified *scheme. Such a ruling is called a **_private ruling_**.

          * Note: Section 35755 specifies the relevant provisions.

    * (2) A *private ruling may cover any matter involved in the application of the provision.

##### 35910  Applying for a private ruling

    * (1) You, your *agent or your *legal personal representative may apply to the Commissioner for a *private ruling.

    * (2) An application for a *private ruling must be made in the *approved form.

    * (3) You, your *agent or your *legal personal representative may withdraw the application at any time before the ruling is made. The Commissioner must confirm the withdrawal in writing.

##### 35915  Private rulings to be given to applicants

    * The Commissioner makes a *private ruling by recording the ruling in writing and giving a copy of it to the applicant. The copy may be given electronically.

##### 35920  Private rulings must contain certain details

    * (1) A *private ruling must state that it is a private ruling.

    * (2) A *private ruling must identify the entity to whom it applies and specify the relevant *scheme and the relevant provision to which it relates.

          * Note 1: The Commissioner must tell the applicant which assumptions the Commissioner made in making the ruling: see section 357110.

          * Note 2: Section 35755 specifies the relevant provisions.

##### 35925  Time of application of private rulings

    * (1) A *private ruling may specify the time from which it begins to apply and the time at which it ceases to apply.

    * (2) The specified start time, or end time, may be before, when, or after the *private ruling is made and may be determined by reference to a specified event.

    * (3) A *private ruling that does not specify a start time applies from the time when it is made.

    * (4) A *private ruling, other than an *indirect tax or excise ruling, that does not specify an end time ceases to apply at the end of the income year or other accounting period in which it started to apply.

          * Note: A private ruling that:

           * (a) is an indirect tax or excise ruling; and

           * (b) does not specify an end time;

          *  continues to apply until it is overridden by a later indirect tax or excise ruling: see subsection 35775(1B).

##### 35930  Ruling for trustee of a trust

    * A *private ruling given to or for the trustee of a trust and relating to the affairs of the trust also applies to:

      * (a) if the ruling is not an *indirect tax or excise ruling--the beneficiaries of the trust; and

      * (b) in any case--another trustee who is appointed to replace a trustee.

##### 35935  Dealing with applications

    * (1) The Commissioner must comply with an application for a *private ruling and make the ruling. However, this obligation is subject to subsections (2) and (3).

    * (2) The Commissioner may decline to make a *private ruling if:

      * (a) the Commissioner considers that making the ruling would prejudice or unduly restrict the administration of a *taxation law; or

      * (b) the matter sought to be ruled on is already being, or has been, considered by the Commissioner for you.

    * (3) The Commissioner may also decline to make a *private ruling if the matter sought to be ruled on is how the Commissioner would exercise a power under a relevant provision and the Commissioner has decided or decides whether or not to exercise the power.

          * Example: Michael applies for a private ruling on the way in which the Commissioner might exercise the Commissioner's discretion under section 25510 (deferring the payment time). Rather than make the ruling, the Commissioner decides to defer the time at which an amount would otherwise be payable by Michael.

          * Note: The Commissioner may also decline to make a private ruling if:

           * (a) the Commissioner has requested the applicant to give further information under section 357105 and the applicant has not given it to the Commissioner within a reasonable time; or

           * (b) the Commissioner considers that the correctness of a private ruling would depend on which assumptions were made about a future event or other matter (see section 357110).

    * (4) The Commissioner must give the applicant written reasons for declining to make a *private ruling.

##### 35940  Valuations

    * (1) If making a *private ruling would require determining the value of any thing, the Commissioner may:

      * (a) refer the valuation to a valuer; or

      * (b) refer a valuation provided by the applicant to a valuer for review.

          * Note: The Commissioner may request further information: see section 357105.

    * (2) If the Commissioner refers the valuation to a valuer, the Commissioner must tell the applicant that he or she has done so.

    * (3) When the valuer has completed its work in relation to the valuation, the Commissioner must tell the applicant that it has done so.

          * Note: The Commissioner should make a private ruling within 60 days. However, if the Commissioner refers a valuation to a valuer under this section, that period is extended: see subsection 35950(2).

    * (4) The Commissioner may charge the applicant an amount in accordance with the regulations for the valuer making or reviewing the valuation.

    * (5) This section does not apply to a valuation of a gift or contribution for the purposes of Division 30 of the _Income Tax Assessment Act 1997_.

##### 35945  Related rulings

    * If the Commissioner is making a *private ruling (the **_first ruling_**) you sought on the way in which, in the Commissioner's opinion, a relevant provision applies or would apply to you, the Commissioner may:

##### 35950  Delays in making private rulings

    * (1) The applicant for a *private ruling may give the Commissioner a written notice requiring him or her to make the ruling if, at the end of 60 days after the application was made, the Commissioner has neither:

      * (a) made the ruling; nor

      * (b) told the applicant that the Commissioner has declined to make the ruling.

    * (2) The 60 day period mentioned in subsection (1) is extended in a circumstance applicable under the table by the extension period applicable to that circumstance. If 2 or more circumstances are applicable, ignore any overlap between the periods of extension.

    * (3) The applicant may object, in the manner set out in Part IVC, against the Commissioner's failure to make the ruling if the Commissioner:

      * (a) does not make the ruling within 30 days of the notice under subsection (1) being given; and

##### 35955  Revised private rulings

    * (1) The Commissioner may make a revised *private ruling that applies to you if:

      * (a) the Commissioner had previously made a private ruling that applies to you; and

    * (2) The Commissioner must give you a copy of the revised *private ruling. The copy may be given electronically.

    * (3) The Commissioner may make the revised *private ruling whether or not there is an application for the revised ruling.

    * the ruling in its initial form stops applying to you at the time so specified.

##### 35960  Objections, reviews and appeals relating to private rulings

    * (1) You may object against a *private ruling that applies to you in the manner set out in Part IVC if you are dissatisfied with it.

##### 35965  Commissioner may consider new information on objection

    * (1) In deciding whether to allow (wholly or in part), or to disallow, an objection under Part IVC against a *private ruling, the Commissioner may consider any additional information that the Commissioner did not consider when making the ruling.

    * (2) For information you do not have, the Commissioner must tell you what the information is and give you a reasonable opportunity to respond before allowing or disallowing the objection.

    * (3) However, if the Commissioner considers that the additional information is such that the *scheme to which the application related is materially different from the scheme to which the ruling relates:

      * (a) the Commissioner must request the applicant to make an application for another *private ruling; and

      * (b) the objection is taken not to have been made.

##### 35970  Successful objection decision alters ruling

    * A *private ruling has effect as altered by an objection decision (within the meaning of Part IVC) made by the Commissioner if:

      * (a) the Commissioner made the decision allowing, wholly or in part, a taxation objection (within the meaning of that Part) against the ruling; and

      * (b) the period in which an appeal against, or an application for the review of, the decision may be made has ended without such an appeal or application being made.

##### Division 360--Oral rulings

##### Guide to Division 360

##### 3601  What this Division is about

    * The Commissioner must give the ruling unless he or she considers that the advice you are seeking relates to a business matter or a complex matter.

    * The Commissioner must give the ruling orally and must give you a registration identifier for the ruling.

          * Note: Division 357 has some common rules that affect oral rulings.

      * (b) the existence or amount of any kind of benefit (however the benefit is expressed) relating to taxation under any Commonwealth law;

           *  Example: Examples of benefits covered by paragraph (b) are deductions, credits and offsets under the _Income Tax Assessment Act 1997_, and input tax credits under the GST Act.
