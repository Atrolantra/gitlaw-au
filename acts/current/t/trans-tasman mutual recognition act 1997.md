##### 11  Requirements that do not need to be complied with

    * The further requirements referred to in section 10 are any one or more of the following requirements relating to sale that are imposed by or under the law of the Australian jurisdiction concerned: 

     * (a) a requirement that the goods satisfy standards of the jurisdiction relating to the goods themselves, including for example requirements relating to their production, composition, quality or performance;

##### 12  Requirements that do need to be complied with 

    * (1) The TransTasman mutual recognition principle is subject to the exceptions specified in this section.

    * (2) The first exception is that the principle does not affect the operation of any laws of an Australian jurisdiction that regulate the manner of the sale of goods in the jurisdiction or the manner in which sellers conduct or are required to conduct their business in the jurisdiction (including laws set out in the examples below), so long as those laws apply equally to goods produced in or imported into the jurisdiction.

       * Examples: Laws relating to the following:

        * (a) the contractual aspects of the sale of goods;

        * (b) the registration of sellers or other persons carrying on occupations;

        * (c) the requirement for business franchise licences;

        * (d) the persons to whom goods may or may not be sold;

        * (e) the circumstances in which goods may or may not be sold.

    * (3) The second exception is that the principle does not affect the operation of any laws of an Australian jurisdiction regarding the transportation, storage or handling of goods within the jurisdiction, so long as:

     * (a) those laws apply equally to goods produced in or imported into the jurisdiction; and 

     * (b) those laws are directed at matters affecting health and safety of persons in the jurisdiction or at preventing, minimising or regulating environmental pollution (including air, water, noise or soil pollution) in the jurisdiction.

    * (4) The third exception is that the principle does not affect the operation of any laws of an Australian jurisdiction regarding the inspection of goods within the jurisdiction, so long as:

     * (a) inspection or the requirement for inspection is not a prerequisite to the sale of the goods in the jurisdiction; and 

     * (b) those laws apply equally to goods produced in or imported into the jurisdiction; and 

     * (c) those laws are directed at matters affecting the health and safety of persons in the jurisdiction or at preventing, minimising or regulating environmental pollution (including air, water, noise or soil pollution) in the jurisdiction.

##### 13  Defences to offences regarding sale

    * (1) It is a defence to a prosecution for an offence against a law of an Australian jurisdiction in relation to the sale of any goods if the defendant expressly claims that the TransTasman mutual recognition principle applies and establishes that:

     * (a) the goods were labelled at the point of sale with a statement to the effect that the goods were produced in or imported into New Zealand; and

     * (b) the defendant had no reasonable grounds for suspecting that they were not so produced or imported.

    * (2) The defence is not available if the prosecution proves that the TransTasman mutual recognition principle did not apply in the circumstances of the alleged offence (because for example the goods did not comply with requirements imposed by the law of ).

    * (3) Any relevant presumptions or evidentiary procedures under the law of  are available to the prosecution or defendant in relation to matters sought to be proved by the prosecution under subsection (2).

#### Division 1--Preliminary

##### 15  TransTasman mutual recognition principle

    * (1) The TransTasman mutual recognition principle as applying to occupations is as set out in this Part.

    * (2) This Part deals with the ability of a person who is registered in connection with an occupation in  to carry on an equivalent occupation in .

##### 16  Entitlement to carry on occupation 

    * (1) The TransTasman mutual recognition principle is that, subject to this Part, a person who is registered in  for an occupation is, by virtue of this Act, entitled after notifying the local registration authority of an Australian jurisdiction for the equivalent occupation:

     * (a) to be registered in the jurisdiction for the equivalent occupation; and 

     * (b) pending such registration, to carry on the equivalent occupation in the jurisdiction.

    * (2) However, the TransTasman mutual recognition principle is subject to the exception that it does not affect the operation of laws that regulate the manner of carrying on an occupation in an Australian jurisdiction, so long as those laws:

     * (a) apply equally to all persons carrying on or seeking to carry on the occupation under the law of the jurisdiction; and 

     * (b) are not based on the attainment or possession of some qualification or experience relating to fitness to carry on the occupation.

##### 17  Application of this Part

    * (1) This Part applies to individuals and occupations carried on by them.

    * (2) This Part extends to an occupation carried on by an individual, where the individual is subject to more than one system of registration or more than one local registration authority in a participating jurisdiction, and accordingly this Part applies in relation to each such system of registration and each such authority.

    * (3) Without limiting subsection (2), an example of such an occupation is that of a legal practitioner, which involves both the admission as a legal practitioner by a court and the issue of a practising certificate by another body.

#### Division 2--Entitlement to registration

##### 18  Notification to local registration authority

    * (1) A person who is registered in  for an occupation may lodge a written notice with the local registration authority of an Australian jurisdiction for the equivalent occupation, seeking registration for the equivalent occupation in accordance with the TransTasman mutual recognition principle.

    * (2) The notice must:

     * (a) state that the person is registered for the occupation in ; and 

     * (b) state the occupation for which registration is sought and that it is being sought in accordance with the TransTasman mutual recognition principle; and 

     * (c) specify all the participating jurisdictions in which the person has substantive registration for equivalent occupations; and

     * (d) state that the person is not the subject of disciplinary proceedings in any participating jurisdiction (including any preliminary investigations or action that might lead to disciplinary proceedings) in relation to those occupations; and 

     * (e) state that the person's registration in any participating jurisdiction is not cancelled or currently suspended as a result of disciplinary action; and 

     * (f) state that the person is not otherwise personally prohibited from carrying on any such occupation in any participating jurisdiction, and is not subject to any special conditions in carrying on that occupation, as a result of criminal, civil or disciplinary proceedings in any participating jurisdiction; and

     * (g) specify any special conditions to which the person is subject in carrying on any such occupation in any participating jurisdiction; and 

     * (h) give consent to the making of inquiries of, and the exchange of information with, the authorities of any participating jurisdiction regarding the person's activities in the relevant occupation or occupations or otherwise regarding matters relevant to the notice.

    * (3) The notice must be accompanied by a document that is either the original or a copy of the instrument evidencing the person's existing registration (or, if there is no such instrument, by sufficient information to identify the person and the person's registration).

    * (4) As regards the instrument evidencing the person's existing registration, the person must certify in the notice that the accompanying document is the original or a complete and accurate copy of the original.

    * (5) The statements and other information in the notice must be verified by statutory declaration.

    * (6) The local registration authority may permit the notice to be amended after it is lodged.

##### 19  Entitlement to registration and continued registration

    * (1) A person who lodges a notice under section 18 with a local registration authority of an Australian jurisdiction is entitled to be registered in the equivalent occupation, as if the law of the jurisdiction that deals with registration expressly provided that registration in New Zealand is a sufficient ground of entitlement to registration.

    * (2) The local registration authority may grant registration on that ground and may grant renewals of such registration.

    * (3) Once a person is registered on that ground, the entitlement to registration continues, whether or not registration (including any renewal of registration) ceases in .

    * (4) Continuance of registration is otherwise subject to the laws of the jurisdiction, to the extent to which those laws:

     * (a) apply equally to all persons carrying on or seeking to carry on the occupation under the law of the jurisdiction; and 

     * (b) are not based on the attainment or possession of some qualification or experience relating to fitness to carry on the occupation.

    * (5) The local registration authority may impose conditions on registration, but may not impose conditions that are more onerous than would be imposed in similar circumstances (having regard to relevant qualifications and experience) if it were registration effected apart from this Part, unless they are conditions that apply to the person's registration in New Zealand or that are necessary to achieve equivalence of occupations.

    * (6) This section has effect subject to this Part.

##### 20  Action following notice

    * (1) Registration must be granted within one month after the notice is lodged with the local registration authority under section 18.

    * (2) When granted, registration takes effect as from the date the notice was lodged.

    * (3) However, the local registration authority may, subject to this Part and within one month after the notice was lodged, postpone or refuse the grant of registration.

    * (4) If the local registration authority neither grants the registration nor takes action under subsection (3) within the period of one month after the notice is lodged, the person is entitled to registration immediately at the end of that period and no objection may be taken to the notice on any of the grounds on which refusal or postponement may be effected, except where fraud is involved.

##### 21  Postponement of registration

    * (1) A local registration authority may postpone the grant of registration, if:

     * (a) any of the statements or information in the notice as required by section 18 are materially false or misleading; or 

     * (b) any document or information as required by section 18(3) has not been provided or is materially false or misleading; or 

     * (c) the circumstances of the person lodging the notice have materially changed since the date of the notice or the date it was lodged; or 

     * (d) the authority decides that the occupation in which registration is sought is not an equivalent occupation.

    * (2) If the grant of registration has been postponed, the local registration authority may in due course grant or refuse the registration.

    * (3) The local registration authority may not postpone the grant of registration for longer than a period of 6 months, and the person is entitled to registration immediately, at the end of that period, unless registration was refused at or before the end of that period.

    * (4) Nothing in subsection (3) prevents earlier registration from being granted on a review by the Australian Tribunal.

##### 22  Refusal of registration

    * (1) A local registration authority may refuse the grant of registration, if:

     * (a) any of the statements or information in the notice as required by section 18 are materially false or misleading; or 

     * (b) any document or information as required by section 18(3) has not been provided or is materially false or misleading; or 

     * (c) the authority decides that the occupation in which registration is sought is not an equivalent occupation and equivalence cannot be achieved by the imposition of conditions.

    * (2) A decision to refuse to grant registration on the ground that the occupation in which registration is sought is not an equivalent occupation takes effect at the end of a specified period (not less than 2 weeks) after the person is notified of the decision, unless it has been previously revoked or there is an application for review to the Australian Tribunal, in which case the Tribunal may make whatever orders it considers appropriate.

##### 23  Notification of decision 

    * A local registration authority must give the person who lodges a notice in accordance with section 18 a notice in writing of its decision to grant registration, or to postpone or refuse the grant of registration, or to impose conditions on registration.

#### Division 3--Interim arrangements

##### 24  Deemed registration

    * (1) A person who lodges a notice under section 18 with a local registration authority of an Australian jurisdiction is, pending the grant or refusal of registration, taken to be registered as provided in section 19.

    * (2) Such registration is called **_deemed registration_** in this Act.

    * (3) Deemed registration in one Australian jurisdiction does not of itself provide a basis for registration in another Australian jurisdiction.

##### 25  Duration of deemed registration

    * (1) A person's deemed registration in an Australian jurisdiction continues until it is cancelled or suspended or otherwise ceases in accordance with this Part.

    * (2) A person's deemed registration in an Australian jurisdiction ceases if the person becomes substantively registered in the jurisdiction in connection with the occupation concerned.

    * (3) A person's deemed registration in an Australian jurisdiction ceases if the local registration authority of the jurisdiction refuses to grant registration, subject to any determination of the Australian Tribunal.

    * (4) A person's deemed registration in an Australian jurisdiction ceases if the person ceases to be substantively registered in every other participating jurisdiction mentioned in the notice as required by section 18(2)(c).

    * (5) A local registration authority of an Australian jurisdiction may cancel a person's deemed registration in the jurisdiction if the person requests cancellation.

    * (6) Deemed registration is not affected by postponement of the grant of substantive registration.

##### 26  Activities under deemed registration

    * (1) A person who has deemed registration in an Australian jurisdiction may carry on the occupation in the jurisdiction as if the deemed registration were substantive registration in the jurisdiction.

    * (2) However, the person may do so only:

     * (a) within the limits conferred by the person's substantive registration in ; and

     * (b) within the limits conferred by the person's deemed registration in the Australian jurisdiction; and 

     * (c) subject to any conditions or undertakings applying to the person's registration in , unless waived by the local registration authority of the Australian jurisdiction under this section; and 

     * (d) subject to any conditions applying to the person's deemed registration.

    * (3) Without limiting anything in this Division:

    * The equivalence of occupations carried on in different participating jurisdictions is, for the purposes of this Act, to be determined in accordance with this Part.

##### 28  General principle

    * (1) An occupation for which persons may be registered in  is taken to be equivalent to an occupation for which persons may be registered in an Australian jurisdiction if the activities authorised to be carried out under each registration are substantially the same (whether or not this result is achieved by means of the imposition of conditions).

     * (a) the activities involved in the occupations are not substantially the same (even with the imposition of conditions); or

     * (b) registration in  should not entitle registered persons to carry on a particular activity or class of activity in an Australian jurisdiction, where:

     * (a) is cancelled or suspended; or

     * (b) is subject to a condition;

    * on disciplinary grounds, or as a result of or in anticipation of criminal, civil or disciplinary proceedings, then the person's registration in the equivalent occupation in an Australian jurisdiction is affected in the same way.
