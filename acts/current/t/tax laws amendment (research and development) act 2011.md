##### 3551  What this Division is about

     * An R&D entity may be entitled to a tax offset for R&D activities. The tax offset may be a refundable tax offset if the R&D entity's aggregated turnover is less than $20 million.

     * To be entitled to the tax offset, the R&D entity needs one or more notional deductions under this Division.

     * There are 2 main kinds of notional deductions. One is for expenditure on R&D activities. The other is for the decline in value of tangible depreciating assets used for R&D activities.

         * Note: All of these notional deductions require the R&D entity to be registered for the R&D activities under Part III of the _Industry Research and Development Act 1986_.

##### Subdivision 355A--Object

         * Note: Each of the above paragraphs extends to a body corporate acting in its capacity as trustee of a public trading trust (see subsection 102T(9) of the _Income Tax Assessment Act 1936_).

     * (2) A body corporate incorporated under a *foreign law that:

      * (a) is a resident of a foreign country for the purposes of an agreement in force between that country and Australia that:

     * (2) However, if the total of those amounts is less than $20,000, the *R&D entity is instead entitled to a *tax offset for the income year equal to that percentage of the total of the following kinds of expenditure (if any):

##### 355105  Deductions under this Division are notional only

     * An amount (the **_notional amount_**) that an *R&D entity can deduct under this Division is disregarded except for the purposes of:

      * (d) a provision (of this Act or any other Act) that includes an amount in assessable income wholly or partly because of the notional amount; and

          * Note: An example is Subdivision 20A, which may include in assessable income a recoupment of a loss or outgoing if the entity can deduct an amount for the loss or outgoing.

      * (e) a provision (of this Act or any other Act) that excludes expenditure from:

        * (i) the *cost base or *reduced cost base of a *CGT asset; or

         * Note: An activity can be covered by a finding under paragraph 28C(1)(a) of the _Industry Research and Development Act 1986_ if the activity cannot be conducted in Australia or the external Territories.

     * (2) However, an *R&D activity is not an activity to which this section applies if the activity is conducted, to a significant extent, for one or more other entities not covered by any paragraph of subsection (1).

         * Note: An entity would not be covered by, for example, paragraph (1)(c) if the conditions in section 355220 were not met for the R&D activity in relation to that entity.

##### 355215  R&D activities conducted by a permanent establishment for other parts of the body corporate

     * For the purposes of paragraph 355210(1)(b), the conditions for an *R&D activity are as follows:

      * (a) the R&D activity is conducted solely within Australia or an external Territory;

      * (b) if the R&D activity is a *supporting R&D activity, each corresponding *core R&D activity must be:

        * (i) an activity conducted, or to be conducted, solely within Australia or an external Territory; and

        * (ii) an activity for which the *R&D entity is or has been registered under section 27A of the _Industry Research and Development Act 1986_, or could be registered for an income year if that core R&D activity were conducted during the income year;

      * (c) there is written evidence that the R&D activity is conducted for the body corporate but not for the purposes of that permanent establishment.

         * Note: The body corporate is the R&D entity to the extent that it carries on business through that permanent establishment (see subsection 35535(2)).

##### 355220  R&D activities conducted for a foreign entity

     * (1) For the purposes of paragraph 355210(1)(c), the conditions for an *R&D activity conducted for one or more foreign residents are as follows:

      * (a) the R&D activity is conducted solely within Australia or an external Territory;

      * (b) if the R&D activity is a *supporting R&D activity, each corresponding *core R&D activity must be:

        * (i) an activity conducted, or to be conducted, solely within Australia or an external Territory; and

        * (ii) an activity for which the *R&D entity is or has been registered under section 27A of the _Industry Research and Development Act 1986_, or could be registered for an income year if that core R&D activity were conducted during the income year;

      * (c) when the R&D activity is conducted:

        * (i) each foreign resident is *connected with the R&D entity; or

        * (ii) for each foreign resident--either the foreign resident is an *affiliate of the R&D entity or the R&D entity is an affiliate of the foreign resident;

      * (d) the R&D activity is conducted:

        * (i) in accordance with a written agreement binding on only the R&D entity and each foreign resident; and

        * (ii) either directly by the R&D entity, or indirectly by another entity under an agreement binding on the R&D entity;

      * (e) the R&D activity is not conducted in connection with an agreement covered by subsection (2).

         * Note: An example of conducting an R&D activity indirectly under a contract is conducting the R&D activity under a subcontract, or one of a chain of subcontracts, under the contract.

     * (2) An agreement is covered by this subsection if:

      * (a) the agreement is binding on the R&D entity (the **_first entity_**) and an R&D entity that:

        * (i) is *connected with the first entity; or

        * (ii) has the first entity as an *affiliate, or is an affiliate of the first entity;

      * while the *R&D activity is conducted; and

      * (b) the R&D activity is to be conducted under the agreement by the first entity or by an entity:

        * (i) who is not bound by the agreement; and

        * (ii) who is to conduct the R&D activity directly or indirectly under another agreement to which the first entity is, or will become, bound.

         * Note: One effect of this subsection is that, even if the R&D entity has an agreement with the foreign resident for conducting the R&D activity, the R&D entity cannot deduct expenditure incurred:

          * (a) for conducting the R&D activity as a subcontractor under a subcontract with an affiliated R&D entity; or

          * (b) if the R&D entity is a subcontractor to an affiliated R&D entity--for further subcontracting the conducting of the R&D activity.

        * (i) to obtain new knowledge based on that technology; or

        * (ii) to create new or improved materials, products, devices, processes, techniques or services to be based on that technology; or

       * 355300	What this Subdivision is about

       * 355305	When notional deductions for decline in value arise

       * 355310	Notional application of Division 40

       * 355315	Balancing adjustments--assets only used for R&D activities

##### 355300  What this Subdivision is about

     * An R&D entity can notionally deduct the decline in value of a tangible depreciating asset used for R&D activities.

     * If a balancing adjustment event later happens for the asset, the R&D entity may be able to notionally deduct a further amount. Alternatively, an amount may be included in the R&D entity's assessable income.

##### 355305  When notional deductions for decline in value arise

     * (1) If:

      * (a) an *R&D entity is registered under section 27A of the _Industry Research and Development Act 1986_ for an income year (the **_present year_**) for one or more *R&D activities that are activities to which section 355210 (conditions for R&D activities) applies; and

      * (b) while a tangible *depreciating asset is *held by the R&D entity during the present year, the asset is used for the purpose of conducting one or more of those R&D activities; and

      * (c) the R&D entity could deduct an amount under section 4025 for the asset for the present year if Division 40 applied with the changes described in section 355310; and

      * (d) the R&D entity cannot deduct an amount for the asset for:

        * (i) an earlier income year under Subdivision 328D (capital allowances for small business entities); or

        * (ii) an earlier income year under Division 40 (as that Division applies apart from this Division), in a case where section 40440 (lowvalue pools) applied;

     * the R&D entity can deduct the amount referred to in paragraph (c) for the present year.

     * (2) This section has effect subject to subsection 355580(4) (CRC contributions).

##### 355310  Notional application of Division 40

     * (1) In addition to its application apart from this section, Division 40 also applies with the changes set out in this section for the purposes of:

      * (a) paragraph 355225(1)(b) (excluded expenditure); and

      * (b) paragraph 355305(1)(c); and

      * (c) section 355315 (balancing adjustments).

     * (2) Firstly, substitute the following for references to a *taxable purpose in Subdivisions 40A to 40D (other than for the purposes of sections 40100, 40105 and 40110):

         * Note: Sections 40100, 40105 and 40110 are about working out an asset's effective life. Those sections already refer to the use of the asset for R&D activities.

     * (3) Secondly, assume that Division 40 does not apply to a building, nor to an extension, alteration or improvement to a building, (the **_building works_**) for which the *R&D entity:

      * (a) can deduct amounts under Division 43 (capital works); or

      * (b) could deduct amounts under Division 43:

        * (i) apart from expenditure being incurred, or the building works being started, before a particular day; or

        * (ii) had the R&D entity used the building works for a purpose relevant to those building works under section 43140 (using an area in a deductible way).

     * (4) Finally, assume that the following provisions had not been enacted:

      * (a) subsection 4025(7) (meaning of taxable purpose);

      * (b) subsection 4045(2) (assets to which Division 40 does not apply);

      * (c) section 40425 (lowvalue pools);

      * (d) Subdivision 328D (capital allowances for small business entities).

         * Note: Subsection (3) and paragraph (4)(b) mean that deductions under section 355305 may be available for capital works other than building works.

##### 355315  Balancing adjustments--assets only used for R&D activities

     * (1) This section applies to an *R&D entity if:

      * (a) a *balancing adjustment event happens in an income year (the **_event year_**) for an asset *****held by the R&D entity; and

      * (b) the R&D entity cannot deduct an amount under section 4025, as that section applies apart from:

        * (i) this Division; and

        * (ii) former section 73BC of the _Income Tax Assessment Act 1936_;

      * for the asset for an income year; and

      * (c) the R&D entity is entitled under section 355100 to *tax offsets for one or more income years for deductions (the **_R&D deductions_**) under section 355305 for the asset; and

      * (d) the entity is registered under section 27A of the _Industry Research and Development Act 1986_ for one or more *R&D activities for the event year; and

      * (e) if Division 40 applied with the changes described in section 355310:

        * (i) the entity could deduct for the event year an amount under subsection 40285(2) for the asset and the balancing adjustment event; or

        * (ii) an amount would be included in the entity's assessable income for the event year under subsection 40285(1) for the asset and the balancing adjustment event.

         * Note 1: This section applies in a modified way if the entity also has deductions for the asset under former section 73BA or 73BH of the _Income Tax Assessment Act 1936_ (see section 355320 of the _Income Tax (Transitional Provisions) Act 1997_).

         * Note 2: Section 40292 applies if the entity can deduct an amount under section 4025, as that section applies apart from this Division and former section 73BC of the _Income Tax Assessment Act 1936_.

     * Notional deduction

     * (2) If the *R&D entity could deduct for the event year an amount under subsection 40285(2) for the asset and the event if Division 40 applied as described in paragraph (1)(e), the R&D entity can deduct that amount for the event year.

     * Amount to be included in assessable income

     * (3) If an amount (the **_section 40285 amount_**) would be included in the *R&D entity's assessable income for the event year under subsection 40285(1) for the asset and the event if Division 40 applied as described in paragraph (1)(e), the sum of that amount and the following amount is included in the R&D entity's assessable income for the event year:

     * where: 

     * **_adjusted section 40285 amount_** means so much of the section 40285 amount as does not exceed the total decline in value.

     * **_total decline in value_** means the asset's *cost, less its *adjustable value, worked out under Division 40 as it applies as described in paragraph (1)(e).

##### Subdivision 355F--Integrity Rules

##### Table of sections

       * 355400	Expenditure incurred while not at arm's length

       * 355405	Expenditure not at risk

       * 355410	Disposal of R&D results

       * 355415	Reducing deductions to reflect markups within groups

##### 355400  Expenditure incurred while not at arm's length

     * If: 

      * (a) an *R&D entity incurs expenditure to another entity on all or part of an *R&D activity; and

      * (b) either:

        * (i) when the R&D entity incurs the expenditure, the R&D entity and the other entity do not deal with each other at *arm's length; or

        * (ii) the other entity is the R&D entity's *associate; and

      * (c) the expenditure exceeds the *market value of the relevant R&D activity or part (as appropriate);

     * for the purposes of this Division, the R&D entity is treated as if the amount of expenditure it incurred on the relevant R&D activity or part (as appropriate) were equal to that market value.

         * Note 1: For the purposes of a deduction under section 355305 or 355520 for an asset's decline in value, the arms' length rules in Division 40 apply as part of the notional application of that Division under that section.

         * Note 2: In the application of Division 13 of Part III of the _Income Tax Assessment Act 1936_ (about international transferpricing arrangements), this section is disregarded (see subsection 136AB(2) of that Act).

##### 355405  Expenditure not at risk

     * (1) An *R&D entity cannot deduct expenditure under section 355205 or 355480 if:

      * (a) when it incurs the expenditure, the R&D entity or its *associate had received, or could reasonably be expected to receive, consideration:

        * (i) as a direct or indirect result of the expenditure being incurred; and

        * (ii) regardless of the results of the activities on which the expenditure is incurred; and

      * (b) that consideration is equal to or greater than the expenditure.

         * Note: Section 355205 is about deductions for R&D expenditure. Section 355480 is about deductions for earlier year associate R&D expenditure.

     * (2) If:

      * (a) when an *R&D entity incurs expenditure, the R&D entity or its *associate had received, or could reasonably be expected to receive, consideration:

        * (i) as a direct or indirect result of the expenditure being incurred; and

        * (ii) regardless of the results of the activities on which the expenditure is incurred; and

      * (b) that consideration is less than the expenditure;

     * the R&D entity cannot deduct under section 355205 or 355480 so much of the expenditure as is equal to the consideration.

     * (3) For the purposes of paragraphs (1)(a) and (2)(a), have regard to:

      * (a) anything that happened or existed before or at the time the expenditure is incurred; and

      * (b) anything that is likely to happen or exist after that time.

     * (4) This section does not apply to expenditure incurred on *R&D activities covered by paragraph 355210(1)(b) or (c).

         * Note: Those paragraphs cover R&D activities conducted for foreign residents.

##### 355410  Disposal of R&D results

     * (1) This section applies to an *R&D entity if:

      * (a) the R&D entity is entitled under section 355100 to a *tax offset because it can:

        * (i) deduct under section 355205 or 355480 expenditure incurred on *R&D activities; or

        * (ii) deduct under section 355305 or 355520 an amount for an asset (the **_R&D asset_**) used for the purpose of conducting one or more R&D activities; and

      * (b) the R&D entity receives or becomes entitled to receive one or more of the following amounts (the **_results amounts_**) in an income year (the **_results year_**):

        * (i) an amount for the results of any of the R&D activities;

        * (ii) an amount from granting access to, or the right to use, any of those results;

        * (iii) an amount attributable to the R&D entity having incurred the expenditure, including an amount it is entitled to receive regardless of the results of the R&D activities;

        * (iv) an amount attributable to the R&D asset being used for the purpose mentioned in subparagraph (a)(ii), including an amount the R&D entity is entitled to receive regardless of the results of the R&D activities;

        * (v) an amount from *disposing of a *CGT asset, or from granting a right to occupy or use a CGT asset, where the disposal or grant resulted in another person acquiring a right to access or use any of those results.

         * Note: This section also applies with changes to the partners of an R&D partnership (see section 355535).

     * (2) For each results amount, the following amount is included in the *R&D entity's assessable income for the results year:

      * (a) if the results amount is only a results amount because of subparagraph (1)(b)(v), and the asset referred to in that subparagraph is a *depreciating asset--an amount equal to the extent (if any) that the results amount exceeds the asset's *cost just before the disposal or grant;

      * (b) if the results amount is only a results amount because of subparagraph (1)(b)(v), and the asset referred to in that subparagraph is not a depreciating asset--an amount equal to the extent (if any) that the results amount exceeds the asset's *cost base just before the disposal or grant;

      * (c) otherwise--the results amount.

     * (3) For the purposes of paragraph (2)(a), assume that subsection 4045(2) did not, except in the case of buildings and extensions, alterations and improvements to buildings, prevent Division 40 from applying to certain capital works.

##### 355415  Reducing deductions to reflect markups within groups

     * (1) This section applies to an *R&D entity if:

      * (a) the R&D entity can deduct an amount under section 355205 or 355480 for an income year for one or more *R&D activities; and

      * (b) one or more other entities (the **_grouped entities_**) incurred expenditure during the income year, or an earlier income year, on one or more of those *R&D activities; and

      * (c) when each grouped entity incurred the expenditure:

        * (i) the grouped entity was *connected with the R&D entity; or

        * (ii) the grouped entity was an *affiliate of the R&D entity or the R&D entity was an affiliate of the grouped entity.

         * Note: Section 355205 is about deductions for R&D expenditure. Section 355480 is about deductions for earlier year associate R&D expenditure.

     * Reducing deductions by group markups

     * (2) The amount the *R&D entity can deduct, apart from this section, under section 355205 or 355480 for the income year is reduced by the amount (the **_reduction amount_**) worked out as follows:

Method statement

        * Step 1.	For each grouped entity, work out the sum of the amounts derived during the income year, or an earlier income year, by the grouped entity for goods or services relating to one or more of the *R&D activities while:

         * (a) the grouped entity was *connected with the *R&D entity; or

         * (b) the grouped entity was an *affiliate of the R&D entity or the R&D entity was an affiliate of the grouped entity.

        * Step 2.	From the sum of those amounts, subtract the actual cost to each grouped entity of providing the goods or services that correspond to those amounts.

     * If R&D entity has deductions for both R&D expenditure and earlier year associate R&D expenditure

     * (3) However, if the *R&D entity can deduct amounts under both sections 355205 and 355480 for the income year, those amounts are reduced as follows:

      * (a) apply the reduction amount to reduce the amount otherwise deductible under section 355205 (but not below zero); and

      * (b) then apply any remainder of the reduction amount to reduce the amount otherwise deductible under section 355480 (but not below zero).

     * Disregard markups already taken into account

     * (4) For the purposes of step 1 of the method statement in subsection (2), disregard any of the amounts from that step that have already been taken into account under this section for the *R&D entity and the *R&D activities for an earlier income year.

##### Table of sections

       * 355480	Notional deductions for expenditure incurred to associate in earlier income years

##### 355480  Notional deductions for expenditure incurred to associate in earlier income years

     * Notional deductions for earlier year associate expenditure

     * (1) An *R&D entity can deduct for an income year (the **_present year_**) expenditure it incurred to its *associate during an earlier income year to the extent that:

      * (a) the expenditure was incurred on one or more *R&D activities:

        * (i) for which the R&D entity is registered under section 27A of the _Industry Research and Development Act 1986_ for an income year; and

        * (ii) that are activities to which section 355210 (conditions for R&D activities) applies; and

      * (b) the expenditure is paid to that associate during the present year; and

      * (c) subsection (2) applies to the expenditure.

         * Note 1: This section applies in a modified way to R&D partnership expenditure (see sections 355510 and 355515).

         * Note 2: Expenditure paid in income years starting on or after 1 July 2011 may be deductible for activities registered for income years starting before 1 July 2011 (see section 355200 of the _Income Tax (Transitional Provisions) Act 1997_).

     * Expenditure cannot have been otherwise deducted etc.

     * (2) This subsection applies to the expenditure if:

      * (a) the *R&D entity can deduct the expenditure, or is entitled to a *tax offset for the expenditure, under any other Division of this Act for an earlier income year; and

      * (b) by the time of lodging its *income tax return for the most recent income year before the present year, the R&D entity had neither:

        * (i) deducted the expenditure; nor

        * (ii) obtained a tax offset for the expenditure;

      * as described in paragraph (a).

     * (3) The entitlement to the deduction, or *tax offset, described in paragraph (2)(a) ceases to the extent that subsection (2) applies to the expenditure.

         * Example: If, by the time mentioned in paragraph (2)(b), an R&D entity chose to deduct only a third of the expenditure it could have deducted under another Division, then the remaining 2 thirds of that expenditure:

          * (a) can be deducted under this section; but

          * (b) can no longer be deducted under the other Division.

     * Notional deduction is subject to integrity rules etc.

     * (4) This section has effect subject to section 355225 (excluded expenditure), Subdivision 355F (integrity rules) and subsection 355580(3) (CRC contributions).

     * In particular, the rules about deducting R&D expenditure are modified to allow a partner to deduct the partner's proportion of the R&D partnership's expenditure on R&D activities.

     * A partner of an R&D partnership may also be able to deduct under this Subdivision the decline in value of partnership assets used for R&D activities.

##### 355505  Meaning of R&D partnership and partner's proportion

     * (1) A partnership is an **_R&D partnership_** at a particular time if, at that time, each of the partners is an *R&D entity.

     * (2) For an amount attributable to an *R&D partnership for an income year, each partner of the R&D partnership is taken to bear or be entitled to (as appropriate) this proportion (the **_partner's proportion_**) of the amount:

      * (a) the proportion the partners agreed the partner should bear or be entitled to (as appropriate); or

      * (b) if there is no such agreement--the proportion of the partner's interest in the *net income or *partnership loss of the R&D partnership for the income year.

##### 355510  R&D partnership expenditure on R&D activities

     * If an *R&D partnership incurs expenditure on one or more R&D activities during an income year, this Division applies in relation to each *R&D entity that is a partner of the R&D partnership at some time during the income year as if:

      * (a) the partner incurred the partner's proportion of that expenditure when the R&D partnership incurred that expenditure; and

      * (b) neither the R&D partnership, nor any other partner of the R&D partnership, incurred expenditure during the income year on the R&D activities; and

      * (c) such other changes were made to this Division as are appropriate having regard to that partner's proportion of amounts attributable to the R&D partnership.

         * Note: This section and section 355515 may result in:

          * (a) the partner being able to deduct the partner's proportion of the partnership expenditure under section 355205 (R&D expenditure) or 355480 (earlier year associate R&D expenditure) for the R&D activities; and

          * (b) the partner being affected by the integrity rules in Subdivisions 355F, 355G and 355H.

##### 355515  R&D activities conducted by or for an R&D partnership

     * If one or more *R&D activities are conducted by or for an *R&D partnership during an income year, this Division applies in relation to each *R&D entity that is a partner of the R&D partnership at some time during the income year as if:

      * (a) the R&D activities were conducted by or for the partner in a corresponding way to the way the R&D activities were conducted by or for the R&D partnership; and

      * (b) the partner had relationships with other entities in relation to the R&D activities that corresponded to the relationships the R&D partnership had with those other entities in relation to the R&D activities; and

      * (c) a thing done by, or in relation to, the R&D partnership in relation to the R&D activities were a thing done by, or in relation to, the partner; and

      * (d) the R&D activities were neither:

        * (i) conducted by or for the R&D partnership; nor

        * (ii) conducted by or for any other partner of the R&D partnership; and

      * (e) such other changes were made to this Division as are appropriate having regard to that partner's proportion of amounts attributable to the R&D partnership.

         * Note 1: For the purposes of this Division, entities that are associates or affiliates of, or connected with, the R&D partnership are taken to be associates or affiliates of, or connected with, the partner (see paragraph (b)).

         * Note 2: For the purposes of this Division, payments and agreements made by the R&D partnership for the R&D activities are taken to be made by the partner (see paragraph (c)).

##### 355520  When notional deductions arise for decline in value of depreciating assets of R&D partnerships

     * When notional deductions arise

     * (1) If:

      * (a) an *R&D entity is a partner of an *R&D partnership at some time during an income year (the **_present year_**); and

      * (b) the partner is registered under section 27A of the _Industry Research and Development Act 1986 _for the present year for one or more *R&D activities that are activities to which section 355210 (conditions for R&D activities) applies; and

          * Note: Section 355210 applies with changes for this paragraph (see section 355515).

      * (c) while a tangible *depreciating asset is *held by the R&D partnership during the present year, the asset is used for the purpose of conducting one or more of those R&D activities; and

      * (d) the R&D partnership could deduct an amount under section 4025 for the asset for the present year if Division 40 applied with the changes described in section 355310; and

          * Note: Section 355310 applies with changes for this paragraph (see subsection (2) of this section).

      * (e) the R&D partnership cannot deduct an amount for the asset for:

        * (i) an earlier income year under Subdivision 328D (capital allowances for small business entities); or

        * (ii) an earlier income year under Division 40 (as that Division applies apart from this Division), in a case where section 40440 (lowvalue pools) applied;

     * the partner can deduct the partner's proportion of the amount referred to in paragraph (d) for the present year.

     * Changed application of Division 40 for this Subdivision

     * (2) For the purposes of this Subdivision, section 355310 applies as if the following changes were made:

     * Disregard certain assets held because of CRC contributions

     * (3) This section has effect subject to subsection 355580(4) (CRC contributions).

##### 355525  Balancing adjustments for R&D partnership assets only used for R&D activities

     * (1) This section applies to an *R&D entity (the **_partner_**) if:

      * (a) a *balancing adjustment event happens in an income year (the **_event year_**) for an asset *****held by an *R&D partnership; and

      * (b) the R&D partnership cannot deduct an amount under section 4025, as that section applies apart from:

        * (i) this Division; and

        * (ii) former section 73BC of the _Income Tax Assessment Act 1936_;

      * for the asset for an income year; and

      * (c) the partner is entitled under section 355100 to *tax offsets for one or more income years for deductions (the **_R&D deductions_**) under section 355520 for the asset; and

      * (d) the partner is registered under section 27A of the _Industry Research and Development Act 1986_ for one or more *R&D activities for the event year; and

      * (e) if Division 40 applied with the changes described in section 355310 (as affected by subsection 355520(2)):

        * (i) the R&D partnership could deduct for the event year an amount under subsection 40285(2) for the asset and the balancing adjustment event; or

        * (ii) an amount would be included in the R&D partnership's assessable income for the event year under subsection 40285(1) for the asset and the balancing adjustment event.

         * Note 1: This section applies in a modified way if the partner has deductions for the asset under former section 73BA or 73BH of the _Income Tax Assessment Act 1936_ (see section 355325 of the _Income Tax (Transitional Provisions) Act 1997_).

         * Note 2: Section 40293 applies if the R&D partnership can deduct an amount under section 4025, as that section applies apart from this Division and former section 73BC of the _Income Tax Assessment Act 1936_.

     * Notional deduction

     * (2) If the *R&D partnership could deduct for the event year an amount under subsection 40285(2) for the asset and the event if Division 40 applied as described in paragraph (1)(e), the partner can deduct the partner's proportion of that amount for the event year.

     * Amount to be included in assessable income

     * (3) If an amount (the **_section 40285 amount_**) would be included in the *R&D partnership's assessable income for the event year under subsection 40285(1) for the asset and the event if Division 40 applied as described in paragraph (1)(e), the partner's proportion of the sum of:

      * (a) that amount; and

      * (b) the following amount;

     * is included in the partner's assessable income for the event year:

     * where: 

     * **_adjusted section 40285 amount_** means so much of the section 40285 amount as does not exceed the total decline in value.

     * **_total decline in value_** means the asset's *cost, less its *adjustable value, worked out under Division 40 as it applies as described in paragraph (1)(e).

##### 355530  Implications for partner's aggregated turnover

     * For the purposes of sections 40292 (balancing adjustments for decline in value) and 355100 (tax offsets for R&D), if:

      * (a) an *R&D entity is a partner of an *R&D partnership at some time during an income year; and

      * (b) the partner's *aggregated turnover for the income year does not include the R&D partnership's *annual turnover for the income year;

     * the partner's aggregated turnover for the income year includes the *partner's proportion of the R&D partnership's annual turnover for the income year.

##### 355535  Disposal of R&D results for R&D partnerships

     * In addition to its application apart from this section, section 355410 (disposal of R&D results) also applies to each partner of an *R&D partnership with such changes as are appropriate having regard to:

      * (a) amounts (the **_results amounts_**) of a kind set out in subparagraphs 355410(1)(b)(i) to (v) that the R&D partnership receives or becomes entitled to receive in an income year; and

      * (b) the principle that any amount to be included in the partner's assessable income for the income year for a results amount should be the partner's proportion of the amount arising under subsection 355410(2) for the results amount.

         * Note: The ordinary application of section 355410 will apply to any of the partner's deductions under this Division that do not relate to the R&D partnership.

##### 355540  Application of recoupment rules

     * (1) If:

      * (a) an *R&D partnership incurs expenditure (the **_partnership expenditure_**) on *R&D activities; and

      * (b) an *R&D entity (the **_partner_**) is entitled under section 355100 to a *tax offset because it can, under section 355205 or 355480, deduct some or all of that expenditure; and

      * (c) the R&D partnership receives an amount as a *recoupment of any or all of the partnership expenditure;

     * the partner is taken, for the purposes of Subdivisions 20A and 355G:

      * (d) to have incurred the partner's proportion of the partnership expenditure when the R&D partnership incurred that expenditure; and

      * (e) to have received the partner's proportion of the recoupment when the R&D partnership received the recoupment.

     * (2) If:

      * (a) an *R&D entity (the **_partner_**) is entitled under section 355100 to a *tax offset because it can, under section 355520, deduct an amount for an income year for an asset; and

      * (b) the applicable *R&D partnership receives an amount as a *recoupment of any or all of the R&D partnership's expenditure included in the *cost of the asset for the purposes of the application of Division 40 as described in paragraph 355520(1)(d);

     * the partner is taken, for the purposes of Subdivisions 20A and 355G:

      * (c) to have incurred the partner's proportion of that expenditure when the R&D partnership incurred that expenditure; and

      * (d) to have received the partner's proportion of the recoupment when the R&D partnership received the recoupment.

##### 355545  Relevance for net income, and losses, of the R&D partnership

     * For an *R&D entity that is a partner of an *R&D partnership, none of the following:

      * (a) any expenditure the R&D entity is taken to have incurred because of this Subdivision;

      * (b) any amount the R&D entity can deduct under this Subdivision;

      * (c) any *recoupment the R&D entity is taken to have received because of this Subdivision;

     * are to be taken into account in determining the *net income of the R&D partnership, or any *partnership loss of the R&D partnership, for an income year.

       * 355580	When notional deductions for CRC contributions arise

##### 355580  When notional deductions for CRC contributions arise

     * Monetary contributions are deductible

     * (1) An *R&D entity can deduct for an income year expenditure it incurs during that year to the extent that:

      * (a) the expenditure is in the form of monetary contributions under the *CRC program; and

      * (b) the contributions have been or will be spent under the CRC program on one or more *R&D activities for which the R&D entity is registered under section 27A of the _Industry Research and Development Act 1986_ for an income year.

         * Note 1: The R&D activities will need to be conducted during the income year the R&D entity is registered for those activities (see sections 27A and 27J of the _Industry Research and Development Act 1986_).

         * Note 2: Expenditure incurred in income years starting on or after 1 July 2011 may be deductible for activities registered for income years starting before 1 July 2011 (see section 355200 of the _Income Tax (Transitional Provisions) Act 1997_).

     * (2) Subsection (1) does not apply to expenditure to the extent that it is incurred out of Commonwealth funding.

     * No other deductions arise for monetary contributions etc.

     * (3) Neither:

      * (a) a contribution an *R&D entity can deduct under subsection (1); nor

      * (b) expenditure incurred under the *CRC program, to the extent that the expenditure is incurred out of:

        * (i) a contribution an R&D entity can deduct under subsection (1); or

        * (ii) Commonwealth funding;

     * can be deducted by any R&D entity under any other provision of this Division for any income year.

     * (4) If an asset's *cost includes expenditure incurred under the *CRC program out of:

      * (a) a contribution an *R&D entity can deduct under subsection (1); or

      * (b) Commonwealth funding;

     * an amount equal to the asset's decline in value cannot be deducted under this Division by any R&D entity for any income year.

       * 355710	Amendment of assessments

       * 355715	Implications for other deductions and tax offsets

##### 355700  Objecting to assessment of refundable tax offset

     * (1) An *R&D entity may object under subsection 175A(1) of the _Income Tax Assessment Act 1936_ against an assessment made in relation to the R&D entity to the extent that the assessment relates to the amount of a *tax offset under section 355100 that is subject to the refundable tax offset rules.

         * Note: See section 6730 for when a tax offset under section 355100 is subject to the refundable tax offset rules.

     * (2) This section does not limit subsection 175A(1) of that Act, and has effect despite subsection 175A(2) of that Act.

         * Note: Subsection 175A(2) of that Act prevents objections if the taxpayer has no taxable income, or if there is no tax payable on the taxpayer's taxable income.

##### 355705  Effect of findings by Innovation Australia

     * Findings about registration or core technology

     * (1) If:

      * (a) a certificate given to the Commissioner under the _Industry Research and Development Act 1986_ sets out:

        * (i) a finding under section 27B of that Act about an *R&D entity's application for registration under section 27A of that Act for an income year; or

        * (ii) a finding under section 27J of that Act about an R&D entity's registration under section 27A of that Act for an income year; or

        * (iii) a finding under section 28E of that Act about an R&D entity and one or more *R&D activities conducted or to be conducted during one or more income years; and

      * (b) the finding was made within 4 years after the end of the income year or the last of the income years (as appropriate);

     * the finding binds the Commissioner for the purposes of assessments of the R&D entity for the income year or years (as appropriate).

         * Note: Section 28E of the _Industry Research and Development Act 1986_ deals with findings that technology is core technology for particular R&D activities. Expenditure incurred in acquiring such technology is not deductible under this Division (see subsection 355225(2)).

     * Advance findings about activities yet to be completed

     * (2) If:

      * (a) an activity is being conducted, or is yet to be conducted, in an income year; and

      * (b) an *R&D entity applies in the income year for a finding under section 28A of the _Industry Research and Development Act 1986_ about the activity; and

      * (c) Innovation Australia makes the finding and gives the Commissioner a certificate under that Act setting out the finding;

     * the finding binds the Commissioner for the purposes of assessments of the R&D entity for the income year and the next 2 income years.

     * Advance findings about completed activities

     * (3) However, if:

      * (a) an activity is completed during an income year; and

      * (b) an *R&D entity applies in the income year for a finding under section 28A of the _Industry Research and Development Act 1986_ about the activity; and

      * (c) Innovation Australia makes the finding and gives the Commissioner a certificate under that Act setting out the finding;

     * the finding binds the Commissioner for the purposes of assessments of the R&D entity for the income year.

##### 355710  Amendment of assessments

     * Dealing with findings of Innovation Australia

     * (1) If:

      * (a) a certificate given to the Commissioner under the _Industry Research and Development Act 1986_ sets out:

        * (i) a finding under section 27B of that Act about an *R&D entity's application for registration under section 27A of that Act for an income year; or

        * (ii) a finding under section 27J of that Act about an R&D entity's registration under section 27A of that Act for an income year; or

        * (iii) a finding under section 28A or 28C of that Act made on application by an R&D entity during an income year; or

        * (iv) a finding under section 28E of that Act about an R&D entity and one or more R&D activities conducted or to be conducted during one or more income years; and

      * (b) the finding was made within 4 years after the end of the income year or the last of the income years (as appropriate);

     * despite section 170 of the _Income Tax Assessment Act 1936_, the Commissioner may amend the R&D entity's assessment for an income year affected by the finding at any time for the purposes of giving effect to the finding.

     * (2) However, the Commissioner may only do so within 2 years after the Commissioner is given the certificate if giving effect to the finding would increase the R&D entity's liability.

     * Dealing with key decisions of Innovation Australia and others

     * (3) If:

      * (a) an internal review decision (the **_key decision_**) under subsection 30D(2) of the _Industry Research and Development Act 1986_ relates to an *R&D entity; or

      * (b) a decision (also the **_key decision_**) under the _Administrative Appeals Tribunal Act 1975_:

        * (i) varies a decision covered by paragraph (a); or

        * (ii) sets aside a decision covered by paragraph (a), whether or not that key decision also includes a decision made in substitution for the decision covered by paragraph (a); or

      * (c) a decision (also the **_key decision_**) of a court is about:

        * (i) a decision under Part III of the _Industry Research and Development Act 1986_ relating to an R&D entity; or

        * (ii) a decision covered by paragraph (b);

     * despite section 170 of the _Income Tax Assessment Act 1936_, the Commissioner may amend the R&D entity's assessment for an income year affected by the key decision at any time for the purposes of giving effect to that decision.

##### 355715  Implications for other deductions and tax offsets

     * (1) If an *R&D entity is entitled under section 355100 to a *tax offset for an income year for expenditure it can deduct under section 355205, 355480 or 355580, that expenditure:

      * (a) cannot be taken into account by any entity in working out a deduction under any other Division of this Act for any income year; and

      * (b) cannot be taken into account by any entity in working out a tax offset under any other Division of this Act for any income year.

         * Note: Section 355205 is about R&D expenditure, section 355480 is about earlier year associate R&D expenditure, and section 355580 is about CRC contributions.

     * (2) If an *R&D entity is entitled under section 355100 to a *tax offset for an income year for a deduction under section 355305, 355315, 355520 or 355525 of an amount equal to the decline in value of an asset, that decline in value:

      * (a) cannot be taken into account by any entity in working out a deduction under any other Division of this Act (other than section 40292 or 40293) for any income year; and

      * (b) cannot be taken into account by any entity in working out a tax offset under any other Division of this Act for any income year;

     * to the extent that the decline in value is attributable to the use of the asset for the purpose of conducting one or more of the *R&D activities to which the deduction relates.

         * Note 1: A deduction may be available under section 4025 to the extent that the asset's decline in value is attributable to another purpose. If so, that deduction under section 4025 will not take into account the asset's decline in value to the extent that it is attributable to the R&D activities (see also subsection 4025(2)).

         * Note 2: Section 355305 is about the decline in value of R&D assets, section 355315 is about balancing adjustments for R&D assets, section 355520 is about the decline in value of R&D partnership assets, and section 355525 is about balancing adjustments for R&D partnership assets.

         * Note 3: Sections 40292 and 40293 deal with balancing adjustments when deductions have been available for the asset's decline in value both under this Division and section 4025.

### Part III--Functions relating to the R&D tax offset

#### Division 1--Introduction

##### 26  Objects

     * The objects of this Part are: 

      * (a) to provide integrity for the working out of tax offsets under Division 355 (about R&D) of the _Income Tax Assessment Act 1997_; and

      * (b) to increase certainty through findings about matters relevant to the working out of those tax offsets; and

      * (c) to improve access for small and medium R&D entities to quality research services by maintaining a register of research service providers.

         * Note: The integrity mentioned in paragraph (a) is provided, for example, by:

          * (a) the Board registering entities seeking these tax offsets; and

          * (b) the Board conducting compliance checks on those entities.

##### 26A  Simplified outline

     * The following is a simplified outline of this Part: 

      *  	The Board may, on application by an R&D entity, register the R&D entity for R&D activities. This registration is needed before the R&D entity can be entitled to a tax offset (an **_R&D tax offset_**) under Division 355 of the _Income Tax Assessment Act 1997_ for the R&D activities.

      *  	The R&D entity can seek an advance finding to get early notice about whether an activity is considered to be an R&D activity.

      *  	The R&D entity can seek a finding that an activity cannot be conducted in Australia. The finding is needed before expenditure incurred on the activity can count towards an R&D tax offset.

      *  	The Board may register entities as research service providers capable of providing research services to R&D entities.

      *  	Internal and external review can be sought for certain decisions under this Part.

#### Division 2--Registering for the R&D tax offset

##### Subdivision A--Introduction

##### 27  Simplified outline

     * The following is a simplified outline of this Division: 

      *  	The Board may register an R&D entity for R&D activities conducted during an income year.

      *  	The Board may make findings about the nature of an R&D entity's activities both before and after registration. This includes findings made on application by the R&D entity after registration.

      *  	These findings bind the Commissioner for the purposes of any entitlement of the R&D entity to a tax offset under Division 355 of the _Income Tax Assessment Act 1997_ for the activities.

      * (a) the overseas activity; and

      * (b) each other activity (if any) conducted wholly or partly outside Australia and the external Territories that has a significant scientific link to the Australian core activities;

     * is less than the total actual and reasonably anticipated expenditure of any entity in all income years on: 

      * (c) the Australian core activities; and

         * Note 1: A finding, or a refusal to make a finding, is reviewable (see Division 5).

         * Note 2: A finding under paragraph (a) means that a tax offset will not be available for expenditure incurred in acquiring, or in acquiring the right to use, the technology for the R&D activities (see subsection 355225(2) of the _Income Tax Assessment Act 1997_).

         * Note 3: Section 32A deals with the decisionmaking principles.

      * (a) confirming the reviewable decision; or

      * (b) varying the reviewable decision; or

      * (c) setting aside the reviewable decision and substituting a new decision.

         * Note: An internal review decision is reviewable by the Administrative Appeals Tribunal (see section 30E). Under the _Administrative Appeals Tribunal Act 1975_, notice of the internal review decision must be given to any person whose interests are affected by the decision.

     * Deemed internal review decisions

     * (3) If the Board does not make a decision under subsection (2) before the end of the period of 90 days after the day on which the Board received the application for review, the Board is taken, at the end of that period, to have made a decision (also an **_internal review decision_**) confirming the reviewable decision.

      * (b) a decision made by the Tribunal under that section in substitution for an internal review decision.

         * Note: This means that the varied or substituted decision takes effect from the day on which the reviewable decision took effect (see subsection 30D(5)).

     * (3) If an internal review decision is taken to be made under subsection 30D(3), section 29 of the _Administrative Appeals Tribunal Act 1975_ applies as if:

#### Division 6--Consolidated groups and MEC groups

##### 31  Registrations and findings not effective for subsidiary members for group R&D activities

     * (1) An R&D entity's registration under section 27A for an income year has no effect to the extent that the registration is for an activity conducted during a period that the R&D entity is a subsidiary member of a consolidated group or MEC group, of which the head company is an R&D entity.

         * Example: If an activity is conducted by the R&D entity during all of an income year, and part way through the income year the R&D entity becomes a subsidiary member of a consolidated group:

          * (a) the R&D entity can apply to be registered for the activity for the income year, and that registration will be effective in respect of the first part of the income year; and

          * (b) the head company of the group can apply to be registered for the activity for the income year in respect of the second part of the income year.

     * (2) If:

      * (a) a finding is made under this Part on application by an R&D entity that is a subsidiary member of a consolidated group or MEC group; and

      * (b) the head company of the group is also an R&D entity;

     * the finding has no effect to the extent that the finding is for an activity conducted during a period that the R&D entity is a subsidiary member of the group.

##### 31A  What happens to findings if R&D entity joins a group

     * (1) If a finding (the **_actual finding_**) under this Part:

      * (a) is in force for an R&D entity immediately before the time (the **_joining time_**) it becomes a subsidiary member of a consolidated group or MEC group, of which the head company is an R&D entity; and

      * (b) is for an activity to be conducted wholly or partly after the joining time;

     * a corresponding finding (the **_deemed finding_**) in the same terms is taken to come into force at the joining time for the head company and the activity.

     * (2) The deemed finding ceases to be in force if the R&D entity ceases to be a subsidiary member of the group.

     * (3) The result of any review (see Division 5) of an actual finding is taken to apply in a corresponding way to the deemed finding.

     * (4) Neither section 28F (notice of decision about findings) nor Division 5 (review) applies to the deemed finding.

##### 31B  What happens to findings if R&D entity leaves a group

     * (1) The consequences in subsection (2) apply if a finding (the **_group finding_**) under this Part:

      * (a) is for an R&D entity that is the head company of a consolidated group or MEC group; and

      * (b) is in force immediately before the time (the **_leaving time_**) another R&D entity ceases to be a subsidiary member of the group; and

      * (c) is for an activity to be conducted by or for the other R&D entity wholly or partly after the leaving time; and

      * (d) is not a deemed finding.

     * (2) The consequences are as follows:

      * (a) a corresponding finding (the **_continuing finding_**) in the same terms is taken to come into force at the leaving time for the other R&D entity and the activity;

      * (b) everything that happened under this Part before the leaving time in relation to the group finding is taken to have happened in relation to the continuing finding;

      * (c) the group finding ceases to be in force at the leaving time.

     * (2) To be in the approved form for the provision, the thing must:

      * (a) be in writing in a form approved by the Board; and

      * (b) include the information required by the form; and

      * (c) include any other material (including documents) required by the form.

     * (3) The Board may approve, in writing, a form for the purposes of paragraph (2)(a). When doing so, the Board must ensure the form requires the production of information, or other material (including documents), specified in regulations made for the purposes of this subsection.

      * (b) whether refusing to make a finding sought under this Part is justified;

      * (c) whether making a variation sought under section 27M is justified.

##### 32B  General rules about findings under this Part

     * (1) A finding made under this Part in relation to an R&D entity has no effect to the extent of any inconsistency with a finding already in force under this Part in relation to the R&D entity.

         * Example: A finding under subsection 27J(1) in relation to an R&D entity's registration has no effect to the extent of any inconsistency with:

          * (a) a finding already in force under that subsection in relation to that registration; or

          * (b) a finding already in force under subsection 27B(1) in relation to the application for that registration; or

          * (c) a finding already in force under subsection 28A(1) (advance findings about the nature of activities) in relation to the R&D entity.

     * (2) Subsection 33(3) of the _Acts Interpretation Act 1901_ does not apply to the power to make a finding under this Part.

         * Note: This means the power to make a finding does not itself include the power to vary or revoke that finding. A finding can only be varied or revoked on review under Division 5.

      * (a) a *taxable purpose;

      * (b) the purpose of producing *exempt income or *nonassessable nonexempt income;

      * (b) assume the asset will be maintained in reasonably good order and condition; and

      * (c) have regard to the period within which the asset is likely to be scrapped, sold for no more than scrap value or abandoned.

      * (b) assume that the asset will be maintained in reasonably good order and condition.

     * (2) If, in working out that period, you decide that the asset would be likely to be:

      * (a) scrapped; or

      * (b) sold for no more than scrap value or abandoned;

     * before the end of that period, its **_effective life_** ends at the earlier time. However, when making your decision, disregard reasons attributable to the technical risk in conducting *R&D activities if it is reasonably likely that the asset will be used for such activities.

     * Section 40290 to be applied as if use for conducting R&D activities were use for a taxable purpose

     * (2) In applying section 40290 (including references in that section to the reduction of deductions under section 4025) in relation to the asset, assume that using the asset for a *taxable purpose includes using it for the purpose of conducting the *R&D activities to which the R&D deductions relate.

     * Increase in amounts deductible or assessable under section 40285

     * (3) Any amount (the **_section 40285 amount_**):

### Schedule 3A--Quarterly credits

#### Part 1--Introduction

##### 1  Definitions

   * (1) In this Schedule:

   * **_net refund assessment position_**: an entity is in a **_net refund assessment position_** for an income year if:

      * (a) an excess remains after the entity's tax offsets for the income year are applied against its basic income tax liability for the income year; and

      * (b) that excess is wholly or partly refundable.

   * Note: The excess will be wholly or partly refundable if some or all of the tax offsets are refundable tax offsets.

   * **_quarterly credit_** means a credit referred to in item 3.

   * **_refundable R&D tax offset_**: an entity is entitled to a **_refundable R&D tax offset_** for an income year if:

      * (a) the entity is an R&D entity that is entitled under section 355100 of the _Income Tax Assessment Act 1997 _to a tax offset for the income year; and

      * (b) that tax offset is a refundable tax offset.

   * **_refundable tax offset_** means a tax offset that is subject to the refundable tax offset rules.

   * **_relevant Acts_** means the following Acts:

      * (a) the _Income Tax Assessment Act 1936_;

      * (b) the _Income Tax Assessment Act 1997_;

      * (c) the _Industry Research and Development Act 1986_;

      * (d) the _Taxation Administration Act 1953._

   * _**_total credits_**: an entity's **_total credits_** for an income year is an amount equal to the sum of the entity's quarterly credits for the income year.

   * (2) Subject to subitem (1), an expression used in this Schedule that is also used in the _Income Tax Assessment Act 1997_ has the same meaning in this Schedule as it has in that Act.

#### Part 2--Power to make regulations to modify operation of Acts

##### 2  Regulations may modify operation of Acts to allow quarterly credits

   * (1) The GovernorGeneral may make regulations modifying the operation of one or more of the relevant Acts for the purpose of achieving the objectives set out in this Part. The regulations have effect accordingly.

   * (2) The Minister must recommend to the GovernorGeneral that the GovernorGeneral make regulations under subitem (1) before 1 January 2014.

##### 3  First objective--quarterly credits in anticipation of refundable tax offset

   * (1) The first objective is that an R&D entity will be credited by the Commissioner quarterly amounts for an income year if particular requirements are satisfied.

   * Note 1: These requirements include the R&D entity satisfying eligibility criteria and other matters (for example, see Part 3).

   * Note 2: Receiving quarterly credits may result in the R&D entity being paid an amount out of the Consolidated Revenue Fund (see section 16 of the _Taxation Administration Act 1953_).

   * (2) Three of the eligibility criteria for a quarterly credit for an income year are:

      * (a) that it is reasonable to expect that the R&D entity will be entitled to a refundable R&D tax offset for the income year relating to R&D activities conducted during the income year; and

      * (b) if Innovation Australia makes one or more findings about the R&D activities or purported R&D activities--that those findings are positive; and

      * (c) that the quarter begins on or after 1 January 2014.

   * Note: There may be additional eligibility criteria (for example, see subparagraph 5(1)(a)(ii)).

##### 4  Second objective--tax neutral consequences

   * (1) The second objective is that, as far as practicable, there be taxneutral consequences for an R&D entity receiving quarterly credits.

   * Note 1: This objective is for the R&D entity to be in the same position, for income tax purposes, whether:

         * (a) the R&D entity receives quarterly credits for an income year; or

         * (b) the R&D entity does not receive those quarterly credits, and becomes entitled, after the end of the income year, to the refundable R&D tax offset for the income year.

   * Note 2: Achieving this objective could include providing for a reconciliation and other integrity measures (for example, see paragraphs 5(1)(l) and (p) and subitem 5(4)).

   * (2) For the purposes of subitem (1), disregard consequences relating to time.

#### Part 3--Modified Acts may provide for certain matters

##### 5  Some matters the modified Acts may provide for

   * (1) As a result of the regulations, the collective operation of the relevant Acts may provide for any or all of the following matters:

      * (a) eligibility criteria for quarterly credits, including:

      * (i) deadlines for doing things in relation to quarterly credits or the making of IA findings;

      * (j) how amounts of quarterly credits are worked out;

      * (k) that each quarterly credit is a credit the R&D entity is entitled to under a taxation law for the purposes of Part IIB of the _Taxation Administration Act 1953_;

      * (l) that an R&D entity's total credits for an income year become a debt due to the Commonwealth at a specified time after the end of the income year;

   * Note 1: Innovation Australia's findings (see paragraph (c)) could be made before, during or after the consideration of an application for quarterly credits.

   * (3) Fees referred to in paragraph (1)(e) must not be such as to amount to taxation.

   * (4) Without limiting paragraph (1)(p), examples of integrity measures include the following:

      * (a) if an R&D entity's total credits for an income year exceeds the amount of the R&D entity's entitlement to a refundable R&D tax offset for the income year--that the R&D entity may be liable to pay a penalty on the excess;

      * (b) if the approval of an R&D entity's application for quarterly credits for an income year is revoked--that the R&D entity's total credits for the income year become a debt due to the Commonwealth at a specified time.

   * (5) As a result of the regulations, the collective operation of the relevant Acts may provide that a disclosure referred to in paragraph (1)(r) may be made despite:

      * (a) subsection 47(1) of the _Industry Research and Development Act 1986_; and

   * (3) This item does not limit item 2.

#### Part 4--Alternative constitutional basis

   * (2) Without limiting its effect apart from this subitem, the modified operation of each relevant Act as a result of the regulations has the effect it would have if:

      * (a) subitem (1) had not been enacted; and

      * (b) the relevant Act applied so that quarterly credits could only be worked out in respect of activities, or parts of activities, conducted or to be conducted:
