     *  	Subdivision E sets out when goods that are clothing or textiles that are produced entirely in the US, or in the US and Australia, from non-originating materials only, or from non-originating materials and originating materials, are US originating goods.

     *  	Subdivision F sets out when accessories, spare parts or tools (imported with other goods) are US originating goods.

     *  	Subdivision G deals with how the packaging materials or containers in which goods are packaged affects whether the goods are US originating goods.

     *  	Subdivision H deals with how the consignment of goods affects whether the goods are US originating goods.

##### 153YA  Interpretation

    * _Definitions_

##### Subdivision C--Goods produced entirely in the US or in the US and Australia exclusively from originating materials

##### 153YC  Goods produced entirely in the US or in the US and Australia exclusively from originating materials

    * Goods are **_US originating goods_** if they are produced entirely in the US, or entirely in the US and Australia, exclusively from originating materials.

##### Subdivision D--Goods (except clothing and textiles) produced entirely in the US or in the US and Australia from non-originating materials

##### 153YD  Simplified outline

    * The following is a simplified outline of this Subdivision: 

     *  	This Subdivision sets out when goods (except clothing and textiles) that are produced entirely in the US, or in the US and Australia, from non-originating materials only, or from non-originating materials and originating materials, are US originating goods.

     *  	The goods may be US originating goods under section 153YE (which applies to all goods except clothing and textiles).

     *  	The goods may also be US originating goods under section 153YF (which applies only to goods that are chemicals, plastics or rubber).

##### 153YE  Goods (except clothing and textiles) produced entirely in the US or in the US and Australia from non-originating materials

    * (1) Goods are **_US originating goods_** if:

     * (a) a tariff classification (the **_final classification_**) that is specified in column 2 of the Schedule 1 tariff table applies to the goods; and

     * (b) they are produced entirely in the US, or entirely in the US and Australia, from non-originating materials only or from non-originating materials and originating materials; and

     * (c) if any of the following 3 requirements apply in relation to the goods--that requirement is satisfied.

    * _First requirement_

    * _	(2)	Subject to subsection (3), the first requirement applies only if a change in tariff classification is specified in column 3 of the Schedule 1 tariff table opposite the final classification for the goods. The first requirement is that:

     * (a) each of the non-originating materials satisfies the transformation test (see subsection (8)); or

     * (b) the following are satisfied:

      * (i) the total value of all the non-originating materials does not exceed 10% of the customs value of the goods;

      * (ii) if one or more of the non-originating materials are prescribed for the purposes of this paragraph--each of those non-originating materials satisfies the transformation test (see subsection (8)).

      * Note 1: Paragraph (2)(b) relates to Article 5.2 (De Minimis) of the Agreement.

      * Note 2: The value of the non-originating materials is to be worked out in accordance with the regulations: see subsection 153YA(2).

    * (3) However, the first requirement does not apply if:

     * (a) an alternative requirement to the change in tariff classification is also specified in column 3 of the Schedule 1 tariff table opposite the final classification for the goods; and

     * (b) that alternative requirement is satisfied.

    * _Second requirement_

    * _	(4)	Subject to subsection (5), the second requirement applies only if a regional value content requirement is specified in column 3 of the Schedule 1 tariff table opposite the final classification for the goods. The second requirement is that the goods satisfy that regional value content requirement.

    * (5) However, the second requirement does not apply if:

     * (a) an alternative requirement to the regional value content requirement is also specified in column 3 of the Schedule 1 tariff table opposite the final classification for the goods; and

     * (b) that alternative requirement is satisfied.

    * (6) The regulations may prescribe different regional value content requirements for different kinds of goods.

    * _Third requirement_

    * _	(7)	The third requirement is that the goods satisfy any other requirement that is specified in, or referred to in, column 3 of the Schedule 1 tariff table opposite the final classification for the goods.

    * _Transformation test_

    * _	(8)	A non-originating material satisfies the transformation test if:

     * (a) it satisfies the change in tariff classification that is specified in column 3 of the Schedule 1 tariff table opposite the final classification for the goods; or

     * (b) it does not satisfy the change in tariff classification mentioned in paragraph (a), but it was produced entirely in the US, or entirely in the US and Australia, from other non-originating materials, and each of those materials satisfies the transformation test (including by one or more applications of this subsection).

      * Note 1: Paragraph (8)(b) relates to paragraph 2 of Article 5.3 (Accumulation) of the Agreement.

      * Note 2: Subsection (8) operates in a recursive manner: a non-originating material may satisfy the transformation test in its own right, or it may satisfy it because each non-originating material used to produce it satisfies the transformation test (whether because each of those materials does so in its own right, or because each non-originating material used to produce the material does so), and so on.

##### 153YF  Goods that are chemicals, plastics or rubber

    * Goods are **_US originating goods_** if:

     * (a) they are produced entirely in the US, or entirely in the US and Australia, from non-originating materials only or from non-originating materials and originating materials; and

     * (b) they are goods that are classified to any of Chapters 28 to 40 of the Harmonized System; and

     * (c) a tariff classification (the **_final classification_**) that is specified in column 2 of the Schedule 1 tariff table applies to the goods; and

     * (d) before the tariff classifications in column 2 of that table in relation to Chapter 28 or 39 of the Harmonized System, the regulations specify particular rules in column 3 of that table; and

     * (e) those rules apply in relation to the final classification for the goods; and

     * (f) the goods satisfy those rules.

##### Subdivision E--Goods that are clothing or textiles produced entirely in the US or in the US and Australia from non-originating materials

##### 153YG  Simplified outline

    * The following is a simplified outline of this Subdivision: 

     *  	This Subdivision sets out when goods that are clothing or textiles that are produced entirely in the US, or in the US and Australia, from non-originating materials only, or from non-originating materials and originating materials, are US originating goods.

     *  	The goods may be US originating goods under section 153YH (which applies to all clothing and textiles).

     *  	The goods may also be US originating goods under section 153YI (which applies only to clothing and textiles classified to Chapter 62 of the Harmonized System).

##### 153YH  Goods that are clothing or textiles produced entirely in the US or in the US and Australia from non-originating materials

    * (1) Subject to subsection (5), goods are **_US originating goods _**if:

     * (a) a tariff classification (the **_final classification_**) that is specified in column 2 of the Schedule 2 tariff table applies to the goods; and

     * (b) they are produced entirely in the US, or entirely in the US and Australia, from non-originating materials only or from non-originating materials and originating materials; and

     * (c) if any of the following 2 requirements apply in relation to the goods--that requirement is satisfied.

      * Note: Subsection (5) sets out a qualification for goods put up in a set for retail sale.

    * _First requirement_

    * _	(2)	The first requirement applies only if a change in tariff classification is specified in column 3 of the Schedule 2 tariff table opposite the final classification for the goods. The first requirement is that:

     * (a) subject to subsection (3), each of the non-originating materials satisfies the transformation test (see subsection (7)); or

     * (b) the following are satisfied:

      * (i) the total weight of all the non-originating materials does not exceed 7% of the total weight of the goods;

      * (ii) if one or more of the non-originating materials are prescribed for the purposes of this paragraph--each of those non-originating materials satisfies the transformation test (see subsection (7)).

      * Note: Paragraph (2)(b) relates to paragraphs 6 and 7 (De Minimis) of Article 4.2 of the Agreement.

    * (3) In relation to goods classified to Chapter 61, 62 or 63 of the Harmonized System, paragraph (2)(a) is to be applied by applying:

     * (a) for goods covered by Chapter 61 of the Harmonized System--Chapter Rule 2 for Chapter 61 that is set out in the Schedule 2 tariff table; and

     * (b) for goods covered by Chapter 62 of the Harmonized System--Chapter Rule 3 for Chapter 62 that is set out in the Schedule 2 tariff table; and

     * (c) for goods covered by Chapter 63 of the Harmonized System--Chapter Rule 1 for Chapter 63 that is set out in the Schedule 2 tariff table.

    * _Second requirement_

    * _	(4)	The second requirement is that the goods satisfy any other requirement that is specified in, or referred to in, column 3 of the Schedule 2 tariff table opposite the final classification for the goods.

    * _Goods put up in a set for retail sale_

    * _	(5)	However, if:

     * (a) the goods are put up in a set for retail sale; and

     * (b) the goods are classified in accordance with Rule 3 of the Interpretation Rules;

    * the goods are **_US originating goods _**only if:

     * (c) all of the goods in the set are US originating goods under this Division; or

     * (d) the total value of the goods in the set that are not US originating goods under this Division does not exceed 10% of the customs value of the set of goods.

      * Note: The value of the goods in the set is to be worked out in accordance with the regulations: see subsection 153YA(2).

    * (6) In applying paragraph (5)(c), assume the goods were not part of a set.

      * Example: A skirt and a belt are put up in a set for retail sale. The skirt and the belt have been classified under Rule 3 of the Interpretation Rules according to the tariff classification applicable to skirts.

      * The effect of subsection (6) is that the origin of the belt must now be determined according to the tariff classification applicable to belts.

    * _Transformation test_

     * (a) a person is, or will be, a performer in the performance; or

     * (b) the performance is being, or will be, presented by a particular group of performers.

      * Note: For the definition of **_staged_**, see section 191A.

      * Example 1: The stager of a live performance given by X and Y attributes the performance to A and B. This is an act of false attribution in relation to both X and Y.

      * Example 2: The stager of a live performance given by X and Y attributes the performance to X and A. This is an act of false attribution in relation to both X and Y (even though X is mentioned in the attribution).

    * (2) For a live performance, it is an act of false attribution for the stager of the performance, or a person authorised by the stager, to state falsely, or imply falsely, to the audience during the performance that:

     * (a) a person is, was, or will be a performer in the performance; or

     * (b) the performance is being, was, or will be, presented by a particular group of performers.

    * (3) For a live performance, it is an act of false attribution for the stager of the performance, or a person authorised by the stager, to state falsely, or imply falsely, to the audience immediately after the performance that:

     * (a) a person was a performer in the performance; or

     * (b) a particular group of performers presented the performance.

    * (4) However, doing an act mentioned in subsection (1), (2) or (3) is only an act of false attribution if the performance is in public or is communicated to the public. For this purpose, any unauthorised communication to the public is to be disregarded.

    * _Acts of false attribution for recorded performances--individual performers_

    * _	(5)	For a recorded performance, each of the following acts is an act of false attribution:

     * (a) to insert or affix, or authorise the inserting or affixing of, a person's name in or on a record embodying the performance in such a way as to imply falsely that the person is a performer in the performance;

     * (b) to deal with a record embodying the performance if:

      * (i) a person's name has been inserted or affixed in or on the record as mentioned in paragraph (a); and

      * (ii) the attributor knows that the person is not a performer in the performance;

     * (c) to communicate the recorded performance to the public as being a performance in which a person is a performer, if the attributor knows that the person is not a performer in the performance.

    * _Acts of false attribution for recorded performances--groups of performers_

    * _	(6)	For a recorded performance, each of the following acts is an act of false attribution:

     * (a) to insert or affix, or authorise the inserting or affixing of, a group name in or on a record embodying the performance in such a way as to imply falsely that the group are performers in the performance;

     * (b) to deal with a record embodying the performance if:

      * (i) a group name has been inserted or affixed in or on the record as mentioned in paragraph (a); and

      * (ii) the attributor knows that the group are not performers in the performance;

     * (c) to communicate the recorded performance to the public as being a performance in which a group are performers, if the attributor knows that the group are not performers in the performance.

    * _Silent performers_

    * _	(7)	It is not an act of false attribution of performership to state that a performer who participated silently in a performance performed in the performance.

      * Example: X and Y together present a cabaret act in which X sings and Y dances silently. The "performance" for the purposes of this Part consists only of the sounds made by X. It is not an act of false attribution in respect of the performance to state or imply that Y was also a performer.

##### 195AHC  Act of false attribution of performership of altered recorded performance

    * (1) If the work is a recorded performance that has been altered by a person other than a performer in the performance, it is an act of false attribution of performership in relation to the performer to deal with a copy of the recorded performance as so altered, as being a copy of the unaltered recorded performance, if, to the knowledge of the attributor, the copy of the recorded performance is not a copy of the unaltered recorded performance.

    * (2) Subsection (1) does not apply if:

     * (a) the effect of the alteration is insubstantial; or

     * (b) the alteration was required by law to be made, or was otherwise necessary to avoid a breach of any law.

##### 195ALB  Derogatory treatment of performance

    * In this Part: 

    * **_derogatory treatment_**, in relation to a performer in a live performance or recorded performance, means the doing, in relation to the performance, of anything that results in a material distortion of, the mutilation of, or a material alteration to, the performance that is prejudicial to the performer's reputation.

##### 195AZGD  Presumption as to subsistence of copyright

    * (1) In an action brought under this Part for an infringement of a moral right in respect of a recorded performance, if copyright is presumed or proved to have subsisted in the recorded performance when the infringement is alleged to have occurred, then the moral right is presumed to have subsisted in the recorded performance at that time.

##### 195AZGF  Presumptions in relation to performership

    * (1) If a name purporting to be the name of a performer appears on a record embodying a performance so as to indicate that the person was a performer in the performance, then, in an action brought under this Part, the person whose name so appeared is, if it was his or her true name or a name by which he or she was commonly known, presumed, unless the contrary is established, to be a performer in the performance.

    * (2) If a name purporting to be the name of a group of performers appears on a record embodying a performance so as to indicate that the group performed in the performance, then, in an action brought under this Part, the group whose name so appeared is, if it was a name by which the group was commonly known, presumed, unless the contrary is established, to have performed in the performance.

    * (1) This section applies to a live performance or recorded performance that has more than one performer.

    * (2) A performer's right of attribution of performership in respect of the performance is a right of the performer to be identified as a performer.

      * Example: If X and Y are the performers in a performance, then each of them has the right to be identified. However, there is no infringement of X's moral right if Y is not identified (and vice versa).

      * Note: See also subsection 195ABC(3), which relates to the use of group names.

    * (3) An act of false attribution of performership in respect of the performance infringes each performer's right not to have performership falsely attributed.

      * Example: X and Y are the performers in a performance that is falsely attributed to X and Z. This false attribution infringes X's moral right and Y's moral right.

    * (4) The right of integrity of performership in respect of the performance is a right of each performer.

      * Example: X and Y are the performers in a performance. The performance is subjected to derogatory treatment that is prejudicial to X's reputation but not to Y's reputation. The result is an infringement of X's right of integrity of performership but not an infringement of Y's right of integrity of performership.

    * (5) The consent of one performer to any act or omission affecting his or her moral rights in respect of the performance does not affect the moral rights of any other performer in respect of the performance.

##### 195AZR  Application

    * (1) Moral rights in respect of a live performance only subsist in a live performance that occurs after the commencement of this section.

    * (2) Moral rights in respect of a recorded performance only subsist if the live performance concerned occurs after the commencement of this section.
