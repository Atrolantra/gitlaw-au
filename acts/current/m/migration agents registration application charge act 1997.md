### 
### An Act to impose charge in relation to the registration of migration agents


### Part 1--Preliminary

##### 1  Short title [see Note 1]

   * This Act may be cited as the _Migration Agents Registration Application Charge Act 1997_.

##### 2  Commencement

   * This Act commences on 21 March 1998.

### Part 2--Imposition of charge on registration applications

##### 3  Definitions

   * In this Part, unless the contrary intention appears:

   * **_charge limit_** for a registration application made in a financial year has the meaning given by section 7.

   * **_registration application_** has the same meaning as in Part 3 of the _Migration Act 1958_.

##### 4  Imposition of charge

   * Charge is imposed on an individual's making of a registration application on or after 21 March 1998.

##### 5  Who must pay charge?

   * Charge is payable by the individual making the registration application.

##### 6  Amount of charge

   * (1) The amount of charge payable on an individual's making of a registration application is the amount prescribed by the regulations for an individual of that kind.

   * (2) The regulations may prescribe different amounts (including nil amounts) for different kinds of individuals making registration applications.

   * (3) The regulations must not prescribe an amount more than the charge limit for the registration application.

##### 7  What is the charge limit?

   * (1) The **_charge limit_** for a registration application made in the financial year ending at the end of 30 June 2002 is $1,800.

   * (2) Work out the **_charge limit_** for a registration application made in a later financial year by:

    * (a) multiplying the charge limit for the immediately preceding financial year by the greater of:

     * (i) the indexation factor worked out using the formula in subsection (3); and

     * (ii) 1.0; and

    * (b) rounding the product to the nearest multiple of $5 (rounding an odd multiple of $2.50 to the next higher multiple of $5).

   * (3) The formula for the indexation factor is:



   * where: 

   * **_CPI quarter_** means a period of 3 months ending on 31 March, 30 June, 30 September or 31 December.

   * **_index number_** means the All Groups Consumer Price Index number (being the weighted average of the 8 capital cities) published by the Australian Statistician.

   * (4) The indexation factor is to be calculated to 3 decimal places, but increased by .001 if the 4th decimal place is more than 4.

   * (5) When working out the indexation factor:

    * (a) use only the index numbers published in terms of the most recently published reference base for the Consumer Price Index; and

    * (b) disregard index numbers published in substitution for previously published index numbers (except where the substituted numbers are published to take account of changes in the reference base).

##### 8  Regulations

   * The Governor-General may make regulations for the purposes of section 6.

### Part 3--Imposition of charge in respect of the status of a migration agent's registration

##### 9  Interpretation

   * (1) In this Part:

   * **_non-commercial application fee _**means charge payable under regulation 5 of the Charge Regulations.

   * **_registered migration agent _**has the same meaning as in Part 3 of the _Migration Act 1958_.

   * (2) For the purposes of this Part, a registered migration agent gives immigration assistance on a **_commercial basis _**if he or she gives immigration assistance:

    * (a) on a commercial, or for-profit, basis; or

    * (b) as a member of, or a person associated with, an organisation that operates on a commercial, or for-profit, basis.

##### 12  Amount of charge

   * _Amount of charge_

   * where: 

   * **_commercial application fee _**means the amount of charge that would have been payable by the agent under regulation 4 of the Charge Regulations, if that regulation had applied in relation to his or her current period of registration.

   * **_paid fee _**means the non-commercial application fee paid by the agent in relation to his or her current period of registration.

   * **_remaining period _**means the period:

    * (a) beginning on the first day in the current period of the agent's registration on which he or she gives immigration assistance on a commercial basis; and
