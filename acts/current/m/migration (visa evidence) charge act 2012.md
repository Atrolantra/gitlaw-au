##### 4  Extra-territorial operation

  * Visa evidence charge is payable in relation to a request for evidence of a visa whether the request is made inside Australia or outside Australia.

##### 5  Definitions

  * In this Act:

##### 6  Imposition of visa evidence charge

  * Visa evidence charge payable under section 71 of the Migration Act is imposed.

##### 7  Visa evidence charge limit

  * (1) The **_visa evidence charge limit_** for a visa evidence request made in the financial year ending on 30 June 2013 is $250.

  * (2) The **_visa evidence charge limit_** for a visa evidence request made in a later financial year is the amount worked out by multiplying the limit for the immediately preceding financial year by the greater of 1 or the indexation factor.

  * _Indexation factor_

  * _	(3)	The **_indexation factor_** is the number worked out using the following formula:

  * where:

  * **_index number_** means the All Groups Consumer Price Index number (being the weighted average of the 8 capital cities) published by the Australian Statistician.

  * (4) The indexation factor is to be calculated to 3 decimal places (rounding up if the fourth decimal place is 5 or more).

  * (5) In working out the indexation factor:

   * (a) use only the index numbers published in terms of the most recently published reference base for the Consumer Price Index; and

   * (b) disregard index numbers published in substitution for previously published index numbers (except where the substituted numbers are published to take account of changes in the reference base).

  * _Rounding of limit_

   * (a) if the amount exceeds the nearest lower multiple of $5 by $2.50 or more--round the amount up to the nearest higher multiple of $5;

   * (b) otherwise--round the amount down to the nearest lower multiple of $5.
