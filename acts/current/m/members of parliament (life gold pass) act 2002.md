   * _Spouses entitled before commencement_

   * _(1)	If, immediately before the commencement of the amendments of the _Members of Parliament (Life Gold Pass) Act 2002 _made by this Schedule, the spouse of a person was entitled to domestic return trips under that Act, the following provisions of that Act apply as if the spouse were nominated under section 9B of that Act:

     * (a) sections 9A and 9B;

     * (b) the definition of **_surviving spouse or de facto partner_** in section 4.

   * (2) Subitem (1) does not prevent a person from revoking a nomination, or giving a subsequent nomination, under section 9B of that Act.

   * _Spouses or de facto partners who become entitled on commencement_

   * _(3)	If:

     * (a) on or after the commencement of the amendments of the _Members of Parliament (Life Gold Pass) Act 2002 _made by this Schedule, a person makes a nomination under section 9B of that Act; and

     * (b) the nomination names someone who was the spouse or de facto partner of the person on the day on which the amendments commenced;

   * _(4)	The amendments of the _Members of Parliament (Life Gold Pass) Act 2002 _made by this Schedule apply in relation to entitlements to domestic return trips for the surviving spouse or de facto partner of a person if the person's death occurs on or after the commencement of the amendments.

   * _Application of amendments to widows and widowers_

   * _(5)	If, immediately before the commencement of the amendments of the _Members of Parliament (Life Gold Pass) Act 2002 _made by this Schedule, a person was the widow of a deceased man or the widower of a deceased woman within the meaning of that Act, the person is, after commencement, taken to be the surviving spouse or de facto partner of the man or woman within the meaning of that Act as amended.

   * _Members of Parliament (Life Gold Pass) and Other Legislation Amendment Act 2012_ (No. 4, 2012)

##### Schedule 1

##### 8  Application of items 6 and 7

   * To avoid doubt: 

     * (a) item 6 of this Schedule applies to every former member who is a holder of a Life Gold Pass, and the spouse or de facto partner of such a member, whether the former member became a holder of a Life Gold Pass before, on or after the commencement of that item; and

     * (b) item 7 of this Schedule applies to the spouse or de facto partner of every member who:

      * (i) has never held office as Prime Minister; and

      * (ii) has satisfied the relevant qualifying period for the issue of a Life Gold Pass;

     * whether the member satisfied those requirements before, on or after the commencement of that item.

##### 9  Entitlements for the transition period

   * (1) Despite subsections 11(2) and 12(2) of the _Members of Parliament (Life Gold Pass) Act 2002_, if:

     * (a) under table item 1 or 2 of subsection 11(2) or table item 3 of subsection 12(2) of that Act, a person is entitled to a number of domestic return trips for the year ending on 30 June 2012; and

     * (b) the number of unused domestic return trips for that year to which the person is entitled immediately before the transition day is more than 2; and

     * (c) this item commences before 1 July 2012;

   * the number of those domestic return trips to which the person is entitled, for the period starting at the start of the transition day and ending on 30 June 2012, is reduced to 2.

   * (2) For the purposes of this item, the number of unused domestic return trips to which the person is entitled immediately before the transition day is the difference between:

     * (a) the number of domestic return trips to which the person would, but for this item, be entitled for the year ending on 30 June 2012; and

     * (b) the number of such trips that the person has taken, or started to take, during the year but before the transition day.

   * (3) In this item:

   * **_transition day_** means the later of:

     * (a) the day on which this item commences; and

     * (b) 1 April 2012.

##### 10  Compensation--constitutional safety net

   * (1) If:

     * (a) the operation of this Act would result in the acquisition of property otherwise than on just terms; and

     * (b) the acquisition would not be valid, apart from this item, because a particular person has not been compensated;

   * the Commonwealth is liable to pay a reasonable amount of compensation to the person.

   * (2) If the Commonwealth and the person do not agree on the amount of the compensation, the person may institute proceedings in the Federal Court of Australia for the recovery from the Commonwealth of such reasonable amount of compensation as the court determines.

   * (3) In this item:

   * **_acquisition of property_** has the same meaning as in paragraph 51(xxxi) of the Constitution.

   * **_just terms_** has the same meaning as in paragraph 51(xxxi) of the Constitution.
