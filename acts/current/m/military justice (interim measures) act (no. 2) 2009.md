##### 2  Object and effect of Schedule etc.

  * (1) The main object of this Schedule is to maintain the continuity of discipline in the Defence Force.

  * (2) The provisions of this Schedule that declare people to have particular rights or liabilities have effect for Defence Force service purposes only.

  * (3) If a provision of this Schedule:

     * (a) would, apart from this subitem, have an application (an **_invalid application_**) in relation to:

       * (i) one or more particular persons, things, matters, places, circumstances or cases; or

       * (ii) one or more classes (however defined or determined) of persons, things, matters, places, circumstances or cases;

     * because of which the provision exceeds the Commonwealth's legislative power; and

     * (b) also has at least one application (a **_valid application_**) in relation to:

       * (i) one or more particular persons, things, matters, places, circumstances or cases; or

       * (ii) one or more classes (however defined or determined) of persons, things, matters, places, circumstances or cases;

     * that, if it were the provision's only application, would be within the Commonwealth's legislative power;

  * it is the Parliament's intention that the provision is not to have the invalid application, but is to have every valid application.

##### 3  Reliance on, and enforcement of, declared rights etc.

  * (1) This item applies if, under an item of this Schedule (the **_applicable item_**), the rights and liabilities of a person are declared to be, and always to have been, the same as if certain matters (the **_assumed matters_**) specified in the applicable item had been the case.

  * (2) Without limiting the effect of the applicable item:

     * (a) all persons are, by force of this item, declared to be, and always to have been, entitled to act on the basis that other persons had, and have, the rights and liabilities as declared by the applicable item; and

     * (b) a right or liability that a person is declared to have by the applicable item:

       * (i) is exercisable or enforceable; and

       * (ii) is to be regarded as always having been exercisable or enforceable;

     * as if the assumed matters had in fact been the case.

  * (3) This item has effect subject to subitem 2(2).

##### Part 2--Things done by the AMC, otherwise than on appeal

##### 4  Application of Part

  * This Part applies to things purportedly done by the AMC, otherwise than under Part IX of the old Defence Force Discipline Act, before the High Court decision date.

  * Note: Part IX of the old Defence Force Discipline Act dealt with appeals to the AMC. Appeals to the AMC are dealt with in Part 3 of this Schedule.

##### 5  Effect of punishments and Part IV orders

  * (1) This item applies if the AMC purported to:

     * (a) impose a punishment, other than imprisonment as mentioned in paragraph 68(1)(a) or (b) of the old Defence Force Discipline Act; or

     * (b) make a Part IV order.

  * (2) The rights and liabilities of all persons are, by force of this item, declared to be, and always to have been, the same as if:

     * (a) the amended Defence Force Discipline Act had been in force on and after the time (the **_punishment time_**) when the punishment or order was purportedly imposed or made; and

     * (b) the punishment or order had instead been properly imposed or made at the punishment time, under that Act as so in force, by a general court martial; and

     * (c) the following were the case, under Part VIIIA of that Act as so in force, immediately after the punishment time:

       * (i) a competent reviewing authority had reviewed the punishment or order imposed or made by the general court martial;

       * (ii) the reviewing authority had approved the punishment or order, or had decided not to quash or revoke the punishment or order;

       * (iii) any possibility of further review (other than review provided for by Part 7 of this Schedule) had been exhausted; and

     * (d) if:

       * (i) the punishment is detention or a fine; and

       * (ii) the AMC also purported to make an order (the **_suspension order_**) under section 78 or 79 of the old Defence Force Discipline Act suspending the whole or part of the punishment;

     * in addition to paragraphs (b) and (c) of this subitem, the general court martial had, immediately after the punishment time, made an order under section 78 or 79 of the amended Defence Force Discipline Act as so in force in the same terms as the suspension order.

  * (3) If the punishment is dismissal, and the AMC purported, under subsection 171(1B) of the old Defence Force Discipline Act, to order that the dismissal was to take effect on a specified day, subitem (2) applies as if the general court martial had made an order in the same terms (and had power to make that order).

     * (b) in relation to which the AMC had not, by the High Court decision date, imposed a punishment or made an order under Part IV of the old Defence Force Discipline Act.

  * (3) For the purposes of this item, the purported dismissal of a charge under section 132B or 132D of the old Defence Force Discipline Act is taken to be a purported acquittal by the AMC of the service offence that was the subject of the charge.

  * (4) This item does not affect the jurisdiction of a civil court (as defined in the amended Defence Force Discipline Act) to try a charge of a civil court offence (as defined in that Act).

##### 7  Effect of administrative actions taken in relation to person purportedly convicted by the AMC

  * (1) This item applies if (whether before, on or after the High Court decision date) administrative action is or was purportedly taken in relation to a person, for Defence Force service purposes, in reliance on, or by reference to, a purported conviction by the AMC of a person of a service offence.

       * (ii) the summary authority purported to convict the person, and the AMC did not purport to quash the conviction under Part IX of the old Defence Force Discipline Act; and
