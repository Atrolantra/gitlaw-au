     * An applicant: 

      * (a) who has never been registered; or

       * (i) a fit and proper person to give immigration assistance; or

      * (except a conviction that is spent under Part VIIC of the _Crimes Act 1914_); and

##### 290A  Applicant for repeat registration must not be registered if he or she has not done continuing professional development

     * If the applicant has been registered at some time in the 12 months before making the application, he or she must not be registered if the Migration Agents Registration Authority is satisfied that the applicant has not met, within the prescribed period, the requirements prescribed by the regulations for continuing professional development of registered migration agents.

##### 291A  Applicant must not be registered if suspension would be in effect

     * If: 

      * (a) an applicant has been registered (the **_previous registration_**) at some time before making the application; and

      * (b) the Migration Agents Registration Authority decided to suspend the previous registration (whether or not that decision was stayed); and

      * (c) the previous registration ended on or after the suspension decision;

     * then the applicant must not be registered during a period in which the previous registration would have been suspended had the previous registration not already ended.

         * Example 1: A registered migration agent's registration is suspended for a period. The agent is deregistered under section 302 so the suspension of the registration ends. The agent cannot be reregistered until the suspension period ends.

         * Example 2: The Migration Agents Registration Authority suspends a registered migration agent's registration. The agent applies for review of the decision and a stay order is made in relation to the decision. The agent continues to practise, while the stay order is in force, until the agent's registration ends. Subsection 288(6A) prevents the agent from being reregistered until the review proceedings are finalised. The agent cannot be reregistered if the suspension decision is affirmed on review and the suspension would not have ended (had the registration continued).

         * Example 3: Under section 300, a registered migration agent's registration is continued after the expiry day of the agent's registration. The Migration Agents Registration Authority makes a decision to suspend the agent's registration until the agent complies with a condition, and so the registration ends because of subsection 300(4). The agent cannot be reregistered until the agent complies with the condition.

##### 292  Applicant must not be registered if registration cancelled in past 5 years

     * An applicant whose registration has been cancelled under section 303, 306AG or 306AGAC must not be registered within 5 years of the cancellation.

##### 292A  Applicant must not be registered if any barring period has not ended

     * An applicant must not be registered if: 

      * (a) the Migration Agents Registration Authority has made a decision under subsection 311A(1) or 311L(1) to bar him or her from being a registered migration agent for a particular period; and

      * (b) the period has not ended.

##### 292B  Applicant must not be registered unless he or she holds appropriate professional indemnity insurance

     * (1) An applicant must not be registered unless the Migration Agents Registration Authority is satisfied that he or she has professional indemnity insurance of a kind prescribed by the regulations.

     * (2) To avoid doubt, this section applies to all applicants (not just first time applicants).

##### 293  Applicant under 18 must not be registered

     * An applicant must not be registered if he or she is under 18.

##### 294  Applicant must not be registered if not an Australian citizen, permanent resident or New Zealander with special visa

      * (a) an Australian citizen; or

      * (b) an Australian permanent resident (within the meaning of the regulations); or

     * (2) To avoid doubt, this section applies to all applicants (not just first time applicants).

##### 295  Notice of refusal of application

     * If the Migration Agents Registration Authority decides not to register an applicant, the Authority must give the applicant written notice of the decision and of the reasons for it.

         * Note: The applicant may apply to the Administrative Appeals Tribunal for review of the decision. See section 306 of this Act. (Section 27A of the _Administrative Appeals Tribunal Act 1975_ requires that people whose interests are affected by the Authority's decision be given notice of their rights to seek review of the decision.)

##### 299  Period of registration

     * (1) Subject to sections 300, 302, 303, 306AG and 306AGAC and subsection (3), the registration of a registered migration agent lasts for 12 months after the registration.

     * (3) If the registration of a registered migration agent is suspended for a period, the current period of the agent's registration is extended by a period equal to that period of suspension.

##### 300  Automatic continuation of registration

     * When agent's registration is automatically continued

     * (1) Subsection (4) applies to continue a registered migration agent's registration beyond the last day (the **_expiry day_**) of the agent's registration if, before the end of the expiry day:

      * (a) the agent made a registration application; and

      * (b) the agent paid the registration application fee (if any) in respect of the application; and

      * (c) the Migration Agents Registration Authority had not decided the application.

     * Exception--suspension

     * (2) However, subsection (4) does not apply to continue the agent's registration if, before the end of the expiry day, the Authority made a decision to suspend the agent's registration, unless:

      * (a) the suspension had been completed before the end of the expiry day; or

      * (b) there was a decision (other than a stay order) of the Administrative Appeals Tribunal or a court in force, immediately before the end of the expiry day, to the effect that the agent's registration is not suspended or cancelled.

      * (b) there was a decision of the Administrative Appeals Tribunal or a court in force to the effect that the agent's registration is suspended, and the suspension had been completed before the end of the expiry day.

     * Period of continuation of registration

     * (4) The agent's registration is taken to continue after the expiry day until the earliest of the following:

      * (a) the Authority decides the application;

      * (b) the Authority decides to suspend the agent's registration;

      * (c) the Authority decides to cancel the agent's registration;

      * (d) the end of the period of 10 months beginning on the day after the expiry day.

     * Application granted if no decision within a certain period

     * (5) If, before the end of the period of 10 months beginning on the day after the expiry day, the Authority has not:

      * (a) decided the registration application; and

      * (b) decided to suspend the agent's registration; and

      * (c) decided to cancel the agent's registration;

     * then the application is taken to have been granted at the end of that period.

     * When registration takes effect

     * (6) If the Authority grants the registration application, or the registration application is taken to have been granted under subsection (5), the registration is treated as having taken effect at the end of the expiry day.

         * Example: An agent's registration is due to end on 31 October (the expiry day). On 20 October the agent applies to be registered again. The Authority has not decided the application by the end of 31 October.

         * The agent's registration continues automatically past 31 October until the Authority decides the application.

         * On 15 November the Authority grants the application. The new 12 month registration is treated as having taken effect at the end of 31 October.

     * When Authority makes decision

     * (7) For the purposes of this section, the Authority is taken to have made a decision even if the decision is later stayed.

##### 301  Migration Agents Registration Authority must warn of expiry

      * (d) he or she dies.

##### 303  Disciplining registered migration agents

     * (1) The Migration Agents Registration Authority may:

      * (a) cancel the registration of a registered migration agent by removing his or her name from the register; or

      * (b) suspend his or her registration; or

      * (f) the agent is not a person of integrity or is otherwise not a fit and proper person to give immigration assistance; or
