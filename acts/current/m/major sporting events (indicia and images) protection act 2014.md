### An Act to provide for the regulation of the use for commercial purposes of indicia and images associated with certain major sporting events, and for related purposes

##### [Assented to 27 May 2014]

### The Parliament of Australia enacts: 

### Part 1--Preliminary

##### 1  Short title

    * This Act may be cited as the _Major Sporting Events (Indicia and Images) Protection Act 2014._

##### _2  Commencement

    * (1) Each provision of this Act specified in column 1 of the table commences, or is taken to have commenced, in accordance with column 2 of the table. Any other statement in column 2 has effect according to its terms.

       * Note: This table relates only to the provisions of this Act as originally enacted. It will not be amended to deal with any later amendments of this Act.

    * (2) Any information in column 3 of the table is not part of this Act. Information may be inserted in this column, or information in it may be edited, in any published version of this Act.

##### 3  Objects of this Act

    * (1) The objects of this Act are:

     * (a) to protect and further the position of Australia as a participant in, and a supporter of, sporting movements of international significance; and

     * (b) to assist in protecting the relations, and in ensuring the performance of the obligations, of Australian governments and other Australian bodies with, and to, international bodies responsible for major sporting events associated with those movements that are held in Australia.

    * (2) These objects are achieved by facilitating the raising of revenue in relation to major sporting events through the regulation of the use for commercial purposes of the indicia and images associated with those events.

##### 4  Simplified outline of this Act

    * This Act provides special protection in relation to the use for commercial purposes of indicia and images connected with certain major sporting events. The major sporting events are identified in the Schedules to this Act.

    * Generally speaking, a person cannot use a major sporting event's protected indicia or images for commercial purposes during the event's protection period, unless the person is an official user for the event (as defined in this Act).

    * A person does not contravene this prohibition if the person is authorised to use, or is not prevented from using, the indicia or images for commercial purposes under a provision of a law of a State or Territory that is prescribed by the rules or specified in the Schedule to this Act that covers the event.

    * There must be a register, either under this Act or under a State or Territory law, that sets out details about authorisations to use indicia and images for each event. The register must be published on the internet.

    * Goods that are imported into Australia that have had a major sporting event's protected indicia or images applied to them can be seized by Customs and forfeited to the Commonwealth if the designated owner's use of the indicia or images for commercial purposes in relation to the goods would contravene the prohibition in this Act.

    * There are a number of remedies available to official users for a major sporting event, such as injunctions, damages or an account of profits, and corrective advertisements. Some official users need consent before seeking these remedies.

    * If an official user makes a groundless threat to make an application or bring an action under this Act, any person aggrieved may bring an action in a relevant court seeking a declaration or injunction, or damages for loss that the person has suffered as a result of the threat.

##### 5  Act binds the Crown

    * This Act binds the Crown in each of its capacities.

##### 6  Application of Act

    * This Act extends to: 

     * (a) Norfolk Island; and

     * (b) the Territory of Christmas Island; and

     * (c) the Territory of Cocos (Keeling) Islands.

##### 7  Additional operation of Act

    * In addition to its effect apart from this subsection, this Act also has the effect that it would have if each reference to use for commercial purposes were a reference to:

     * (a) use for commercial purposes by:

      * (i) a corporation to which paragraph 51(xx) of the Constitution applies; or

      * (ii) a body corporate incorporated in a Territory; or

     * (b) use for commercial purposes by any person in the course of:

      * (i) trade or commerce with other countries; or

      * (ii) trade or commerce among the States; or

      * (iv) the supply of goods or services to the Commonwealth, a Territory, or to an authority or instrumentality of the Commonwealth or of a Territory; or

     * (c) use for commercial purposes by any person by way of the use of, or in the course of providing, a postal, telegraphic, telephonic or other like service within the meaning of paragraph 51(v) of the Constitution; or

     * (d) use for commercial purposes of:

      * (i) a trade mark; or

      * (ii) a design that is registered, or is capable of being registered, under the _Designs Act 2003_; or

      * (iii) an artistic work in which copyright subsists; or

     * (e) use for commercial purposes by any person that detrimentally affects the rights conferred by or under this Act on an official user that is a corporation to which paragraph 51(xx) of the Constitution applies.

    * Giving information to authorising bodies

    * (5) If a person other than an authorising body has given a relevant authorisation as mentioned in subsection 16(4), that person must give the authorising body sufficient information to allow the authorising body to comply with this section.

##### 19  State/Territory register provisions may apply

    * (1) Section 18 does not apply in relation to a relevant authorisation for a major sporting event if:

     * (a) the Schedule to this Act that covers the event specifies, or the rules prescribe in relation to the event, a provision of a law of a State or Territory that establishes a register (the **_State/Territory register_**) relating to authorisations to use expressions or images in relation to the event; and

     * (b) the State/Territory register contains information about the relevant authorisation.

    * (2) Before making rules for the purposes of paragraph (1)(a) in relation to a major sporting event, the Minister must be satisfied that:

     * (a) substantially the same details in relation to authorisations to use expressions or images in relation to the event are required to be included in the State/Territory register as would otherwise be required to be included under subsections 18(2) and (3) of this Act; and

     * (b) the State/Territory register is required to be published on the internet.

##### 20  Person on register taken to be authorised person

    * (1) If details about an authorisation given to a person are included in the register referred to in section 18, or the State/Territory register referred to in section 19:

     * (a) the person is taken to be an authorised person for the major sporting event concerned; and

     * (b) the use for commercial purposes of any protected indicia or images referred to in the register in relation to the authorisation or the person is taken to be covered by a relevant authorisation given to the authorised person.

    * (2) However, if the register specifies circumstances in which, or a period during which, the person is authorised to use protected indicia or images, then the relevant authorisation referred to in paragraph (1)(b) is taken only to cover the use of the indicia or images in those circumstances or during that period.

       * Note: The effect of this section is that a person can rely on the details included in the register when working out whether another person is an authorised person for the purposes of other provisions of this Act, including:

        * (a) paragraph 12(2)(b) (secondary use of protected indicia or images for commercial purposes); and

        * (b) Part 4 (importation of goods).

##### 21  Notifying Secretary and Customs CEO of changes to registers

### Part 4--Importation of goods

#### Division 1--Introduction

##### 22  Simplified outline of this Part

    * An official user for a major sporting event (the **_objector_**) can give the Customs CEO a notice objecting to the importation of infringing goods in relation to the event.

    * Generally, the Customs CEO must seize any infringing goods imported after the objection notice is given. The Customs CEO may decide not to seize goods if one or more objectors have not given a written undertaking, or security, to cover the Commonwealth's likely expenses if the goods were seized. The Customs CEO may permit objectors to inspect seized goods.

    * The Customs CEO must notify the designated owner if goods are seized. The designated owner may either consent to the forfeiture of the goods to the Commonwealth, or make a claim for release of the goods. If a claim is not made during the claim period, the goods are forfeited to the Commonwealth.

    * If a claim is made during the claim period, the Customs CEO must notify each objector. An objector must apply for an injunction under section 45 before the end of the action period, otherwise the Customs CEO must release the goods to the designated owner.

    * If an application for an injunction is made, the court may:

      * (a) order the release of the goods; or

      * (b) order that the goods be forfeited to the Commonwealth.

    * If the court orders the release of the goods, the court may also order that compensation be paid to the designated owner.

    * The Customs CEO must release the goods if no order of the court is in force within 20 working days after the application is made, or at any time if each objector consents.

    * The Customs CEO may also release seized goods at any time if satisfied that there are no reasonable grounds for believing that the designated owner's use of the indicia or images for commercial purposes in relation to the goods would contravene section 16 and no objector has made an application for an injunction.

    * However, the Customs CEO may retain control of goods if required or allowed under any other Commonwealth law.

    * An official user must notify the Customs CEO if the official user is importing goods that have any of the event's protected indicia or images applied to them.

#### Division 2--Objection to importation and seizure of goods

##### 23  Notice of objection to importation

    * (1) An official user for a major sporting event may give the Customs CEO a written notice objecting to the importation, after the date of the notice, of infringing goods.

    * (2) Goods are **_infringing goods _**if a major sporting event's protected indicia or images have been applied to them, which the designated owner of the goods is not authorised by this Act to use for commercial purposes in relation to the goods.

       * Note: Subsection 12(3) limits when indicia or images are used for commercial purposes for the purposes of this section.

     * (a) when the notice is revoked;

     * (b) at the end of the major sporting event's protection period;

     * (c) for a notice given by an authorised person in relation to protected indicia or images covered by the relevant authority--at the end of the period during which the person is authorised to use the protected indicia or images.

##### 24  Limitation on giving notices of objection to importation

    * (1) A person may only give a notice under section 23 in relation to a major sporting event's protected indicia or images if:

     * (a) the person is an event body for the event and the protected indicia or images relate to the event body; or

     * (b) the person is an authorised person for the event and the protected indicia or images are covered by the relevant authorisation.

       * Note 1: For when protected indicia or images relate to an event body for a major sporting event, see the Schedule to this Act that covers the event.

       * Note 2: An event body may also be an authorised person for the event if the event body has a relevant authorisation in relation to particular protected indicia or images.

    * Authorised persons require consent

    * (2) An authorised person for a major sporting event may not give a notice under section 23 in relation to protected indicia or images covered by a relevant authorisation except with the written consent of the person (the **_authoriser_**) who gave the authorisation.

       * Note: See also subsection 49(4) (consent not required in order to apply for injunction relating to conduct involving seized goods).

    * (3) The authoriser is taken to have given the consent if:

     * (a) the authorised person gives the authoriser a written request for the consent; and

     * (b) the authoriser neither gives nor refuses that consent before the end of the third working day following the day on which the request was given.

    * (2) The Customs CEO may decide not to seize the goods if he or she is satisfied that there are no reasonable grounds for believing that section 16 of this Act would be contravened by the designated owner's use of the indicia or images for commercial purposes in relation to the goods.

    * (3) The Customs CEO may decide not to seize the goods if:

     * (a) the objector (or one or more of the objectors) has not given the Customs CEO a written undertaking acceptable to the Customs CEO to repay to the Commonwealth the expenses (the **_seizure expenses_**) that may be incurred by the Commonwealth if the goods were seized; or

     * (b) if the Customs CEO has required security to be given as mentioned in subsection (4)--the objector (or one or more of the objectors) does not give the security.

    * (4) The Customs CEO may require security to be given, instead of an undertaking mentioned in paragraph (3)(a), in an amount that the Customs CEO considers sufficient to repay the seizure expenses if:

     * (a) an amount payable under an undertaking given under paragraph (3)(a) by the objector (or one or more of the objectors) in relation to other goods has not been paid in accordance with that undertaking; and
