##### Guide to Division 115

##### 1151  What this Division is about

     * You pay quarterly instalments of MRRT under this Division if you have mining revenue for a quarter or a positive instalment rate.

     * Instalments give rise to a credit once an assessment of the MRRT is made.

     * The amount of a quarterly instalment is the product of your instalment income for the quarter and your applicable instalment rate.

     * The applicable instalment rate may be a rate chosen by you, a rate given to you by the Commissioner, or a statutory default rate.

     * General interest charge may be payable if a rate you choose for a quarter is too low, having regard to the amount of MRRT you are liable to pay for the year.

          * Note 2: For **_applicable instalment rate_**, see section 11545.

     * Meaning of **instalment quarter**

     * **	(2)	For an *MRRT year (whether it ends on 30 June or not), the following are the **_instalment quarters_**:

       * (a) your first **_instalment quarter_** consists of the first 3 months of the MRRT year;

##### 11515  Information to be given to the Commissioner

     * (1) If you are liable to pay an instalment for an *instalment quarter (even if it is a nil amount), you must notify the Commissioner of the amount of your *instalment income for the quarter.

     * (2) You must notify the Commissioner in the *approved form and on or before the day when the instalment is due (regardless of whether it is paid).

     * (3) Subsection (1) does not apply to you for an *instalment quarter if:

       * (a) a nil rate determination under subsection 11545(2) or (3) applies to you for the quarter; and

       * (b) you are exempted from compliance with subsection (1) for the quarter:

         * (i) by a written notice the Commissioner gives you; or

         * (ii) by a legislative instrument that the Commissioner makes, exempting a class of entities.

     * (4) An exemption under subsection (3) may be combined in the same document as a nil rate determination.

##### 11520  Credit for instalments payable

     * (1) You are entitled to a credit when the Commissioner makes an assessment of the amount (including a nil amount) of *MRRT you are liable to pay.

     * (2) The amount of the credit is:

       * (a) the total of each instalment payable by you for the *MRRT year (even if you have not yet paid it); _less_

       * _	(b)	the total of each credit that you have claimed under section 11560 or 115100.

     * (3) The making of the assessment, and the resulting credit entitlement, do not affect the liability to pay an instalment.

          * Note: How the credit is applied is set out in Division 3 of Part IIB.

##### 11525  When instalments are due

     * An instalment you are liable to pay in relation to an *instalment quarter is due on or before the 21st day of the month after the end of that quarter.

##### 11530  General interest charge on late payment

     * If you fail to pay some or all of an instalment by the time by which the instalment is due to be paid, you are liable to pay the *general interest charge on the unpaid amount for each day in the period that:

       * (a) started at the beginning of the day by which the instalment was due to be paid; and

       * (b) finishes at the end of the last day on which, at the end of the day, any of the following remains unpaid:

         * (i) the instalment;

         * (ii) general interest charge on any of the instalment.

##### Subdivision 115C--Working out instalment amounts

        * 11535	How to work out the amount of an instalment

        * 11540	Meaning of instalment income

        * 11545	Meaning of applicable instalment rate

##### 11535  How to work out the amount of an instalment

     * The amount of an instalment you are liable to pay in relation to *MRRT, in relation to an *instalment quarter, is:

##### 11540  Meaning of instalment income

     * Your **_instalment income_** for an *instalment quarter in an *MRRT year is the sum of the amounts worked out under column 2 of the table in subsection 3025(2) of the _Minerals Resource Rent Tax Act 2012 _for each *mining revenue event that:

       * (a) happens during the instalment quarter; and

       * (b) results in an amount (including a nil amount) being included:

         * (i) under section 3010 of that Act in your *mining revenue for a *mining project interest for the MRRT year; or

         * (ii) under section 7040 of that Act in your *premining revenue for a *premining project interest for the MRRT year.

          * Note 1: Special rules affect the calculation of instalment income for project interests that are transferred or split: see Subdivision 115G.

          * Note 2: If you have chosen to use the alternative valuation method under Division 175 of the _Minerals Resource Rent Tax Act 2012_, your unadjusted revenue amounts under section 17530 of that Act will be the same as the amounts worked out under column 2 of the table in subsection 3025(2) of that Act.

##### 11545  Meaning of applicable instalment rate

     * (1) Your **_applicable instalment rate_**, for an *instalment quarter in an *MRRT year (the **_current year_**), is worked out using the first applicable item in the table.

          * Note: If you choose a rate under Subdivision 115D, you must use it for the rest of the MRRT year even if the Commissioner later gives you a different instalment rate.

     * Nil rate determinations

     * (2) The Commissioner may, by giving you written notice, determine a nil rate for you for an *MRRT year if, in the Commissioner's opinion, you are unlikely to be liable to pay *MRRT for the MRRT year.

     * (3) The Commissioner may, by legislative instrument, determine a nil rate for a class of entities for an *MRRT year if, in the Commissioner's opinion, each entity in the class is unlikely to be liable to pay *MRRT for the MRRT year.

     * (4) A determination applies for the *instalment quarter in which the Commissioner makes it, and for later quarters in the *MRRT year.

          * Note: The determination does not apply in later MRRT years.

     * (5) However, if the Commissioner later gives you an instalment rate under Subdivision 115E, the determination stops applying to you for the instalment quarter in which you are given that later rate, and for later quarters.

          * Note 1: This may mean the nil rate determination does not apply to you for any instalment quarter (if the Commissioner makes the determination, then _later_ in the same quarter gives you an instalment rate under Subdivision 115E).

          * Note 2: For whether the rate the Commissioner gives you under Subdivision 115E is your **_applicable instalment rate_** for an instalment quarter, see the table in subsection (1).

##### Choosing an instalment rate

##### 11550  Choosing a varied instalment rate

     * You may choose an instalment rate for an *instalment quarter in an *MRRT year under this Subdivision.

          * Note 1: If choosing a rate leads you to pay an instalment that is too low, you may be liable to general interest charge under section 11565.

          * Note 2: You would also use this rate for later instalment quarters in the MRRT year, unless you choose another rate for the later instalment quarter under this section (see section 11545).

          * Note 3: Division 119 is about choices under the MRRT law.

##### 11555  Notifying Commissioner of varied instalment rate

     * (1) If you choose an instalment rate for an *instalment quarter under section 11550, you must notify the Commissioner of the rate.

     * (2) You must notify the Commissioner in the *approved form and on or before the day the instalment for the *instalment quarter is due (regardless of whether it is paid).

          * Note: The Commissioner may combine this approved form with the approved form for the notice you are required to give under section 11515: see subsection 38850(2).

##### Variation credits

##### 11560  Credit on using varied rate in certain cases

     * (1) You are entitled to claim a credit if:

       * (a) you are liable to pay an instalment for an *instalment quarter (the **_current quarter_**) in an *MRRT year; and

       * (b) the amount of your instalment for the current quarter is to be worked out using an instalment rate you chose under section 11550; and

       * (c) that rate is lower than your *applicable instalment rate for the previous quarter in the same year; and

       * (d) the amount worked out using the method statement is greater than nil.

Method statement

         * Step 1.	Add up the instalments you are liable to pay for the earlier *instalment quarters in the year (even if you have not yet paid all of them).

         * Step 2.	Subtract from the step 1 amount each earlier credit that you have claimed under this section or section 115100 in respect of the year.

         * Step 3.	Multiply the total of your *instalment income for those earlier *instalment quarters by your *applicable instalment rate for the current quarter.

         * Step 4.	Subtract the step 3 amount from the step 2 amount.

         * Step 5.	If the result is a positive amount, it is the amount of the credit you can claim.

          * Example: In the first instalment quarter in an MRRT year, a miner has instalment income of $100m and an applicable instalment rate of 15%, which has been given by the Commissioner.

          * In the second instalment quarter in the MRRT year, the miner has instalment income of $80m and uses the same rate given by the Commissioner (15%).

          * In the third instalment quarter in the MRRT year, the miner has instalment income of $70m and chooses an instalment rate of 12%.

          * The miner uses the method statement to work out a credit as follows: 

          *  Step 1: The instalment of $15m for the first instalment quarter ($100m x 15%), plus the instalment of $12m for the second instalment quarter ($80m x 15%) gives a total step 1 amount of $27m.

          *  Step 2: No earlier credits have been claimed, so there is no amount to subtract from the step 1 amount--the step 2 amount is $27m.

          *  Step 3: The total of the instalment income for the earlier quarters is $180m, multiplied by the rate for the current quarter (12%), equals $21.6m.

          *  Step 4: $27m  $21.6m = $5.4m.

          *  Step 5: The miner has a credit of $5.4m.

          * The miner also has an instalment liability for the current quarter of $8.4m ($70m x 12%).

          * After applying the $5.4m credit, the miner will be liable to pay an amount of $3m for the quarter.

     * (2) A claim for a credit must be made in the *approved form on or before the day on which the instalment for the current quarter is due.

          * Note: How the credit is applied is set out in Division 3 of Part IIB.

     * (3) The credit entitlement does not affect your liability to pay an instalment.

##### General interest charge payable in certain cases if instalments are too low

##### 11565  Liability to GIC on shortfall in instalments worked out on the basis of varied rate

     * (1) You are liable to pay the *general interest charge under this section if:

       * (a) an instalment rate (the **_varied rate_**) you choose under section 11550 is your *applicable instalment rate for an *instalment quarter (the **_variation quarter_**) in an *MRRT year; and

       * (b) the varied rate is less than 85% of your *benchmark instalment rate for the MRRT year.

          * Note: For the Commissioner's power to remit general interest charge, see section 8AAG.

     * (2) You are liable to pay the *general interest charge on the amount worked out as follows:

     * where: 

     * **_credit adjustment_** means:

       * (a) if, as a result of using the varied rate for the variation quarter, you claimed a credit under section 11560--the amount worked out as follows:

       * or the sum of the amounts of the credits, whichever is less; and

       * (b) otherwise--nil.

     * **_rate discrepancy_** means the difference between the varied rate and the lesser of:

       * (a) the rate that would have been your *applicable instalment rate for the variation quarter if you did not choose an instalment rate for the variation quarter or an earlier *instalment quarter in the *MRRT year; and

       * (b) your *benchmark instalment rate for that MRRT year.

     * (3) You are liable to pay the charge for each day in the period that:

       * (a) started at the beginning of the day by which the instalment for the variation quarter was due to be paid; and

       * (b) finishes at the end of the day on which your *assessed MRRT for the *MRRT year is due to be paid.

     * (4) The Commissioner must give you written notice of the *general interest charge to which you are liable under subsection (2). You must pay the charge within 14 days after the notice is given to you.

     * (5) If any of the *general interest charge to which you are liable under subsection (2) remains unpaid at the end of the 14 days referred to in subsection (4), you are also liable to pay the general interest charge on the unpaid amount for each day in the period that:

       * (a) starts at the end of those 14 days; and

       * (b) finishes at the end of the last day on which, at the end of the day, any of the following remains unpaid:

         * (i) the unpaid amount;

         * (ii) general interest charge on the unpaid amount.

##### 11570  Working out your benchmark instalment rate

     * Your **_benchmark instalment rate_** for an *MRRT year is the percentage worked out to 2 decimal places (rounding up if the third decimal place is 5 or more) using the formula:

     * However, your **_benchmark instalment rate_** for the MRRT year is a nil rate if either component of the fraction is nil.

##### Subdivision 115E--Instalment rate given to you by Commissioner

##### Table of sections

        * 11575	Commissioner instalment rate for MRRT

        * 11580	Commissioner may take changes, and proposed changes, to the law into account

##### 11575  Commissioner instalment rate for MRRT

     * (1) The Commissioner may give you an instalment rate from time to time, by giving you written notice of:

       * (a) the instalment rate; and

       * (b) the modified MRRT liability, as worked out under subsection (2), for the purposes of working out the instalment rate.

          * Note: For whether the rate the Commissioner gives you is your **_applicable instalment rate_** for an instalment quarter, see section 11545.

     * (2) An instalment rate that the Commissioner gives you must be the percentage worked out to 2 decimal places (rounding up if the third decimal place is 5 or more) using the formula:

     * where: 

     * **_modified liability for MRRT _**is the amount of *MRRT you are liable to pay for the *base year, subject to section 11580.

          * Note: The instalment rate worked out under this subsection could exceed the MRRT rate. One reason for this is that not all amounts of mining revenue are included in instalment income.

     * **_	_**(3)	The **_base year_** is the most recent *MRRT year for which an assessment of *MRRT has been made for you.

     * (4) However, the instalment rate must be a nil rate if either component of the fraction is nil.

     * (5) Despite subsections (2) to (4), the Commissioner may give you an instalment rate worked out on a different basis if, having regard to the object of this Division and the circumstances, the Commissioner is of the opinion:

       * (a) that it would be reasonable to work out the rate under this subsection; and

       * (b) that the rate so worked out is reasonable.

          * Example: The following are some examples of circumstances in which a rate may be worked out on a different basis:

           * (a) an entity joins or leaves a consolidated group;

           * (b) a mining project interest is transferred or split;

           *  	(c) there is no base year for the mining project interest;

           * (d) there was a significant amount of oneoff capital expenditure in the base year;

           * (e) MRRT allowances applied in a later year are expected to be significantly less than MRRT allowances applied in the base year;

           * (f) there is a change in the economic circumstances of the mining industry.

     * (6) To avoid doubt, an instalment rate the Commissioner works out under subsection (5) may be higher, or lower, than the rate worked out under subsection (2) (if a rate can be worked out under that subsection).

##### 11580  Commissioner may take changes, and proposed changes, to the law into account

     * For the purposes of working out your modified liability for *MRRT for a *base year, the Commissioner may work out an amount:

       * (a) as if provisions of an Act or regulations, as they may reasonably be expected to apply for the purposes of your assessment for a later *MRRT year, had applied for the purposes of the base year; and

       * (b) as if provisions of an Act or regulations had applied for the purposes of the base year if:

         * (i) in the Commissioner's opinion, the provisions are likely to be enacted or made; and

         * (ii) the application of the provisions reduces the instalment rate being given to you.

          * Note: Taking law changes, and proposed law changes, into account in working out the instalment rate means total instalments for the year are as close as possible to your likely MRRT for the year.

        * 11585	Default instalment rate

##### 11585  Default instalment rate

     * Instalment rate for instalment income relating to iron ore

     * (1) The rate that applies to you for an *instalment quarter in which your *instalment income only includes amounts relating to iron ore is:

       * (a) if paragraph (b) does not apply--8%; or

       * (b) if the regulations prescribe a rate for the instalment quarter for the purposes of this subsection--that rate.

     * Instalment rate for instalment income relating to other taxable resources

     * (2) The rate that applies to you for an *instalment quarter in which your *instalment income only includes amounts relating to *taxable resources other than iron ore, is:

       * (a) if paragraph (b) does not apply--3%; or

       * (b) if the regulations prescribe a rate for the instalment quarter for the purposes of this subsection--that rate.

     * Instalment rate for instalment income relating to iron ore and other taxable resources

     * (3) The rate that applies to you for an *instalment quarter in which your *instalment income includes amounts relating both to iron ore and to other *taxable resources is the sum of the following, worked out to 2 decimal places (rounding up if the third decimal place is 5 or more):

       * (a) the rate that would apply for the quarter if your instalment income only included amounts relating to iron ore, multiplied by the proportion of your total instalment income for the quarter that relates to iron ore;

       * (b) the rate that would apply for the quarter if your instalment income only included amounts relating to taxable resources other than iron ore, multiplied by the proportion of your total instalment income for the quarter that relates to taxable resources other than iron ore.

          * Example: In an instalment quarter, you have $200m in instalment income from mining project interests that relate to iron ore, and $100m in instalment income from mining project interests that relate to coal.

          * Under subsection (1), the default instalment rate for iron ore is 8%, and under subsection (2) the default instalment rate for coal is 3%.

          * The rate that applies to you for the quarter is 6.33% [(.08 x 200m/300m) + (.03 x 100m/300m)].

     * Regulations not to be made in first MRRT year

     * (4) The regulations may prescribe a rate for the purposes of subsection (1) or (2) for an *instalment quarter in the 20132014 *MRRT year or a later year.

     * (1) In working out, under section 11540, your *instalment income for an *instalment quarter that ends before a *mining project transfer, *mining project split, *premining project transfer or *premining project split happens:

       * (a) include amounts that:

         * (i) relate to *mining revenue events that happen during the instalment quarter; and

         * (ii) would, apart from the application of Division 120, 125, 145 or 150 of the _Minerals Resource Rent Tax Act 2012_ in relation to the transfer or split, be included in your *mining revenue or *premining revenue as mentioned in section 11540; and

       * (b) do not include amounts that:

         * (i) relate to mining revenue events that happen during the instalment quarter; and

         * (ii) are included in your mining revenue or premining revenue as mentioned in section 11540 only because of the application of those Divisions in relation to the transfer or split.

          * Note 1: For the original miner or explorer (paragraph (a) case):

           * (a) a credit may be available under section 115100; and

           * (b) the effect of paragraph (a) is modified in some circumstances: see section 115105.

          * Note 2: For the new miner or explorer (paragraph (b) case), additional "catch up" instalment income may be included in the quarter in which the transfer or split happens: see section 11595.

     * Instalment quarter in which transfer or split happens--instalment income transfers with interest

     * (2) In working out, under section 11540, your *instalment income for an *instalment quarter in which a *mining project transfer, *mining project split, *premining project transfer or *premining project split happens:

       * (a) include amounts that:

         * (i) relate to *mining revenue events that happen during the instalment quarter; and

         * (ii) because of the application of Division 120, 125, 145 or 150 of the _Minerals Resource Rent Tax Act 2012_ in relation to the transfer or split, are included in your *mining revenue or *premining revenue as mentioned in section 11540; and

       * (b) do not include amounts that:

         * (i) relate to mining revenue events that happen during the instalment quarter; and

         * (ii) because of the application of those Divisions in relation to the transfer or split, are not included in your mining revenue or premining revenue as mentioned in section 11540.

##### 11595  Additional instalment income for new miner or new explorer

     * (1) Your **_instalment income_** for an *instalment quarter in an *MRRT year includes an amount worked out under subsection (2) if:

       * (a) a *mining project transfer, *mining project split, *premining project transfer or *premining project split happens in the instalment quarter; and

       * (b) you have the relevant *mining project interest or *premining project interest after the transfer or split.

     * (2) The amount is the sum of the amounts worked out under column 2 of the table in subsection 3025(2) of the _Minerals Resource Rent Tax Act 2012_ for each *mining revenue event that:

       * (a) happens before the start of the *instalment quarter in which the transfer or split happens; and

       * (b) because of the application of Division 120, 125, 145 or 150 of the _Minerals Resource Rent Tax Act 2012_ in relation to the transfer or split, results in an amount (including a nil amount) being included in your *mining revenue or *premining revenue as mentioned in section 11540.

          * Note 1: The additional instalment income amount is nil if the transfer or split happens in the first quarter of an MRRT year, and the miner or explorer that has the interest before the transfer or split has the same MRRT year as each miner or explorer that has the interest after the transfer or split.

          * Note 2: For the instalment quarter in which the transfer or split happens, instalment income from before the transfer or split is included under subsection 11590(2).

##### 115100  Credit for original miner or original explorer for instalment quarters before transfer or split

     * (1) You are entitled to claim a credit if:

       * (a) a *mining project transfer, *mining project split, *premining project transfer or *premining project split happens in relation to a *mining project interest or *premining project interest in an *instalment quarter in an *MRRT year; and

       * (b) your *instalment income for an earlier instalment quarter in the MRRT year for which you are liable to pay an instalment includes one or more amounts relating to the mining project interest; and

       * (c) the amount worked out using the method statement is greater than nil.

Method statement

         * Step 1.	Add up the instalments you are liable to pay for the earlier *instalment quarters in the year (even if you have not yet paid all of them).

         * Step 2.	Subtract from the step 1 amount each earlier credit that you have claimed under this section or section 11560 in respect of the year.

         * Step 3.	For each earlier *instalment quarter in the year, work out your *instalment income under section 11540 without including amounts that:

          * (a) relate to *mining revenue events that happen during the instalment quarter; and

          * (b) because of the application of Division 120, 125, 145 or 150 of the _Minerals Resource Rent Tax Act 2012_ in relation to a transfer or split, are not included in your *mining revenue or *premining revenue as mentioned in section 11540.

            * Note: Step 3 effectively recalculates instalment income disregarding paragraph 11590(1)(a).

         * Step 4.	Multiply the step 3 amount by your *applicable instalment rate for that quarter.

         * Step 5.	Sum the amounts worked out under step 4.

         * Step 6.	Subtract the step 5 amount from the step 2 amount.

         * Step 7.	If the result is a positive amount, it is the amount of the credit you can claim.

     * Claim to be made in approved form

     * (2) A claim for a credit must be made in the *approved form on or before the day on which the instalment for the current quarter is due.

##### 115105  Adjusted instalment income for original miners or explorers

     * (1) Despite subsection 11590(1), the provisions mentioned in subsection (2) have effect as if your *instalment income for an *instalment quarter that ends before a *mining project transfer, *mining project split, *premining project transfer or *premining project split happens did not include amounts that:

       * (a) relate to *mining revenue events that happen during the instalment quarter; and

       * (b) because of the application of Division 120, 125, 145 or 150 of the _Minerals Resource Rent Tax Act 2012_ in relation to the transfer or split, are not included in your *mining revenue or *premining revenue as mentioned in section 11540.

          * Note: Subsection (1) effectively recalculates instalment income disregarding paragraph 11590(1)(a).

     * (2) The provisions are:

       * (a) subsection 11565(2) (about GIC on instalment shortfalls); and

       * (b) section 11570 (about your benchmark instalment rate for an *MRRT year); and

       * (c) subsection 11575(2) (about working out a Commissioner instalment rate).
