#### Division 2A--Exceptional claims indemnity scheme

##### Subdivision A--Introduction

##### 34A  Guide to the exceptional claims indemnity provisions

    * (1) This Division provides that an exceptional claims indemnity may be paid in relation to a liability of a person if:

     * (a) the liability relates to a claim against the person in relation to an incident that occurs in the course of, or in connection with, the practice by the person of a medical profession (other than practice as an eligible midwife), being a claim that has been certified as a qualifying claim; and

     * (b) the liability exceeds the amount payable under an insurance contract that has a contract limit satisfying the relevant threshold.

    * (2) This Division also provides for the determination of an Exceptional Claims Protocol that can deal with other matters relating to claims that have been certified as qualifying claims.

    * (3) The following table tells you where to find the provisions dealing with various issues:

##### 34B  Definitions

    * In this Division: 

    * **_practitioner's contract limit_**, in relation to a person for whom a contract of insurance provides medical indemnity cover, means the maximum amount payable, in aggregate, by the insurer under the contract in relation to claims against the person.

        * Note 1: If the contract provides medical indemnity cover for more than one person, there must be a separate contract limit for each of those persons.

        * Note 2: For how this definition applies if the contract provides for deductibles, see section 34C.

        * Note 3: For how this definition interacts with the high cost claim indemnity scheme, see section 34D.

    * **_qualifying liability_**, in relation to a claim, has the meaning given by section 34M.

    * **_termination date _**means the date, if any, set by regulations under section 34G.

##### 34C  Treatment of deductibles

    * (1) This section applies if, under a contract of insurance that provides medical indemnity cover for a person (the **_practitioner_**), the insurer is entitled to count an amount (the **_deductible amount_**):

     * (a) incurred by the insurer in relation to a claim against the practitioner; or

     * (b) paid or payable by the practitioner or another person in relation to a claim against the practitioner;

    * towards the maximum amount payable, in aggregate, under the contract in relation to claims against the practitioner, even though the insurer has not paid, and is not liable to pay, the amount under the contract.

    * (2) For the purpose of the definition of **_practitioner's contract limit _**in section 34B, the maximum amount payable, in aggregate, under the contract in relation to claims against the practitioner is as stated in the contract, even though the insurer (because of the deductible amount) may not actually be liable to pay the whole of that maximum amount.

    * (3) For the purpose of the references in paragraphs 34L(1)(e) and (f) to an amount that an insurer has paid or is liable to pay under a contract of insurance, the deductible amount is to be counted as if it were an amount that the insurer has paid or is liable to pay under the contract.

    * (4) However, for the purpose of the reference in paragraph 34L(1)(e) to an amount that an insurer would have been liable to pay under a contract of insurance, the deductible amount is not to be counted as if it were an amount that the insurer would have been liable to pay under the contract.

##### 34D  Interaction with high cost claim indemnity scheme and runoff cover indemnity scheme

    * For the purposes of the definition of **_practitioner's contract limit _**in section 34B, and of paragraphs 34L(1)(e) and (f), an amount that an insurer has paid or is liable to pay, or would have been liable to pay, under a contract of insurance is not to be reduced on account of a high cost claim indemnity, or a runoff cover indemnity, paid or payable, or that would have been payable, to the insurer.

##### Subdivision C--Exceptional claims indemnity

##### 34L  When is an exceptional claims indemnity payable?

    * Criteria for payment of indemnity

    * (1) The Chief Executive Medicare may decide that an exceptional claims indemnity is payable in relation to a liability of a person (the **_practitioner_**) if:

     * (a) a claim for compensation or damages (the **_current claim_**) is, or was, made against the practitioner by another person; and

     * (b) a qualifying claim certificate is in force in relation to the current claim; and

     * (c) the liability is a qualifying liability of the practitioner in relation to the current claim (see section 34M); and

     * (d) because of the practitioner's contract limit in relation to the contract of insurance identified in the qualifying claim certificate, the contract does not cover, or does not fully cover, the liability; and

     * (e) the amount that, if the practitioner's contract limit had been high enough to cover the whole of the liability, the insurer would (subject to the other terms and conditions of the contract) have been liable to pay under the contract of insurance in relation to the liability exceeds the actual amount (if any) that the insurer has paid or is liable to pay under the contract in relation to the liability; and

     * (f) the aggregate of:

      * (i) the amount (if any) the insurer has paid, or is liable to pay, in relation to the liability under the contract of insurance; and

      * (ii) the other amounts (if any) that the insurer has already paid, or has already become liable to pay, under the contract in relation to the current claim; and

      * (iii) the amounts (if any) that the insurer has already paid, or has already become liable to pay, under the contract in relation to other claims against the practitioner (being other claims that were first notified to the insurer no later than the time the current claim was notified to the insurer);

     * equals or exceeds the relevant threshold identified in the qualifying claim certificate; and

     * (g) a person has applied for the indemnity in accordance with section 37A.

        * Note 1: For how paragraphs (e) and (f) apply if there are deductibles, see section 34C.

        * Note 2: For how paragraphs (e) and (f) interact with the high cost claim indemnity scheme, see section 34D.

        * Note 3: For the purpose of subparagraphs (f)(i) and (ii), payments and liabilities to pay must meet the ordinary course of business requirement set out in subsection (3).

        * Note 4: For how paragraphs (e) and (f) apply if the insurer is an externallyadministered body corporate, see subsection (4).

        * Note 5: For how paragraphs (e) and (f) apply if the claim relates to a series of incidents some, but not all, of which occurred in the course of the provision of treatment to a public patient in a public hospital, see section 34N.

        * Note 6: For how paragraphs (e) and (f) apply if the claim relates to a series of incidents some, but not all, of which occurred after the termination date, see section 34O.

    * Who the indemnity is payable to

    * (2) The indemnity is to be paid to the person who applies for it.

        * Note: For who can apply, see section 37A.

    * Ordinary course of business test for insurance payments

    * (3) An amount that an insurer has paid, or is liable to pay, under a contract of insurance does not count for the purpose of subparagraph (1)(f)(i) or (ii) unless it is an amount that the insurer paid, or is liable to pay, in the ordinary course of the insurer's business.

    * What if the insurer is an externallyadministered body corporate?

    * (4) If an insurer is an externallyadministered body corporate:

     * (a) a reference in paragraphs (1)(e) and (f) to an amount that the insurer is liable to pay under a contract of insurance is a reference to an amount that the insurer is liable to pay under the contract and that is a provable amount; and

     * (b) a reference in subsection (3) to an amount that an insurer is liable to pay in the ordinary course of the insurer's business is a reference to an amount that the insurer is liable to pay, and would be able to pay in the ordinary course of the insurer's business if it were not an externallyadministered body corporate.

    * AAT review of decision to refuse, or to pay a particular amount of indemnity

    * (5) An application may be made to the Administrative Appeals Tribunal for review of a decision of the Chief Executive Medicare to refuse an application for exceptional claims indemnity, or a decision of the Chief Executive Medicare to pay a particular amount of exceptional claims indemnity.

        * Note: Section 27A of the _Administrative Appeals Tribunal Act 1975_ requires notification of a decision that is reviewable.

##### 34M  Qualifying liabilities

    * (1) A person (the **_practitioner_**) has a **_qualifying liability_** in relation to a claim made against the person if:

     * (a) one of the following applies:

      * (i) the liability is under a judgment or order of a court in relation to the claim, being a judgment or order that is not stayed and is not subject to appeal;

      * (ii) the liability is under a settlement of the claim that takes the form of a written agreement between the parties to the claim;

      * (iii) the liability is some other kind of liability of the practitioner (for example, a liability to legal costs) that relates to the claim; and

     * (b) the defence of the claim against the practitioner was conducted appropriately (see subsection (2)) up to the time when:

      * (i) if the liability is under a judgment or order of a court--the date on which the judgment or order became a judgment or order that is not stayed and is not subject to appeal; or

      * (ii) if the liability is under a settlement of the claim--the date on which the settlement agreement was entered into; or

      * (iii) if the liability is some other kind of liability--the date on which the liability was incurred; and

     * (c) if the liability is under a settlement of the claim, or is under a consent order made by a court--a legal practitioner has given a statutory declaration certifying that the amount of the liability is reasonable.

    * (2) For the purposes of paragraph (1)(b), the defence of the claim is **_conducted appropriately_** if, and only if:

     * (a) to the extent it is conducted on the practitioner's behalf by an insurer, or by a legal practitioner engaged by the insurer--the defence is conducted to a standard that is consistent with the insurer's usual standard for the conduct of the defence of claims; and

     * (b) to the extent it is conducted by the practitioner, or by a legal practitioner engaged by the practitioner--the defence is conducted prudently.

    * (3) In this section:

    * **_defence of the claim_** includes any settlement negotiations on behalf of the practitioner.

##### 34N  Treatment of a claim that partly relates to a public patient in a public hospital

    * If: 

     * (a) a claim against a person relates to a series of incidents; and

     * (b) some, but not all, of the incidents occurred in the course of the provision of treatment to a public patient in a public hospital;

    * then, for the purposes of applying paragraph 34L(1)(e) and subparagraphs 34L(1)(f)(i) and (ii) in relation to the claim, an amount that an insurer has paid or is liable to pay, or would have been liable to pay, in relation to the claim, is to be reduced by the extent (if any) to which the amount relates or would relate to, or is or would be reasonably attributable to, the incident or incidents that occurred in the course of the provision of treatment to a public patient in a public hospital.

##### 34O  Treatment of a claim that relates to a series of incidents some of which occurred after the termination date

    * If: 

     * (a) a claim against a person relates to a series of incidents; and

     * (b) some, but not all, of the incidents occurred after the termination date;

    * then, for the purposes of applying paragraph 34L(1)(e) and subparagraphs 34L(1)(f)(i) and (ii) in relation to the claim, an amount that an insurer has paid or is liable to pay, or would have been liable to pay, in relation to the claim, is to be reduced by the extent (if any) to which the amount relates or would relate to, or is or would be reasonably attributable to, the incident or incidents that occurred after the termination date.

##### 34P  The amount of exceptional claims indemnity that is payable

    * The amount of exceptional claims indemnity that is payable in relation to a particular qualifying liability is the amount of the excess referred to in paragraph 34L(1)(e).

        * Note: It is only liabilities that exceed the practitioner's contract limit that will be covered by an exceptional claims indemnity (even if the relevant threshold is less than that limit).

##### 34Q  How exceptional claims indemnity is to be applied

    * (1) This section applies if an exceptional claims indemnity is paid to a person (the **_recipient_**) in relation to a liability of a person (the **_practitioner_**).

        * Note: The recipient will either be the practitioner himself or herself, or a person acting on behalf of the practitioner.

    * Chief Executive Medicare to give recipient of payment a notice identifying the liability to be discharged

    * (2) The Chief Executive Medicare must give the recipient a written notice (the **_payment notice_**) identifying the liability in relation to which the indemnity is paid, and advising the recipient how this section requires the indemnity to be dealt with.

    * Recipient's obligation if the amount of the indemnity equals or is less than the liability

    * (3) If the amount of the indemnity equals or is less than the undischarged amount of the liability identified in the payment notice, the recipient must apply the whole of the indemnity towards the discharge of the liability.

    * Recipient's obligation if the amount of the indemnity exceeds the liability

    * (4) If the amount of the indemnity is greater than the undischarged amount of the liability identified in the payment notice, the recipient must:

     * (a) apply so much of the indemnity as equals the undischarged amount of the liability towards the discharge of the liability; and

     * (b) if the recipient is not the practitioner--deal with the balance of the indemnity in accordance with the directions of the practitioner.

    * Time by which recipient must comply with obligation

    * (5) The recipient must comply with whichever of subsections (3) and (4) applies:

     * (a) by the time specified in a written direction (whether contained in the payment notice or otherwise) given to the recipient by the Chief Executive Medicare; or

     * (b) if no such direction is given to the recipient--as soon as practicable after the indemnity is received by the recipient.

    * To avoid doubt, the Chief Executive Medicare may vary a direction under paragraph (a) to specify a different time.

    * Debt to Commonwealth if recipient does not comply with obligation on time

    * (6) If the recipient does not comply with whichever of subsections (3) and (4) applies by the time required by subsection (5), the amount of the indemnity is a debt due to the Commonwealth.

    * (7) The debt may be recovered:

     * (a) by action by the Chief Executive Medicare against the recipient in a court of competent jurisdiction; or

     * (b) under section 42.

    * (8) If the amount of the indemnity is recoverable, or has been recovered, as mentioned in subsection (7), no amount is recoverable under section 34T or section 41 in relation to the same payment of exceptional claims indemnity.

##### 34R  Who is liable to repay an overpayment of exceptional claims indemnity?

    * (1) This section applies if, in relation to an exceptional claims indemnity that has been paid, there is an amount overpaid as described in subsection 34T(2) or 41(2).

    * (2) The **_liable person_**, in relation to the amount overpaid, is:

     * (a) if the indemnity has not yet been dealt with in accordance with whichever of subsections 34Q(3) and (4) applies--the recipient referred to in subsection 34Q(1); or

     * (b) if the indemnity has been dealt with in accordance with whichever of those subsections applies--the practitioner referred to in subsection 34Q(1).

        * Note: The recipient and the practitioner will be the same person if the indemnity was paid to the practitioner.

    * (3) If:

     * (a) the recipient and the practitioner referred to in subsection 34Q(1) are not the same person; and

     * (b) when the overpayment is recovered as a debt, the liable person is the recipient;

    * the fact that the recipient may later deal with the remainder of the indemnity in accordance with subsection 34Q(3) or (4) does not mean that the overpayment should instead have been recovered from the practitioner.

##### Subdivision D--Payments that would have reduced the amount paid out under the contract of insurance

##### 34S  Amounts paid before payment of exceptional claims indemnity

    * (1) If:

     * (a) an amount (the **_insurance payment_**) has been paid under a contract of insurance that provides medical indemnity cover for a person (the **_practitioner_**) in relation to a liability of the practitioner; and

     * (b) another amount (not being an amount referred to in subsection (2)) has been paid to the practitioner, the insurer or another person in relation to the incident or incidents to which the liability relates; and

     * (c) the other amount was not taken into account in working out the amount of the insurance payment; and

     * (d) if the other amount had been taken into account in working out the amount of the insurance payment, a lesser amount would have been paid under the contract of insurance in relation to the liability;

    * then, for the purpose of calculating the amount of exceptional claims indemnity (if any) that is payable in relation to a liability of the practitioner, the lesser amount is taken to have been the amount of the insurance payment.

    * (2) This section does not apply to any of the following:

     * (a) an amount paid to an insurer by another insurer under a right of contribution;

     * (b) a payment of high cost claim indemnity;

##### 34T  Amounts paid after payment of exceptional claims indemnity

    * (1) This section applies if:

     * (a) an amount (the **_actual indemnity amount_**) of exceptional claims indemnity has been paid in relation to a qualifying liability that relates to a claim made against a person (the **_practitioner_**); and

     * (b) another amount (not being an amount referred to in subsection (5)) is paid to the practitioner, an insurer or another person in relation to the incident or incidents to which the claim relates, or in relation to one or more other incidents; and

     * (c) the other amount was not taken into account in calculating the actual indemnity amount; and

     * (d) if the other amount had been so taken into account, a lesser amount (the **_reduced indemnity amount_**, which could be zero) of exceptional claims indemnity would have been paid in relation to the liability.

    * (2) The **_amount overpaid_** is the amount by which the actual indemnity amount exceeds the reduced indemnity amount.

    * (3) If the Chief Executive Medicare has given the liable person (see subsection 34R(2)) a notice under subsection 34V(1) in relation to the amount overpaid, the amount is a debt owed to the Commonwealth by the liable person.

        * Note 1: If the indemnity is or was not dealt with in accordance with whichever of subsections 34Q(3) and (4) applies by the time required by subsection 34Q(5), the whole amount of the indemnity is a debt owed by the recipient, and no amount is recoverable under this section (see subsections 34Q(6) to (8)).

        * Note 2: If:

         * (a) the recipient and the practitioner referred to in subsection 34Q(1) are not the same person; and

         * (b) the practitioner becomes the liable person;

        * then (subject to subsection 34R(3)), the recipient ceases to be the liable person, and the amount overpaid must instead be recovered from the practitioner.

    * (4) The amount overpaid may be recovered:

     * (a) by action by the Chief Executive Medicare against the liable person in a court of competent jurisdiction; or

     * (b) under section 42.

    * (5) This section does not apply to any of the following:

     * (a) an amount paid to an insurer by another insurer under a right of contribution;

     * (b) a payment of high cost claim indemnity;

     * (b) the person (the **_applicant_**) who applied for the exceptional claims indemnity becomes aware that another amount has been paid to the practitioner, an insurer or another person in relation to the incident or incidents to which the claim relates, or in relation to one or more other incidents; and

     * (c) because of the payment of the other amount, there is an amount overpaid as described in subsection 34T(2);

    * the applicant must notify the Chief Executive Medicare that the other amount has been paid.

        * Note: Failure to notify is an offence (see section 46).

    * (2) The notification must:

     * (a) be in writing; and

     * (b) be given to the Chief Executive Medicare within 28 days after the applicant becomes aware that the other amount has been paid.

    * the Chief Executive Medicare may give the liable person (see subsection 34R(2)) a written notice that specifies:

     * (d) the amount overpaid, and that it is a debt owed to the Commonwealth under subsection 34T(3); and

     * (e) the day before which the amount must be paid to the Commonwealth; and

     * (f) the effect of section 34W.

    * The day specified under paragraph (e) must be at least 28 days after the day on which the notice is given.

    * (2) The debt becomes due and payable on the day specified under paragraph (1)(e).

     * (c) the other amount was not taken into account in working out the amount of the indemnity payment; and

     * (d) if the other amount had been taken into account in working out the amount of the indemnity payment, a lesser amount would have been paid under the arrangement with the MDO, or under the contract of insurance, in relation to the liability;

     * (a) an amount paid to a medical indemnity insurer by another insurer under a right of contribution;

     * (b) a payment of high cost claim indemnity;

     * (d) if the other amount had been so taken into account, a lesser amount (the **_reduced runoff cover amount_**, which could be zero) of runoff cover indemnity would have been paid in relation to the liability.

    * (2) The **_amount overpaid_** is the amount by which the actual runoff cover amount exceeds the reduced runoff cover amount.

    * (3) If the Chief Executive Medicare has given an MDO or a medical indemnity insurer a notice under subsection 34ZL(1) in relation to the amount overpaid, the amount is a debt owed to the Commonwealth by the MDO or insurer.

     * (a) by action by the Chief Executive Medicare against the MDO or insurer in a court of competent jurisdiction; or

     * (b) under section 42.

##### Subdivision E--Effect of terminating the runoff cover indemnity scheme

##### 's obligations on termination of the runoff cover indemnity scheme

    * (1) If a termination date for the runoff cover indemnity scheme has been set (see subsection 34ZB(3)), the Commonwealth is liable to pay an amount in accordance with this Subdivision in relation to each affected medical practitioner.

    * (2) However, this section does not apply if:

     * (a) the Minister, by legislative instrument, determines that alternative arrangements for providing medical cover for medical practitioners in relation to eligible runoff claims will apply on and from the termination date; and

     * (b) the determination is made on or before the termination date.

##### 34ZQ  Affected medical practitioners

    * A medical practitioner is an **_affected medical practitioner_** if:

     * (a) a termination date for the runoff cover indemnity scheme has been set (see subsection 34ZB(3)); and

     * (b) prior to the termination date, one or more premiums have been paid for medical indemnity cover, for the medical practitioner, in relation to one or more periods totalling at least 12 months; and

     * (c) immediately before the termination date, the medical practitioner was not a person to whom subsection 34ZB(2) applies.

##### 34ZR  Payments in relation to affected medical practitioners

    * (1) A payment that the Commonwealth is liable to make in relation to an affected medical practitioner:

     * (a) must be paid to a person who:

      * (i) is nominated by the practitioner; and

      * (ii) has, on or after the termination date, provided medical indemnity cover for the practitioner under a contract of insurance; and

     * (b) must be paid as all or part of the premium payable for the provision of that cover; and

     * (c) must be paid within 12 months after the termination date; and

     * (d) must not exceed the practitioner's total runoff cover credit.

    * (2) Amounts payable by the Commonwealth under this Subdivision are payable out of the Consolidated Revenue Fund, which is appropriated accordingly.

##### 34ZS  Total runoff cover credits

    * (1) This is how to work out an affected practitioner's total runoff cover credit:

      * _Method statement_

      * _Step 1.	For the first financial year after 30 June 2004 in which a medical indemnity insurer provided medical indemnity cover for the practitioner under a contract of insurance, multiply:

        * (a) the practitioner's runoff cover credit for the financial year; by

        * (b) the interest rate adjustment for the financial year (see subsection (4)).

      * Step 2.	For each subsequent financial year (if any) until the financial year in which the termination date occurs, multiply:

        * (a) the sum of the practitioner's runoff cover credit for the financial year and the amount worked out, under Step 1 or this Step, for the immediately preceding financial year; by

        * (b) the interest rate adjustment for the financial year (see subsection (4)).

      * Step 3.	Add together:

        * (a) the practitioner's runoff cover credit for the financial year in which the termination date occurs; and

        * (b) the last of the amounts worked out under Step 1 or Step 2.

      * The result is the practitioner's **_total runoff cover credit_**.

    * (2) The practitioner's **_runoff cover credit _**for a financial year is the sum of all runoff cover support payments paid or payable to the extent that they are attributable, under subsection (3), to the practitioner in relation to the financial year.

    * (3) Runoff cover support payments are **_attributable_** to the practitioner in relation to the financial year to the extent that they relate to premiums paid during the financial year to a medical indemnity insurer for medical indemnity cover provided for the practitioner by one or more contracts of insurance with the insurer.

    * (4) The **_interest rate adjustment_** for a financial year is the number worked out as follows:

    * where: 

    * **_applicable interest rate_** is:

     * (a) the rate of interest, for the financial year, specified in the regulations for the purposes of this paragraph; or

     * (b) if no rate is so specified--the shortterm bond rate for the June quarter immediately preceding the financial year.

    * **_June quarter_** means a period of 3 months commencing on 1 April.

    * **_shortterm bond rate_**, for a June quarter, means:

     * (a) if:

      * (i) the Reserve Bank of Australia has published, in respect of one or more days in the last 2 weeks of the quarter, an indicative secondary market midrate yield for Australian Government fixed coupon Treasury bonds; and

      * (ii) the maturity date of the bonds is the third anniversary of the 15th day of the quarter or (if there are no bonds with that maturity date) the closer or closest date to that date within 2 years after it;

     * the yield referred to in subparagraph (i) in respect of the day referred to in that subparagraph, or the average of the yields referred to in subparagraph (i) in respect of the days referred to in that subparagraph, as the case requires; or

     * (b) in any other case--the rate of interest notified in the _Gazette_, by the Minister administering the _Loan (Income Equalization Deposits) Act 1976_, as the rate of interest in relation to the quarter for the purposes of this definition.

##### 34ZT  Medical indemnity insurers must provide information attributing runoff cover payments

     * (a) each medical practitioner to whom the payment is attributable; and

     * (b) for each such practitioner, each financial year in relation to which the payment is attributable; and

     * (c) for each such practitioner and financial year, the extent to which the payment is attributable to the practitioner in relation to the financial year.

        * Note: Failure to notify is an offence (see section 46).
