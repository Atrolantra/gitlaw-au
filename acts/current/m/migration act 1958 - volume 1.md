        * Note: This section commenced, and subsection 36(1) was repealed, on the commencement of Part 1 of Schedule 2 to the _Migration and Maritime Powers Legislation Amendment (Resolving the Asylum Legacy Caseload) Act 2014_.

    * (6) The criteria for a class of protection visas are:

     * (a) the criteria set out in section 36; and

     * (a) both of the criteria in subsections (1B) and (1C); and

     * (b) at least one of the criteria in subsection (2).

    * (1B) A criterion for a protection visa is that the applicant is not assessed by the Australian Security Intelligence Organisation to be directly or indirectly a risk to security (within the meaning of section 4 of the _Australian Security Intelligence Organisation Act 1979_).

    * (1C) A criterion for a protection visa is that the applicant is not a person whom the Minister considers, on reasonable grounds:

     * (a) is a danger to Australia's security; or

     * (b) having been convicted by a final judgment of a particularly serious crime, is a danger to the Australian community.

        * Note: For paragraph (b), see section 5M.

    * (2) A criterion for a protection visa is that the applicant for the visa is:

     * (a) a noncitizen in  in respect of whom the Minister is satisfied  has protection obligations because the person is a refugee; or

     * (aa) a noncitizen in Australia (other than a noncitizen mentioned in paragraph (a)) in respect of whom the Minister is satisfied Australia has protection obligations because the Minister has substantial grounds for believing that, as a necessary and foreseeable consequence of the noncitizen being removed from Australia to a receiving country, there is a real risk that the noncitizen will suffer significant harm; or

     * (b) a noncitizen in  who is a member of the same family unit as a noncitizen who:

      * (i) is mentioned in paragraph (a); and

      * (ii) holds a protection visa of the same class as that applied for by the applicant; or

     * (c) a noncitizen in Australia who is a member of the same family unit as a noncitizen who:

      * (i) is mentioned in paragraph (aa); and

      * (ii) holds a protection visa of the same class as that applied for by the applicant.

     * (d) the noncitizen will be subjected to cruel or inhuman treatment or punishment; or

     * (e) the noncitizen will be subjected to degrading treatment or punishment.

    * (2B) However, there is taken not to be a real risk that a noncitizen will suffer significant harm in a country if the Minister is satisfied that:

     * (a) it would be reasonable for the noncitizen to relocate to an area of the country where there would not be a real risk that the noncitizen will suffer significant harm; or

     * (b) the noncitizen could obtain, from an authority of the country, protection such that there would not be a real risk that the noncitizen will suffer significant harm; or

     * (c) the real risk is one faced by the population of the country generally and is not faced by the noncitizen personally.

    * Ineligibility for grant of a protection visa

    * (2C) A noncitizen is taken not to satisfy the criterion mentioned in paragraph (2)(aa) if:

     * (a) the Minister has serious reasons for considering that:

      * (i) the noncitizen has committed a crime against peace, a war crime or a crime against humanity, as defined by international instruments prescribed by the regulations; or

      * (ii) the noncitizen committed a serious nonpolitical crime before entering Australia; or

      * (iii) the noncitizen has been guilty of acts contrary to the purposes and principles of the United Nations; or

    * (4) However, subsection (3) does not apply in relation to a country in respect of which:

     * (a) the noncitizen has a wellfounded fear of being persecuted for reasons of race, religion, nationality, membership of a particular social group or political opinion; or

     * (b) the Minister has substantial grounds for believing that, as a necessary and foreseeable consequence of the noncitizen availing himself or herself of a right mentioned in subsection (3), there would be a real risk that the noncitizen will suffer significant harm in relation to the country.

    * (5) Subsection (3) does not apply in relation to a country if the noncitizen has a wellfounded fear that:

     * (a) the country will return the noncitizen to another country; and

     * (b) the noncitizen will be persecuted in that other country for reasons of race, religion, nationality, membership of a particular social group or political opinion.

    * (5A) Also, subsection (3) does not apply in relation to a country if:

     * (a) the noncitizen has a wellfounded fear that the country will return the noncitizen to another country; and

     * (b) the Minister has substantial grounds for believing that, as a necessary and foreseeable consequence of the noncitizen availing himself or herself of a right mentioned in subsection (3), there would be a real risk that the noncitizen will suffer significant harm in relation to the other country.

    * (3) The Minister may, by notice in the _Gazette_, shorten the visa period of a temporary safe haven visa so that the visa ceases to be in effect on the day specified in the notice if, in the Minister's opinion, temporary safe haven in Australia is no longer necessary for the holder of the visa because of changes of a fundamental, durable and stable nature in the country concerned.

    * (4) If a notice under subsection (3) is published in the _Gazette_, the Minister must cause a copy of the notice to be laid before each House of the Parliament within 3 sitting days of that House after the publication of the notice, together with a statement that sets out the reasons for the notice, referring in particular to the Minister's reasons for thinking that changes of a fundamental, durable and stable nature have occurred in the country concerned.

##### 39  Criterion limiting number of visas

    * (1) In spite of section 14 of the _Legislative Instruments Act 2003_, a prescribed criterion for visas of a class, other than protection visas, may be the criterion that the grant of the visa would not cause the number of visas of that class granted in a particular financial year to exceed whatever number is fixed by the Minister, by legislative instrument, as the maximum number of such visas that may be granted in that year (however the criterion is expressed).

    * (2) For the purposes of this Act, when a criterion allowed by subsection (1) prevents the grant in a financial year of any more visas of a particular class, any outstanding applications for the grant in that year of visas of that class are taken not to have been made.

     * (b) the preconversion visa has not been granted to the person, whether or not a migration decision has been made in relation to the preconversion application; and

     * (c) since the application was made, one or more of the following events has occurred:

      * (i) the requirements for making a valid application for that class of visa change;

      * (ii) the criteria for the grant of that class of visa change;

          * (b) is taken to be, and always to have been, a converted application for another type of visa made on 1 August 2014.

    * (4) Without limiting subsection (3), a conversion regulation may:

     * (a) prescribe a class or classes of preconversion visas; and

     * (b) prescribe a class of applicants for preconversion visas; and

     * (c) prescribe a time (the **_conversion time_**) when the regulation is to start to apply in relation to a preconversion application, including different conversion times depending on the occurrence of different events.

    * Visa application charge

    * (5) If an amount has been paid as the first instalment of the visa application charge for a preconversion application, then, at and after the conversion time in relation to the application:

     * (a) that payment is taken not to have been paid as the first instalment of the visa application charge for the preconversion application; and

     * (b) that payment is taken to be payment of the first instalment of the visa application charge for the converted application, even if the first instalment of the visa application charge that would otherwise be payable for the converted application is greater than the actual amount paid for the first instalment of the visa application charge for the preconversion application; and

     * (c) in a case in which the first instalment of the visa application charge payable for the converted application is less than the actual amount paid for the first instalment of the visa application charge for the preconversion application, no refund is payable in respect of the difference only for that reason.

        * Note: For the visa application charge, see sections 45A, 45B and 45C.

    * Effect on bridging visas

    * (6) For the purposes of this Act, if, immediately before the conversion time for a preconversion application, a person held a bridging visa because the preconversion application had not been finally determined, then, at and after the conversion time, the bridging visa has effect as if it had been granted because of the converted application.

    * (7) For the purposes of this Act, if, immediately before the conversion time for a preconversion application, a person had made an application for a bridging visa because of the preconversion application, but the bridging visa application had not been finally determined, then, at and after the conversion time:

     * (a) the bridging visa application is taken to have been applied for because of the converted application; and

     * (b) the bridging visa (if granted) has effect as if it were granted because of the converted application.

        * Note: This Act and the regulations would apply to a bridging visa to which subsection (6) or (7) applies, and to when the bridging visa would cease to have effect, in the same way as this Act and the regulations would apply in relation to any bridging visa.

        * For example, such a bridging visa would generally cease to be in effect under section 82 if and when the substantive visa is granted because of the converted application.

    * Conversion regulation may affect accrued rights etc.

    * (8) To avoid doubt:

     * (a) subsection 12(2) of the _Legislative Instruments Act 2003_ does not apply in relation to the effect of a conversion regulation (including a conversion regulation enacted by the Parliament); and

     * (b) subsection 7(2) of the _Acts Interpretation Act 1901_, including that subsection as applied by section 13 of the _Legislative Instruments Act 2003_, does not apply in relation to the enactment of this section or the making of a conversion regulation (including a conversion regulation enacted by the Parliament).

##### 45A  Visa application charge

    * A noncitizen who makes an application for a visa is liable to pay visa application charge if, assuming the charge were paid, the application would be a valid visa application.

##### 45B  Amount of visa application charge

    * (1) The amount of visa application charge is the amount, not exceeding the visa application charge limit, prescribed in relation to the application.

        * Note: The visa application charge limit is determined under the _Migration (Visa Application) Charge Act 1997_.

    * (2) The amount prescribed in relation to an application may be nil.

    * (3) The Minister must publish the Contributory Parent Visa Composite Index (within the meaning of the _Migration (Visa Application) Charge Act 1997_) for a financial year in the _Gazette_ before the start of the financial year.

        * Note: The Contributory Parent Visa Composite Index affects the visa application charge limit in relation to contributory parent visas (within the meaning of the _Migration (Visa Application) Charge Act 1997_).

    * (4) If the Contributory Parent Visa Composite Index for a financial year is not published as required by subsection (3), it is not to be taken, merely because of that fact, to be invalid or to be a figure other than that published by the Australian Government Actuary for the financial year.

##### 45C  Regulations about visa application charge

    * (1) The regulations may:

     * (a) provide that visa application charge may be payable in instalments; and

     * (b) specify how those instalments are to be calculated; and

     * (c) specify when instalments are payable.

    * (2) The regulations may also:

     * (a) make provision for and in relation to:

     * (a) if the person is an applicant for a protection visa--any of the following (including any of the following in digital form):

     * (c) unless subsection (3) applies to the application--give written reasons (other than nondisclosable information) why the criterion was not satisfied or the provision prevented the grant of the visa; and

     * (d) if the applicant has a right to have the decision reviewed under Part 5 or 7 or section 500--state:

     * (a) an application by the noncitizen for a visa of another class; or

     * (b) the grant of such a visa.

    * (2) To avoid doubt, the holding by a noncitizen of a bridging visa is not to be taken to be, for the purposes of an application for a visa of another class, the holding of a visa.

    * that may be granted in a specified financial year.

    * (2) Subsection (1) does not apply in relation to temporary protection visas or safe haven enterprise visas.

##### 86  Effect of limit

    * If: 

     * (a) there is a determination of the maximum number of visas of a class or classes that may be granted in a financial year; and

     * (b) the number of visas of the class or classes granted in the year reaches that maximum number;

    * no more visas of the class or classes may be granted in the year.

##### 87  Limit does not prevent visas for certain persons

    * (1) Section 86 does not prevent the grant of a visa to a person who applied for it on the ground that he or she is the spouse, de facto partner or dependent child of:

     * (a) an Australian citizen; or

     * (b) the holder of a permanent visa that is in effect; or

     * (c) a person who is usually resident in  and whose continued presence in  is not subject to a limitation as to time imposed by law.

         * (B) physical support.

##### 87A  Limit does not prevent the grant of visas to certain people who are unable to meet health or character requirements before the limit applies because of circumstances beyond their control

    * If: 

     * (a) a person has applied, whether before or after the commencement of this section, for the grant of a visa; and

     * (b) a time was or is reached when the grant of the visa to the person in a particular financial year was or is prevented by section 86; and

     * (c) the person was requested by the Minister after that time to satisfy requirements for the grant of the visa that relate to health or character; and

     * (d) after the making of the request referred to in paragraph (c) the person satisfies the requirements referred to in that paragraph in a financial year subsequent to the financial year in which the time referred to in paragraph (b) occurred; and

     * (e) the grant of the visa to the person at the time when the requirements referred to in paragraph (c) are satisfied would, apart from this section, be prevented by section 86; and

     * (f) the person was unable to satisfy the requirements referred to in paragraph (c) at a time when, apart from this section, section 86 would not have prevented the grant of the visa to the person; and

     * (g) the Minister is satisfied that the person's inability to satisfy the requirements referred to in paragraph (c) at a time mentioned in paragraph (e) was due to circumstances beyond the person's control;

    * section 86 does not prevent the grant of the visa to the person.

##### 88  Limit does not affect processing of applications

    * Section 86's prevention of the grant of a visa does not prevent any other action related to the application for it.

##### 89  Determination of limit not to mean failure to decide

    * The fact that the Minister has neither granted nor refused to grant a visa of a class or classes to which a determination under section 85 applies does not mean, for any purpose, that the Minister has failed to make a decision to grant or refuse to grant the visa.

##### 90  Order of dealing with limited visas

    * The fact that an application for a visa of a class or classes to which a determination under section 85 applies has not been considered or disposed of although an application for another visa of the class or classes that was made later has been considered or disposed of does not mean, for any purpose, that the consideration or disposal of the earlier application is unreasonably delayed.

##### 91  Order of dealing with visas

    * If a determination under section 85 applies, or has applied, to visas of a class or classes, the Minister may consider or, subject to section 86, dispose of outstanding and further applications for such visas in such order as he or she considers appropriate.

##### Subdivision AI--Safe third countries

##### 91A  Reason for Subdivision

    * This Subdivision is enacted because the Parliament considers that certain noncitizens who are covered by the CPA, or in relation to whom there is a safe third country, should not be allowed to apply for a protection visa or, in some cases, any other visa. Any such noncitizen who is an unlawful noncitizen will be subject to removal under Division 8.

##### 91B  Interpretation

    * (1) In this Subdivision:

    * **_agreement_** includes a written arrangement or understanding, whether or not binding.

    * **_CPA_** means the Comprehensive Plan of Action approved by the International Conference on IndoChinese Refugees, held at , from 13 to 14 June 1989.

    * (2) For the purposes of this Subdivision, if, apart from this section:

     * (a) a colony, overseas territory or protectorate of a foreign country; or

     * (b) an overseas territory for the international relations of which a foreign country is responsible;

    * is not a country in its own right, the colony, territory or protectorate is taken to be a country in its own right.

##### 91C  Noncitizens covered by Subdivision

    * (1) This Subdivision applies to a noncitizen at a particular time if:

     * (a) the noncitizen is in  at that time; and

     * (b) at that time, the noncitizen is covered by:

      * (i) the CPA; or

      * (ii) an agreement, relating to persons seeking asylum, between  and a country that is, or countries that include a country that is, at that time, a safe third country in relation to the noncitizen (see section 91D); and

     * (c) the noncitizen is not excluded by the regulations from the application of this Subdivision.

    * (2) To avoid doubt, a country does not need to be prescribed as a safe third country at the time that the agreement referred to in subparagraph (1)(b)(ii) is made.

##### 91D  Safe third countries

    * (1) A country is a **_safe third country_** in relation to a noncitizen if:

     * (a) the country is prescribed as a safe third country in relation to the noncitizen, or in relation to a class of persons of which the noncitizen is a member; and

     * (b) the noncitizen has a prescribed connection with the country.

    * (2) Without limiting paragraph (1)(b), the regulations may provide that a person has a prescribed connection with a country if:

     * (a) the person is or was present in the country at a particular time or at any time during a particular period; or

     * (b) the person has a right to enter and reside in the country (however that right arose or is expressed).

    * (3) The Minister must, within 2 sitting days after a regulation under paragraph (1)(a) is laid before a House of the Parliament, cause to be laid before that House a statement, covering the country, or each of the countries, prescribed as a safe third country by the regulation, about:

     * (a) the compliance by the country, or each of the countries, with relevant international law concerning the protection of persons seeking asylum; and

     * (b) the meeting by the country, or each of the countries, of relevant human rights standards for the persons in relation to whom the country is prescribed as a safe third country; and

     * (c) the willingness of the country, or each of the countries, to allow any person in relation to whom the country is prescribed as a safe third country:

      * (i) to go to the country; and

      * (ii) to remain in the country during the period in which any claim by the person for asylum is determined; and

      * (iii) if the person is determined to be a refugee while in the country--to remain in the country until a durable solution relating to the permanent settlement of the person is found.

    * (4) A regulation made for the purposes of paragraph (1)(a) ceases to be in force at the end of 2 years after the regulation commences.

##### 91E  Noncitizens to which this Subdivision applies unable to make valid applications for certain visas

    * Despite any other provision of this Act, if this Subdivision applies to a noncitizen at a particular time and, at that time, the noncitizen applies, or purports to apply, for a protection visa then, subject to section 91F:

     * (a) if the noncitizen has not been immigration cleared at that time--neither that application nor any other application made by the noncitizen for a visa is a valid application; or

     * (b) if the noncitizen has been immigration cleared at that time--neither that application nor any other application made by the noncitizen for a protection visa is a valid application.

##### 91F  Minister may determine that section 91E does not apply to noncitizen

    * (1) If the Minister thinks that it is in the public interest to do so, the Minister may, by written notice given to a particular noncitizen, determine:

     * (a) that section 91E does not apply to an application for a visa made by the noncitizen in the period starting when the notice is given and ending at the end of the seventh working day after the day that the notice is given; or

     * (b) that section 91G does not apply to an application for a visa made by the noncitizen during the transitional period referred to in that section.

    * (2) The power under subsection (1) may only be exercised by the Minister personally.

    * (3) If the Minister makes a determination under subsection (1), he or she is to cause to be laid before each House of the Parliament a statement that:

     * (a) sets out the determination; and

     * (b) sets out the reasons for the determination, referring in particular to the Minister's reasons for thinking that his or her actions are in the public interest.

    * (4) A statement under subsection (3) is not to include:

     * (a) the name of the noncitizen; or

     * (b) any information that may identify the noncitizen; or

     * (c) if the Minister thinks that it would not be in the public interest to publish the name of another person connected in any way with the matter concerned--the name of that other person or any information that may identify that other person.

    * (5) A statement under subsection (3) is to be laid before each House of the Parliament within 15 sitting days of that House after:

     * (a) if the determination is made between 1 January and 30 June (inclusive) in a year--1 July in that year; or

     * (b) if the determination is made between 1 July and 31 December (inclusive) in a year--1 January in the following year.

    * (6) The Minister does not have a duty to consider whether to exercise the power under subsection (1) in respect of any noncitizen, whether he or she is requested to do so by the noncitizen or by any other person, or in any other circumstances.

##### 91G  Applications made before regulations take effect

    * (1) Subject to section 91F and subsection (3), if:

     * (a) this Subdivision applies to a noncitizen immediately after a regulation prescribing a country as a safe third country takes effect and did not apply to the noncitizen immediately before that time; and

     * (b) the regulation prescribes a day as the cut off day; and

     * (c) during the period (the **_transitional period_**) from the beginning of the cut off day until immediately before that regulation takes effect, the noncitizen made an application for a protection visa;

    * then: 

     * (d) if the noncitizen had not been immigration cleared at the time of making the application--that application, and any other application made by the noncitizen for a visa made during the transitional period, ceases to be a valid application when the regulation takes effect; and

     * (e) if the noncitizen had been immigration cleared at the time of making the application--that application, and any other application made by the noncitizen for a protection visa made during the transitional period, ceases to be a valid application when the regulation takes effect; and

     * (f) on and after the regulation takes effect, this Act applies as if the noncitizen had applied for a protection visa immediately after the regulation takes effect.

    * (2) To avoid doubt:

     * (a) paragraphs (1)(d) and (e) apply even if an application referred to in the paragraph concerned, or a decision in relation to such an application, is the subject of a review by, or an appeal or application to, the Migration Review Tribunal, the Refugee Review Tribunal, the Administrative Appeals Tribunal, a Federal Court or any other body or court; and

     * (b) no visa may be granted to the noncitizen as a direct, or indirect, result of such an application.

    * (3) Subsection (1) does not apply in relation to a noncitizen who, before the regulation referred to in that subsection takes effect, has:

     * (b) been determined under this Act to be a noncitizen who satisfies the criterion mentioned in subsection 36(2).

    * (4) The cut off day specified in the regulation must not be:

     * (a) before a day on which the Minister, by notice in the _Gazette_, announces that he or she intends that such a regulation will be made; or

     * (b) more than 6 months before the regulation takes effect.

##### Subdivision AJ--Temporary safe haven visas

##### 91H  Reason for this Subdivision

    * This Subdivision is enacted because the Parliament considers that a noncitizen (other than an unauthorised maritime arrival or a transitory person) who holds a temporary safe haven visa, or who has not left  since ceasing to hold such a visa, should not be allowed to apply for a visa other than another temporary safe haven visa. Any such noncitizen who ceases to hold a visa will be subject to removal under Division 8.

        * Note: For temporary safe haven visas, see section 37A.

##### 91J  Noncitizens to whom this Subdivision applies

    * (1) This Subdivision applies to a noncitizen in  at a particular time if, at that time, the noncitizen:

     * (a) holds a temporary safe haven visa; or

     * (b) has not left  since ceasing to hold a temporary safe haven visa.

    * (2) This Subdivision does not apply to an unauthorised maritime arrival or a transitory person.

        * Note: Unauthorised maritime arrivals are covered by section 46A and transitory persons are covered by section 46B.

##### 91K  Noncitizens to whom this Subdivision applies are unable to make valid applications for certain visas

    * Despite any other provision of this Act but subject to section 91L, if this Subdivision applies to a noncitizen at a particular time and, at that time, the noncitizen applies, or purports to apply, for a visa (other than a temporary safe haven visa), then that application is not a valid application.

##### 91L  Minister may determine that section 91K does not apply to a noncitizen

    * (1) If the Minister thinks that it is in the public interest to do so, the Minister may, by written notice given to a particular noncitizen, determine that section 91K does not apply to an application for a visa made by the noncitizen in the period starting when the notice is given and ending at the end of the seventh working day after the day that the notice is given.

    * (2) The power under subsection (1) may only be exercised by the Minister personally.

    * (3) If the Minister makes a determination under subsection (1), he or she is to cause to be laid before each House of the Parliament a statement that:

     * (a) sets out the determination; and

     * (b) sets out the reasons for the determination, referring in particular to the Minister's reasons for thinking that his or her actions are in the public interest.

    * (4) A statement under subsection (3) is not to include:

     * (a) the name of the noncitizen; or

     * (b) any information that may identify the noncitizen; or

     * (c) if the Minister thinks that it would not be in the public interest to publish the name of another person connected in any way with the matter concerned--the name of that other person or any information that may identify that other person.

    * (5) A statement under subsection (3) is to be laid before each House of the Parliament within 15 sitting days of that House after:

     * (a) if the determination is made between 1 January and 30 June (inclusive) in a year--1 July in that year; or

     * (b) if the determination is made between 1 July and 31 December (inclusive) in a year--1 January in the following year.

    * (6) The Minister does not have a duty to consider whether to exercise the power under subsection (1) in respect of any noncitizen, whether he or she is requested to do so by the noncitizen or by any other person, or in any other circumstances.

##### Subdivision AK--Noncitizens with access to protection from third countries

##### 91M  Reason for this Subdivision

    * This Subdivision is enacted because the Parliament considers that a noncitizen who can avail himself or herself of protection from a third country, because of nationality or some other right to reenter and reside in the third country, should seek protection from the third country instead of applying in Australia for a protection visa, or, in some cases, any other visa. Any such noncitizen who is an unlawful noncitizen will be subject to removal under Division 8.

        * Note: For protection visas, see section 36.

##### 91N  Noncitizens to whom this Subdivision applies

    * (1) This Subdivision applies to a noncitizen at a particular time if, at that time, the noncitizen is a national of 2 or more countries.

    * (2) This Subdivision also applies to a noncitizen at a particular time if, at that time:

     * (a) the noncitizen has a right to reenter and reside in, whether temporarily or permanently and however that right arose or is expressed, any country (the **_available country_**) apart from:

      * (i) ; or

      * (ii) a country of which the noncitizen is a national; or

      * (iii) if the noncitizen has no country of nationality--the country of which the noncitizen is an habitual resident; and

     * (b) the noncitizen has ever resided in the available country for a continuous period of at least 7 days or, if the regulations prescribe a longer continuous period, for at least that longer period; and

     * (c) a declaration by the Minister is in effect under subsection (3) in relation to the available country.

    * (3) The Minister may, after considering any advice received from the Office of the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees:

     * (a) declare in writing that a specified country:

      * (i) provides access, for persons seeking protection, to effective procedures for assessing their need for protection; and

      * (ii) provides protection to persons to whom that country has protection obligations; and

      * (iii) meets relevant human rights standards for persons to whom that country has protection obligations; or

     * (b) in writing, revoke a declaration made under paragraph (a).

    * (4) A declaration made under paragraph (3)(a):

     * (a) takes effect when it is made by the Minister; and

     * (b) ceases to be in effect if and when it is revoked by the Minister under paragraph (3)(b).

    * (5) The Minister must cause a copy of a declaration, or of a revocation of a declaration, to be laid before each House of the Parliament within 2 sitting days of that House after the Minister makes the declaration or revokes the declaration.

    * Determining nationality

    * (6) For the purposes of this section, the question of whether a noncitizen is a national of a particular country must be determined solely by reference to the law of that country.

    * (7) Subsection (6) does not, by implication, affect the interpretation of any other provision of this Act.

##### 91P  Noncitizens to whom this Subdivision applies are unable to make valid applications for certain visas

    * (1) If the Minister thinks that it is in the public interest to do so, the Minister may make a determination (a **_residence determination_**) to the effect that one or more specified persons to whom this Subdivision applies are to reside at a specified place, instead of being detained at a place covered by the definition of **_immigration detention _**in subsection 5(1).

    * (2) A residence determination must:

     * (a) specify the person or persons covered by the determination by name, not by description of a class of persons; and

    * then, at the time when paragraph (b) becomes satisfied, the residence determination, so far as it covers the person, is revoked by force of this subsection and the person is, by that revocation, released from immigration detention.

        * Note: Because the residence determination is revoked, the person is no longer subject to the conditions specified in the determination.

        * Note 2: If the Minister revokes a residence determination (without making a replacement determination) and a person covered by the determination is a person whom section 189 requires to be detained, the person will then have to be taken into detention at a place that is covered by the definition of **_immigration detention _**in subsection 5(1).

    * (2) Any variation of a residence determination must be such that the determination, as varied, will comply with subsections 197AB(1) and (2).

    * Removal on request

    * (1) An officer must remove as soon as reasonably practicable an unlawful noncitizen who asks the Minister, in writing, to be so removed.

      * (i) has not made a valid application for a substantive visa that can be granted when the applicant is in the migration zone; or

    * (3) The fact that an unlawful noncitizen is eligible to apply for a substantive visa that can be granted when the applicant is in the migration zone but has not done so does not prevent the application of subsection (2) or (2A) to him or her.

    * (5) An officer must remove as soon as reasonably practicable an unlawful noncitizen if the noncitizen:

    * (11) This section does not apply to an unauthorised maritime arrival to whom section 198AD applies.

##### Subdivision B--Regional processing

##### 198AA  Reason for Subdivision

    * This Subdivision is enacted because the Parliament considers that: 

     * (a) people smuggling, and its undesirable consequences including the resulting loss of life at sea, are major regional problems that need to be addressed; and

     * (b) unauthorised maritime arrivals, including unauthorised maritime arrivals in respect of whom Australia has or may have protection obligations under the Refugees Convention as amended by the Refugees Protocol, should be able to be taken to any country designated to be a regional processing country; and

     * (c) it is a matter for the Minister and Parliament to decide which countries should be designated as regional processing countries; and

     * (d) the designation of a country to be a regional processing country need not be determined by reference to the international obligations or domestic law of that country.

##### 198AB  Regional processing country

    * (1) The Minister may, by legislative instrument, designate that a country is a **_regional processing country_**.

    * (1A) A legislative instrument under subsection (1):

     * (a) may designate only one country; and

     * (b) must not provide that the designation ceases to have effect.

    * (1B) Despite subsection 12(1) of the _Legislative Instruments Act 2003_, a legislative instrument under subsection (1) of this section commences at the earlier of the following times:

     * (a) immediately after both Houses of the Parliament have passed a resolution approving the designation;

     * (b) immediately after both of the following apply:

      * (i) a copy of the designation has been laid before each House of the Parliament under section 198AC;

      * (ii) 5 sitting days of each House have passed since the copy was laid before that House without it passing a resolution disapproving the designation.

    * (2) The only condition for the exercise of the power under subsection (1) is that the Minister thinks that it is in the national interest to designate the country to be a regional processing country.

    * (3) In considering the national interest for the purposes of subsection (2), the Minister:

     * (a) must have regard to whether or not the country has given Australia any assurances to the effect that:

      * (i) the country will not expel or return a person taken to the country under section 198AD to another country where his or her life or freedom would be threatened on account of his or her race, religion, nationality, membership of a particular social group or political opinion; and

      * (ii) the country will make an assessment, or permit an assessment to be made, of whether or not a person taken to the country under that section is covered by the definition of **_refugee_** in Article 1A of the Refugees Convention as amended by the Refugees Protocol; and

     * (b) may have regard to any other matter which, in the opinion of the Minister, relates to the national interest.

    * (4) The assurances referred to in paragraph (3)(a) need not be legally binding.

    * (5) The power under subsection (1) may only be exercised by the Minister personally.

    * (6) If the Minister designates a country under subsection (1), the Minister may, by legislative instrument, revoke the designation.

    * (7) The rules of natural justice do not apply to the exercise of the power under subsection (1) or (6).

    * (9) In this section, **_country_** includes:

     * (a) a colony, overseas territory or protectorate of a foreign country; and

     * (b) an overseas territory for the international relations of which a foreign country is responsible.

##### 198AC  Documents to be laid before Parliament

    * (1) This section applies if the Minister designates a country to be a regional processing country under subsection 198AB(1).

    * (2) The Minister must cause to be laid before each House of the Parliament:

     * (a) a copy of the designation; and

     * (b) a statement of the Minister's reasons for thinking it is in the national interest to designate the country to be a regional processing country, referring in particular to any assurances of a kind referred to in paragraph 198AB(3)(a) that have been given by the country; and

     * (c) a copy of any written agreement between Australia and the country relating to the taking of persons to the country; and

     * (d) a statement about the Minister's consultations with the Office of the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees in relation to the designation, including the nature of those consultations; and

     * (e) a summary of any advice received from that Office in relation to the designation; and

     * (f) a statement about any arrangements that are in place, or are to be put in place, in the country for the treatment of persons taken to the country.

    * (3) The Minister must comply with subsection (2) within 2 sitting days of each House of the Parliament after the day on which the designation is made.

    * (4) The sole purpose of laying the documents referred to in subsection (2) before the Parliament is to inform the Parliament of the matters referred to in the documents and nothing in the documents affects the validity of the designation. Similarly, the fact that some or all of those documents do not exist does not affect the validity of the designation.

    * (5) A failure to comply with this section does not affect the validity of the designation.

    * (6) In this section, **_agreement_** includes an agreement, arrangement or understanding:

     * (a) whether or not it is legally binding; and

     * (b) whether it is made before, on or after the commencement of this section.
