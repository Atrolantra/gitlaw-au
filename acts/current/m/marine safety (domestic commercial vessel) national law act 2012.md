     * (3) If, to ensure the validity of the purported imposition of the duty, it is necessary that the duty be imposed by a law of the Commonwealth (rather than by force of the law of a State or Territory), the duty is taken to be imposed by this Act to the extent necessary to ensure that validity.

      * (b) does not apply for those purposes if the corresponding StateTerritory law otherwise provides.

     * (2) If the corresponding StateTerritory law purports to impose a duty on the National Regulator or other officer or authority of the Commonwealth to do a particular thing, the duty is taken to be imposed by the corresponding StateTerritory law to the extent to which imposing the duty:

      * (b) the power to operate electronic equipment on the vessel to transfer the data to a disk, tape or other storage device that:

       * (i) is brought onto the vessel for the exercise of the power; or

       * (ii) is on the vessel and the use of which for that purpose has been agreed in writing by the occupier of the vessel;

      * and remove the disk, tape or other storage device from the vessel.
