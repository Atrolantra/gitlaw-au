##### 2  Commencement

  * This Act commences, or is taken to have commenced, on 1 July 2004.

##### 3  Definitions

  * **_contribution year_** has the meaning given by section 5.

  * **_medical indemnity insurer_** has the same meaning as in the _Medical Indemnity Act 2002_.

  * **_premium income_**, for a contribution year, has the meaning given by section 7.

  * **_run-off cover support payment_** means a payment that is payable under Division 2 of Part 3 of the _Medical Indemnity Act 2002_.

##### 4  Imposition of run-off cover support payment

  * For each contribution year, a run-off cover support payment is imposed as a tax on each medical indemnity insurer.

##### 5  Contribution year

  * (1) Subject to subsection (2), each:

   * (a) financial year; or

   * (b) other period of 12 months specified in the regulations;

  * that starts on or after 1 July 2004 is a contribution year.

  * (2) The regulations may declare that a financial year specified in the regulations is the last contribution year. If they do so, no subsequent financial year, or period of 12 months specified in the regulations for the purposes of paragraph (1)(b), is a contribution year.

  * (3) Regulations made for the purposes of paragraph (1)(b) may specify a different period for a particular medical indemnity insurer or class of medical indemnity insurers. If they do so, the reference in subsection (1) to the period is taken, in its application to that insurer or to an insurer of that class, to be a reference to that period for that insurer or class.

##### 6  Amount of run-off cover support payment

  * (1) The amount of the run-off cover support payment imposed on a medical indemnity insurer for a contribution year is the applicable percentage of the insurer's premium income for:

   * (a) the period of 12 months ending on 31 May in the contribution year; or

   * (b) such other period as is specified in the regulations.

  * (2) The applicable percentage is:

   * (a) 15%; or

   * (b) such lower percentage as is specified in the regulations for the contribution year.

  * (3) Regulations made for the purposes of paragraph (1)(b) may specify a different period for a particular medical indemnity insurer or class of medical indemnity insurers. If they do so, the reference in subsection (1) to the period is taken, in its application to that insurer or to an insurer of that class, to be a reference to that period for that insurer or class.

  * (4) Regulations made for the purposes of paragraph (2)(b) may specify a different applicable percentage for a particular medical indemnity insurer or class of medical indemnity insurers. If they do so, the reference in subsection (1) to the applicable percentage is taken, in its application to that insurer or to an insurer of that class, to be a reference to that percentage for that insurer or class.

##### 7  Premium income

  * (1) A medical indemnity insurer's **_premium income_** for a period is the sum of all of the premiums paid during the period to the insurer for medical indemnity cover provided for medical practitioners by contracts of insurance with the insurer, and includes:

   * (a) the sum of all amounts that:

    * (i) were paid to the insurer during the period under one or more schemes formulated under subsection 43(1) of the _Medical Indemnity Act 2002_; and

    * (ii) were payments of a kind referred to in paragraph 43(1)(a) of that Act; and

   * (b) the sum of all amounts paid to the insurer during the period that are amounts of a kind specified in the regulations for the purposes of this subsection.

  * (2) However, the amount of a medical indemnity insurer's premium income for a period under subsection (1) is reduced by:

   * (a) any amount of GST payable during the period for any supply made by the insurer for which premiums and other amounts referred to in subsection (1) are consideration; and

   * (b) the sum of all amounts of stamp duty payable during the period, under a law of a State or Territory, in connection with medical indemnity cover, or contracts of insurance, referred to in subsection (1); and

   * (c) the sum of all amounts payable during the period that are amounts of a kind specified in the regulations for the purposes of this subsection; and

   * (d) the amount worked out under subsection (2A).

  * (2A) The amount referred to in paragraph (2)(d) is worked out as follows:



  * where: 

  * **_applicable rate_** is the applicable percentage under subsection 6(2) for the insurer, expressed as a decimal fraction.

  * **_net premium_** is the sum of all the premiums referred to in subsection (1) reduced by the amounts referred to in paragraphs (2)(a), (b) and (c) in relation to those premiums.

  * (3) In this section:

  * **_consideration_** has the same meaning as in the _A New Tax System (Goods and Services Tax) Act 1999_.

  * **_GST_** has the same meaning as in the _A New Tax System (Goods and Services Tax) Act 1999_.

  * **_medical indemnity cover_** has the same meaning as in the _Medical Indemnity Act 2002_.

  * **_medical practitioner_** has the same meaning as it has for the purposes of Division 2B of Part 2 of the _Medical Indemnity Act 2002_.

    * Note: See subsections 4(1) and (6) of the _Medical Indemnity Act 2002_.
