## Chapter 2--Accepting liability for service injuries, diseases and deaths

### Part 1--Simplified outline of this Chapter

##### 21  Simplified outline of this Chapter

    * A condition for most benefits under this Act is that the Commission has accepted liability for an injury, disease or death. The Commission accepts liability if there is some connection between the injury, disease or death and defence service.

    * The process for deciding whether to accept liability is as follows: 

        * (a) first, a person makes a claim under section 319 for acceptance of liability for an injury, disease or death (the rules for making claims are found in Chapter 7);

        * (b) then, the Commission decides whether the injury, disease or death is a service injury, disease or death under Part 3;

        * (c) then, the Commission decides whether it is prevented from accepting liability for the injury, disease or death because of an exclusion under Part 4 (for example, because the injury, disease or death resulted from a serious default or a wilful act).

    * The Commission must accept liability if the injury, disease or death is a service injury, disease or death, and none of the exclusions in Part 4 apply.

    * The effect of this Chapter in respect of cadets and declared members might be modified by the regulations (see section 439).

### Part 2--When the Commission must accept liability for service injuries, diseases and deaths

##### 22  Simplified outline of this Part

    * The Commission accepts liability for an injury, disease or death under this Part.

    * The Commission must accept liability if a claim for acceptance of liability has been made under section 319, the injury, disease or death is a service injury, disease or death, and none of the exclusions in Part 4 apply.

    * There are 2 standards of proof that the Commission applies in deciding matters under this Chapter (and the rest of the Act).

    * The more beneficial standard of proof (in subsections 335(1) and (2)) applies to some claims that an injury, disease or death is a service injury, disease or death that relates to warlike or nonwarlike service. The other standard of proof (in subsection 335(3)) applies to all other decisions under this Chapter.

    * For some claims for acceptance of liability for an injury, disease or death the standard of proof can only be met if the injury or disease, or the cause of death, is covered by a Statement of Principles (see sections 338 and 339). (Chapter 7 has more rules about the Statements of Principles.)

    * A Statement of Principles is an instrument made under the _Veterans' Entitlements Act 1986_. The Statement sets out all factors related to defence service that have been found to cause specific injuries, diseases and deaths.

    * For other claims for acceptance of liability, the Statements of Principles are not relevant.

##### 23  Commission's acceptance of liability for service injuries and diseases

    * When Commission must accept liability for service injuries and diseases

    * (1) The Commission must accept liability for an injury sustained, or a disease contracted, by a person if:

        * Note 2: The standard of proof mentioned in subsection 335(3) applies to the following:

         * (a) claims that the injury or disease is a service injury or disease that relates to peacetime service;

         * (b) all claims when determining whether a person sustained a particular injury or contracted a particular disease;

     * (b) a claim for acceptance of liability for the injury or disease has been made under section 319.

        * Note: The standard of proof mentioned in subsection 335(3) applies to all claims:

         * (a) that an injury or disease is a service injury or disease under section 29; and

         * (b) when determining whether a person sustained a particular injury or contracted a particular disease.

    * (3) The Commission must accept liability for an injury sustained, or a disease contracted, by a person if:

     * (a) the person's injury or disease is a service injury or disease under section 30 (aggravations etc. of signs and symptoms); and

     * (b) the Commission is not prevented from accepting liability for the injury or disease by Part 4; and

     * (c) a claim for acceptance of liability for the injury or disease has been made under section 319.

        * Note 1: The standard of proof mentioned in subsections 335(1) and (2) applies to claims that the injury or disease is a service injury or disease that relates to warlike or nonwarlike service.

        * Note 2: The standard of proof mentioned in subsection 335(3) applies to the following:

         * (a) claims that an injury or disease is a service injury or disease that relates to peacetime service; and

         * (b) all claims when determining whether a sign or symptom was aggravated etc.; and

         * (c) all claims when determining whether the Commission is prevented from accepting liability for the injury or disease by Part 4.

    * Acceptance of liability for aggravations etc. of injuries and diseases

    * (4) A reference in this section to acceptance of liability for an injury or disease is taken to include a reference to acceptance of liability for an aggravation of an injury or disease.

        * Note: The definitions of **_injury _**and **_disease _**exclude aggravations (see section 5).

##### 24  Commission's acceptance of liability for service deaths

    * When Commission must accept liability for service deaths

    * (1) The Commission must accept liability for the death of a person if:

     * (a) the person's death is a service death under section 28; and

     * (b) the Commission is not prevented from accepting liability for the death by subsection 34(4) or section 35 or 36; and

     * (c) a claim for acceptance of liability for the death has been made under section 319.

        * Note 1: The standard of proof mentioned in subsections 335(1) and (2) applies to claims that the death is a service death that relates to warlike or nonwarlike service.

        * Note 2: The standard of proof mentioned in subsection 335(3) applies to the following:

         * (a) claims that the death is a service death that relates to peacetime service;

         * (b) all claims when determining whether a person sustained or contracted a particular injury or disease;

         * (c) all claims when determining the cause of a person's death;

         * (d) all claims when determining whether the Commission is prevented from accepting liability for the death by subsection 34(4) or section 35 or 36.

    * When Commission must accept liability for service deaths arising from Commonwealth treatment

    * (2) The Commission must accept liability for the death of a person if:

     * (a) the person's death is a service death under section 29 (service death arising from treatment provided by the Commonwealth); and

     * (b) a claim for acceptance of liability for the death has been made under section 319.

        * Note: The standard of proof mentioned in subsection 335(3) applies to all claims:

         * (a) that a death is a service death under section 29; and

         * (b) when determining the cause of a person's death.

    * Commission must accept liability for deaths after being prevented from accepting liability for the injury or disease that resulted in the death

    * (3) To avoid doubt, the Commission must accept liability for a service death even if the Commission was prevented by section 32 or 33 from accepting liability for a service injury or disease that resulted in the death.

        * Note: Sections 32 and 33 only prevent the Commission from accepting liability for a service injury or disease, and not a service death.

##### 25  Limited effect of acceptance of liability

    * The Commission's acceptance of liability for an injury, disease or death only has effect for the purposes of this Act.

        * Note: This means that a person cannot rely on the Commission's acceptance of liability for an injury, disease or death in a common law action against the Commonwealth.

### Part 3--Definitions of service injury, service disease and service death

##### 26  Simplified outline of this Part

    * This Part defines **_service injury_**, **_service disease _**and **_service death_**.

    * An injury, disease or death is a service injury, disease or death if:

        * (a) it is related to defence service in the ways mentioned in section 27 or 28; or

        * (b) it resulted from certain treatment provided by the Commonwealth (see section 29); or

        * (c) an aggravation of, or a material contribution to, a sign or symptom of the injury or disease relates to defence service (see section 30).

    * However, even if an injury, disease or death is a service injury or disease under this Part, the Commission might be prevented from accepting liability for the injury, disease or death by an exclusion under Part 4.

##### 27  Main definitions of service injury and service disease

    * For the purposes of this Act, an injury sustained, or a disease contracted, by a person is a **_service injury _**or a **_service disease _**if one or more of the following apply:

     * (a) the injury or disease resulted from an occurrence that happened while the person was a member rendering defence service;

     * (b) the injury or disease arose out of, or was attributable to, any defence service rendered by the person while a member;

     * (c) in the opinion of the Commission:

      * (i) the injury was sustained due to an accident that would not have occurred; or

      * (ii) the disease would not have been contracted;

     * but for: 

      * (iii) the person having rendered defence service while a member; or

      * (iv) changes in the person's environment consequent upon his or her having rendered defence service while a member;

     * (d) the injury or disease:

      * (i) was sustained or contracted while the person was a member rendering defence service, but did not arise out of that service; or

      * (ii) was sustained or contracted before the commencement of a period of defence service rendered by the person while a member, but not while the person was rendering defence service;

     * and, in the opinion of the Commission, the injury or disease was contributed to in a material degree by, or was aggravated by, any defence service rendered by the person while a member after he or she sustained the injury or contracted the disease;

         * Note: This paragraph might not cover aggravations of, or material contributions to, signs and symptoms of an injury or disease (see _Repatriation Commission v Yates_ (1995) 38 Administrative Law Decisions 80). This is dealt with in section 30.

     * (e) the injury or disease resulted from an accident that occurred while the person was travelling, while a member rendering peacetime service but otherwise than in the course of duty, on a journey:

      * (i) to a place for the purpose of performing duty; or

      * (ii) away from a place of duty upon having ceased to perform duty.

##### 28  Main definition of service death

    * Definition of **service death**

    * **	(1)	For the purposes of this Act, the death of a person is a **_service death _**if one or more of the following apply:

     * (a) the death resulted from an occurrence that happened while the person was a member rendering defence service;

     * (b) the death arose out of, or was attributable to, any defence service rendered by the person while a member;

     * (c) in the opinion of the Commission, the death was due to:

      * (i) an accident that would not have occurred; or

      * (ii) a disease that would not have been contracted;

     * but for: 

      * (iii) the person having rendered defence service while a member; or

      * (iv) changes in the person's environment consequent upon his or her having rendered defence service while a member;

     * (d) the injury or disease from which the person died:

      * (i) was sustained or contracted while the person was a member rendering defence service, but did not arise out of that service; or

      * (ii) was sustained or contracted before the commencement of a period of defence service rendered by the person while a member, but not while the person was rendering defence service;

     * and, in the opinion of the Commission, the injury or disease was contributed to in a material degree by, or was aggravated by, any defence service rendered by the person while a member after he or she sustained the injury or contracted the disease;

     * (e) the injury or disease from which the person died is an injury or disease that has been determined under section 27, 29 or 30 to be a service injury or a service disease, as the case may be;

         * Note 1: The effect of this paragraph is that, if the person has died from an injury or disease that has already been determined by the Commission to be a service injury or disease, the death is a service death. Accordingly, the Commission is not required to relate the death to defence service rendered by the person and sections 338 and 339 do not apply.

         * Note 2: This paragraph does not apply to certain aggravations etc. of injuries and diseases (see subsection (2)).

     * (f) the death resulted from an accident that occurred while the person was travelling, while a member rendering peacetime service but otherwise than in the course of duty, on a journey:

      * (i) to a place for the purpose of performing duty; or

      * (ii) away from a place of duty upon having ceased to perform duty.

    * Aggravations etc. that cease before death

    * (2) Paragraph (1)(e) does not apply if:

     * (a) the service injury or disease mentioned in that paragraph is an aggravated injury or disease; and

     * (b) immediately before the death, the injury or disease was no longer aggravated or contributed to in a material degree.

##### 29  Definitions of service injury, service disease and service death arising from treatment provided by the Commonwealth

    * Liability for injuries and diseases caused by treatment

    * Liability for injuries and diseases aggravated by treatment

    * (2) For the purposes of this Act, an injury (the **_relevant injury_**) sustained, or a disease (the **_relevant disease_**) contracted, by a person is a **_service injury_** or a **_service disease_** if:

      * (i) the person receives treatment for an earlier service injury or service disease;

      * (ii) the treatment is paid for or provided wholly or partly by the Commonwealth;

      * (iii) as a consequence of that treatment, the relevant injury or relevant disease, or a sign or symptom of the relevant injury or relevant disease, is aggravated by the treatment; or

     * (b) the person receives any treatment under regulations made under the _Defence Act 1903_ for an earlier injury or disease that is not a service injury or service disease and, as an unintended consequence of that treatment, the relevant injury or relevant disease, or a sign or symptom of the relevant injury or relevant disease, is aggravated by the treatment.

    * Liability for deaths caused by treatment

    * (3) For the purposes of this Act, the death of a person is a **_service death_** if:

     * (a) either:

      * (ii) the person receives any treatment under regulations made under the _Defence Act 1903_; and

     * (b) as a consequence of that treatment, the person dies.

##### 30  Definitions of service injury and service disease for aggravations etc. of signs and symptoms

    * For the purposes of this Act, an injury sustained, or a disease contracted, by a person is a **_service injury _**or a **_service disease _**if:

     * (a) the injury or disease:

      * (i) was sustained or contracted while the person was a member rendering defence service, but did not arise out of that service; or

### Part 4--When the Commission is prevented from accepting liability for service injuries, diseases and deaths

##### 31  Simplified outline of this Part

    * Even if the Commission decides that an injury, disease or death is a service injury, disease or death, the Commission might be prevented from accepting liability for that injury, disease or death because of an exclusion under this Part.

    * There are 5 kinds of exclusions. They relate to the following:

        * (a) serious defaults or wilful acts etc.;

        * (c) false representations;

        * (d) travel during peacetime service;

    * (2) If the Commission does so, a reference in sections 112, 113 and 114 to a time before the Reservist began his or her last period of continuous fulltime service is taken instead to be a reference to a time before the onset date for the Reservist's incapacity.

##### Subdivision E--Working out actual earnings

##### 115  Working out actual earnings

    * (1) The **_actual earnings _**for a week for an incapacitated Reservist means the amount worked out using the following formula:

##### 116B  Amount of compensation for person receiving only Commonwealth superannuation pension

    * (1) If paragraph 89A(a) applies to a person, the amount of compensation that the Commonwealth is liable, under section 85, 86 or 87, to pay to the person for a week is worked out using the following formula:

    * (2) In this Division:

    * **_Division 1 compensation amount_** for a person for a week means the amount of compensation the person would have been paid for the week if subsection 89(1) had applied.

    * **_superannuation pension amount _**for a person who receives a pension for a week under a Commonwealth superannuation scheme means:

     * (a) if the scheme identifies a part of the pension as attributable to the contributions made under or to the scheme by the Commonwealth or a Commonwealth authority--the amount of that part; or

     * (b) in any other case, either:

    * **_superannuation lump sum amount _**for a person who receives a lump sum under a Commonwealth superannuation scheme means:

     * (a) if the scheme identifies a part of the lump sum as attributable to the contributions made under or to the scheme by the Commonwealth or a Commonwealth authority--the amount of that part; or

     * (b) in any other case, either:

      * (i) the amount assessed by the Commission to be the part of the lump sum that is attributable to the contributions made under or to the scheme by the Commonwealth or a Commonwealth authority; or

    * If paragraph 89A(c) applies to a person, the amount of compensation that the Commonwealth is liable, under section 85, 86 or 87, to pay to the person for a week is worked out using the following formula:

        * Note: Subsection 116B(2) defines **_Division 1 compensation amount _**and **_superannuation pension amount_**. Subsection 116C(2) defines **_superannuation agebased number_** and **_superannuation lump sum amount_**.

##### 116E  No compensation if amount worked out is nil or a negative amount

    * If an amount of compensation worked out under this Division is nil or a negative amount, then the Commonwealth is not liable to pay the compensation for the week.

### Part 4--Compensation for incapacity for work for former members

#### Division 1--Entitlement to compensation

##### 117  Simplified outline of this Part

    * This Part provides for compensation to be provided for former members who are incapacitated for work as a result of a service injury or disease. The Commission must have accepted liability for the injury or disease, and a claim must have been made in respect of the former member, to be entitled to the compensation.

    * The amount of compensation a person receives for a week depends on the difference between the person's normal and actual earnings for the week. The person's normal earnings are a notional amount. The person's actual earnings are based on how much the person actually earns for the week.

    * Normal earnings are worked out under Divisions 3 to 8.

    * Division 3 applies to a person who left the Defence Force as a Permanent Forces member. Division 4 applies to a person who left the Defence Force as a continuous fulltime Reservist.

    * Divisions 5 to 8 apply to a person who left the Defence Force as a parttime Reservist. The Division that applies depends on the person's status (for example, as a Permanent Forces member or a Reservist) when the service injury or disease occurred and on leaving the Defence Force.

    * Division 9 applies to a person who was a cadet or declared member.

    * Part 5 of this Chapter contains other important rules that apply in working out normal earnings, actual earnings and the amount of compensation generally.

        * Note: The Commonwealth is not liable to pay compensation if the amount worked out under Division 2 is nil or a negative amount.

##### 119  No compensation in certain cases relating to aggravations etc. of injuries or diseases

    * The Commonwealth is only liable, under section 118, to pay compensation in respect of an aggravated injury or disease if it is because of the aggravation or material contribution (whether wholly or partly) that the service injury or disease results in the person's incapacity for work for the week.

    * (1) This section applies to a person (the **_patient_**) if:

     * (a) the patient has been continuously maintained in a hospital or other institution as a result of a service injury or disease for at least one year; and

     * (c) the patient has:

      * (i) no dependants; and

      * (ii) no dependent young persons (see subsection (4)); and

      * (iii) no carer for a dependent young person (see subsection (4)); and

     * (d) subsection 125(1) would apply to the patient but for the operation of this section.

    * Amount of compensation

    * (2) The Commission must determine the amount of compensation that it considers reasonable that the Commonwealth is liable, under section 118, to pay to the patient for each week during which he or she is so maintained. However, the amount must be at least onehalf of, and not more than, the amount of compensation that would otherwise have been payable to the patient for a week if subsection 125(1) had applied.

    * Matters to be considered

##### 128  Simplified outline of this Subdivision

    * This Subdivision tells you the normal rule for working out the amount of compensation for a former member.

    * The person is paid a full amount of compensation for at least the first 45 weeks of the incapacity. A reduced rate of compensation might be paid after that depending on how many hours a week the person is working.

##### 129  Amount of compensation for maximum rate weeks

    * (1) If subsection 125(1) applies to a person, the amount of compensation that the Commonwealth is liable, under section 118, to pay to the person for a week that is a maximum rate week is worked out using the following formula:

        * Note: Section 132 defines **_normal earnings_** and **_actual earnings_**.

    * (2) In this Subdivision, a week is a **_maximum rate week_** for a person who is incapacitated for work if:

     * (a) it is a week during which:

      * (i) the person's incapacity prevents the person from working his or her normal weekly hours; or

      * (ii) if the person is working his or her normal weekly hours, the person's incapacity prevents the person from working at the level at which he or she worked before the incapacity; and

     * (b) the total number of hours in that week, and in all previous maximum rate weeks (if any), during which the incapacity has prevented the person from so working, does not exceed 45 times the person's normal weekly hours.

        * Note: Section 132 defines **_normal weekly hours_**.

##### 130  Amount of compensation for the week whose hours exceed 45 times the normal weekly hours

    * (1) If during, but before the end of, a particular week the total number of hours worked out in accordance with paragraph 129(2)(b) exceeds 45 times the normal weekly hours for a person, then:

     * (a) subsection (2) applies in respect of the hours that elapse before that number is exceeded (the maximum rate hours as defined in subsection (2)); and

     * (b) subsection (3) applies in respect of the remaining hours in the week (the reduced rate hours as defined in subsection (3)).

        * Note: Section 132 defines **_normal weekly hours_**.

    * Amount of compensation in respect of maximum rate hours

    * (2) The amount of compensation that the Commonwealth is liable, under section 118, to pay to a person in respect of the maximum rate hours is worked out using the following formula:

    * where: 

    * **_maximum rate hours_** for a person means the total number of hours in the week:

     * (a) that would have counted towards the person's normal weekly hours (whether those hours are worked or not); and

     * (b) that elapse before the total number of hours worked out in accordance with paragraph 129(2)(b) exceeds 45 times the person's normal weekly hours.

        * Note: Section 132 defines **_normal weekly hours_**, **_normal earnings_** and **_actual earnings_**.

    * Amount of compensation in respect of reduced rate hours

    * (3) The amount of compensation that the Commonwealth is liable, under section 118, to pay to a person in respect of the reduced rate hours is worked out using the following formula:

    * **_reduced rate hours_** for a person means the total number of hours worked out using the following formula:

        * Note: Section 132 defines **_normal weekly hours_**. Subsection (2) defines **_maximum rate hours_**.

##### 131  Amount of compensation after 45 weeks

    * (1) If subsection 125(1) applies to a person, the amount of compensation that the Commonwealth is liable, under section 118, to pay to the person for a week (other than a week in respect of which section 129 or 130 applies) is worked out using the following formula:

    * (2) In this section:

    * **_adjustment percentage_** for a person for a week means the following percentage:

     * (a) if the person is not working during that week--75%;

     * (b) if the person is working for 25% or less of his or her normal weekly hours during that week--80%;

     * (c) if the person is working for more than 25% but not more than 50% of his or her normal weekly hours during that week--85%;

     * (d) if the person is working for more than 50% but not more than 75% of his or her normal weekly hours during that week--90%;

        * Note 1: Bonuses are excluded from the calculation of actual earnings under section 180.

        * Note 2: Section 181 sets out some matters that the Commission must have regard to in determining the amount that the person is able to earn under paragraph (a).

    * (2) Use this table to work out the **_normal earnings_** and the **_normal weekly hours_** for a person:

        * Note 1: If a person's normal earnings are less than the relevant minimum wage set by a national minimum wage order, then the person's normal earnings are instead the relevant minimum wage (see section 179).

        * Note 2: Certain amounts (such as bonuses) are excluded from the calculation of normal earnings under section 180.

##### Subdivision D--Amount of compensation where Commonwealth superannuation is received

##### 133  Simplified outline of this Subdivision

    * This Subdivision tells you how to work out the amount of compensation a person receives for a week if the person receives or has received Commonwealth superannuation.

      * (i) the amount assessed by the Commission to be the part of the pension that is attributable to the contribution made under or to the scheme by the Commonwealth or a Commonwealth authority; or

      * (ii) if such an assessment cannot be made--the amount of the pension received by the person for the week.

##### 135  Amount of compensation for retired person who has received only Commonwealth superannuation lump sum

    * (1) If paragraph 126(d) applies to a person, the amount of compensation that the Commonwealth is liable, under section 118, to pay to the person for a week is worked out using the following formula:

##### Subdivision E--Small amounts of compensation

##### 137  Simplified outline of this Subdivision

    * Under this Subdivision, a person who receives weekly compensation of $150 or less is entitled to convert that amount into a lump sum if the person is still working or is receiving or has received Commonwealth superannuation.

    * If the person later stops working because the person's condition deteriorates, or the person stops receiving the superannuation, then the person can be paid compensation on a weekly basis again.

##### 138  Converting small amounts of weekly compensation into lump sum compensation

    * (1) This section applies if:

     * (a) apart from this section, the Commonwealth would be liable to pay an amount of compensation, worked out in accordance with subsection 125(1) or section 126, of $150 or less for a person's incapacity for work for a week; and

        * Note 2: The amount of $150 is indexed under section 404.

    * (2) Instead of being liable to pay compensation for that week and future weeks, the amount of compensation that the Commonwealth is liable to pay is the amount of the lump sum worked out using the following formula:

     * (a) the Commonwealth has paid a lump sum to a person under section 138 in respect of the person's incapacity for work; and

     * (b) either:

      * (i) subparagraph 138(1)(b)(i) applied and the person's condition later deteriorates to the extent that the person is no longer able to engage in work; or

      * (ii) subparagraph 138(1)(b)(ii) applied and the person stops receiving the pension under the Commonwealth superannuation scheme; and

     * (c) the Commission is satisfied that the person's incapacity is likely to continue indefinitely.

    * (2) The Commonwealth is liable to pay compensation under section 118 for each week during which the person continues to be incapacitated for work.

    * This Division tells you how to work out the normal earnings for a person: 

        * (a) who was a Permanent Forces member or a continuous fulltime Reservist when the service injury or disease occurred; and

        * (b) who was a parttime Reservist when he or she left the Defence Force; and

Alternatively, normal earnings can be based on the person's earnings from other work engaged in before beginning his or her last period of continuous fulltime service. (This amount is called the preCFTS earnings.)

    * Normal earnings worked out under this Division might be adjusted under Part 5.

    * Subdivision D tells you how to work out the normal weekly hours for a person who chooses the preCFTS earnings. (Normal weekly hours for a person who chooses the ADF earnings are 37.5 hours (see subsection 132(2).)

##### Subdivision B--Working out normal earnings for former parttime Reservists who were previously continuous fulltime Reservists

     * (b) that the person would have been paid after completing his or her initial training, as mentioned in section 189.

##### Subdivision D--Working out preCFTS earnings

##### 169  Simplified outline of this Subdivision

    * The preCFTS earnings are worked out by looking back at the period before the person began his or her last period of continuous fulltime service. During this period, the person might have been a parttime Reservist as well as being engaged in work.

    * The person's preCFTS earnings have 2 components: preCFTS pay and reserve pay.

    * The person's preCFTS pay is based on earnings from work the person was engaged in before beginning the last period of continuous fulltime service. The work engaged in might be civilian work or defence work (as some people become continuous fulltime Reservists after being Permanent Forces members).

    * The person's reserve pay is based on earnings from service as a parttime Reservist.

    * However, for a person whose service injury or disease occurred while a continuous fulltime Reservist, the Commission may determine preCFTS earnings by looking back at the period before the person last ceased to be a member of the Defence Force instead of the period before the person began his or her last period of continuous fulltime service.

    * (2) The amount of pay that the person would have earned, and the amount of payrelated allowances that the person would have been paid, for each such week is the amount advised under subsection (3).

        * Note: An amount advised under this section might later include increases mentioned in section 185.

    * (3) The Chief of the Defence Force must advise the Commission in writing of the following:

     * (a) the rank that the Chief of the Defence Force considers the person would have held after completing the initial training;

     * (b) the amount of pay for a week for that rank that the Chief of the Defence Force considers the person would have earned as a member of the Defence Force after completing the training;

     * (c) any payrelated allowance that the Chief of the Defence Force considers the person would have been paid after completing the training;

     * (d) the amount of that payrelated allowance for a week that the Chief of the Defence Force considers the person would have been paid after completing the training.

##### 190  No other adjustments to be taken into account

    * The only adjustments of the amount of a person's pay or a payrelated allowance to be taken into account in determining the person's normal earnings are the adjustments mentioned in this Division.

#### Division 4--Adjusting other pay

##### 191  Simplified outline of this Division

    * This Division adjusts the amount of a person's civilian daily earnings or preCFTS pay if:

        * (a) the amount is varied during the example period; or

        * (b) it is impracticable to work it out for the person.

##### 192  Definitions of civilian daily earnings, example period and preCFTS pay

    * **_preCFTS pay_** has the meaning given by section 112, 147 or 171 (as the case requires).

##### 193  Variations during the example period

    * (1) This section applies for the purposes of sections 98, 112, 147, 156 and 171 if a person's civilian daily earnings or preCFTS pay varies during the example period.

    * (2) If the variation occurs as a result of:

     * (a) the operation of a law of the Commonwealth, a State or a Territory; or

     * (b) the making, alteration or operation of a national minimum wage order (within the meaning given by the _Fair Work Act 2009_), or an award, order, determination or industrial agreement, or the doing of any other act or thing, under such a law;

    * then the amount of the civilian daily earnings or preCFTS pay for the person is instead the amount that would have been his or her civilian daily earnings or preCFTS pay if the variation had taken effect at the beginning of the example period.

##### 194  Civilian daily earnings or preCFTS pay if working them out is impracticable

    * (1) This section applies for the purposes of sections 98, 112, 147, 156 and 171 if it is impracticable to work out the civilian daily earnings or preCFTS pay for a person.

#### Division 5--Working out compensation for parts of weeks

##### 195  Simplified outline of this Division

    * This Division sets out how to work out the amount of compensation the Commonwealth is liable to pay under Part 3 or 4 of this Chapter if a person is only entitled to compensation for part of a week and not a whole week.

##### 196  Working out compensation for parts of weeks

    * (1) The Commonwealth is liable to pay compensation under section 85, 86, 87 or 118 for a part of a week rather than a whole week if a person satisfies subsection 85(1), 86(1), 87(1) or 118(1) for the part of the week.

    * (2) The following formula sets out how to work out the amount of compensation that the Commonwealth is liable to pay to a person for a part of a week rather than a whole week:

    * (3) In this section:

    * **_number of days_** means:

     * (a) if the person is entitled to compensation under section 118 and Division 6 of Part 4 applies to the person--7; and

     * (b) if the person is entitled to compensation under section 87--the number of days prescribed by the regulations in respect of the person; and

     * (c) otherwise:

      * (i) 5; or

      * (ii) if the Commission determines another number as the number of days that the person would normally work in the part of the week--that other number.

        * Note 2: Section 87 applies to incapacitated cadets and declared members.

### Part 6--Choice to receive a Special Rate Disability Pension

##### 197  Simplified outline of this Part

    * This Part provides a choice for severely impaired people (at least 50 impairment points) who are unable to work more than 10 hours per week to receive a pension under this Part instead of compensation worked out under Division 2 of Part 4.

    * The rate of the pension is the same as the rate applicable under section 24 of the _Veterans' Entitlements Act 1986_. However, the rate may be reduced for a recipient who receives an amount under Part 2 (permanent impairment) or who receives Commonwealth superannuation.

    * A person who works more than 10 hours per week stops receiving the Special Rate Disability Pension. However, the person might still be eligible for assistance under the Return to Work Scheme determined by the Commission under section 210, or compensation worked out under Division 2 of Part 4.

##### 198  What is a Special Rate Disability Pension?

    * (1) A **_Special Rate Disability Pension_** is an ongoing weekly payment (other than a payment under the Return to Work Scheme in section 210) that can be paid to certain persons instead of compensation worked out under Division 2 of Part 4.

    * (2) The maximum weekly amount of a Special Rate Disability Pension is one half of the fortnightly rate at which a pension is payable from time to time under section 24 of the _Veterans' Entitlements Act 1986_.

##### 199  Persons who are eligible to make a choice under this Part

    * (1) A person is eligible to make a choice under this Part if the Commission is satisfied that the person meets the following criteria (the **_eligibility criteria_**):

     * (a) at least one of the following applies:

      * (i) the person is receiving compensation worked out under Division 2 of Part 4 as a result of one or more service injuries or diseases;

      * (ii) the amount, under section 126, of the person's compensation for a week, as a result of one or more service injuries or diseases, is nil or a negative amount;

      * (iii) the person has been paid a lump sum under section 138 in respect of the person's incapacity for work as a result of one or more service injuries or diseases;

     * (b) as a result of the injuries or diseases, the person has suffered an impairment that is likely to continue indefinitely;

     * (c) the Commission has determined under Part 2 that the person's impairment constitutes at least 50 impairment points;

     * (d) the person is unable to undertake remunerative work for more than 10 hours per week, and rehabilitation is unlikely to increase the person's capacity to undertake remunerative work.

    * (2) The Commission must, as soon as practicable after becoming satisfied that a person meets the eligibility criteria, make the person a written offer of a choice under this Part. The offer must specify the date on which the offer is made.

##### 200  Choice to receive Special Rate Disability Pension

    * (1) A person who is offered the choice under this Division can choose to receive a Special Rate Disability Pension instead of compensation worked out under Division 2 of Part 4.

    * (2) A person who makes the choice cannot change it.

    * (3) However, a person to whom the Commonwealth is no longer liable to pay a Special Rate Disability Pension under section 209 is taken not to have chosen to receive the Pension.

        * Note: This means that the person might still be entitled to compensation worked out under Division 2 of Part 4 or under the Return to Work Scheme in section 210.

##### 201  When the choice is to be made

    * (1) A person who is offered the choice under this Part and who wishes to make the choice must do so within 12 months after the date on which the offer was made.

    * (2) The Commission may, either before or after the end of that period, extend the period within which the person must make the choice if the Commission is satisfied that:

     * (a) there was a delay in the person receiving the offer under subsection 199(2); or

     * (b) the person did not receive the offer.

##### 202  Other requirements for the choice

    * (1) The Commission may, in writing, approve a form for the purposes of this section.

    * (2) A person must make the choice in writing in accordance with the form.

    * (3) Before making the choice, the person must obtain financial advice from a suitably qualified financial adviser in respect of the choice.

        * Note: The person might be entitled to compensation for the cost of the financial advice under section 205.

##### 203  Determinations by Commission

    * (1) The Commission must determine that the Commonwealth is liable to pay a Special Rate Disability Pension to a person instead of compensation worked out under Division 2 of Part 4 if:

     * (a) the person is offered the choice under this Part; and

     * (b) the person makes the choice to receive the pension within the period applicable under section 201 and in accordance with section 202; and

     * (c) the Commission is satisfied that the person meets the eligibility criteria on the day on which the person makes the choice.

    * (2) The Commission must determine that a person is to continue to receive compensation worked out under Division 2 of Part 4 if:

     * (a) the person is offered a choice under this Part; and

     * (b) either:

      * (i) the person does not make the choice within the period applicable under section 201 and in accordance with section 202; or

      * (ii) the Commission is satisfied that the person does not meet the eligibility criteria on the day on which the person makes the choice.

    * (3) If the Commission makes a determination under subsection (1) in relation to a person, a Special Rate Disability Pension is payable to the person instead of compensation worked out under Division 2 of Part 4 from the day on which the Commission becomes aware of the person's choice.

##### 204  Offsets

    * (1) The maximum weekly amount of a Special Rate Disability Pension that could be payable to a person is reduced in accordance with this section.

    * Permanent impairment compensation

    * (2) There is a reduction that is made by reference to amounts payable or paid to the person under Part 2 (permanent impairment). However, a payment received for eligible young persons, financial advice, legal advice or energy supplement under that Part does not reduce the maximum weekly amount of Special Rate Disability Pension that could be payable to the person.

    * (3) The maximum weekly amount of a Special Rate Disability Pension that could be payable to a person is reduced by the sum of:

     * (a) any weekly amounts that are being paid to the person under Part 2; and

     * (b) if the person has chosen to convert all or part of one or more weekly amounts that were payable to the person under that Part to lump sums--those weekly amounts or those parts of those weekly amounts.

    * (4) Subsection (3) applies to a person to whom section 389 or 402 applies as if the person were being paid the weekly amounts under Part 2 that the person would be paid if that section did not apply to the person.

        * Note: Section 389 provides that compensation under Part 2 is not payable to a person who chooses to institute proceedings for damages against the Commonwealth. Under section 402, compensation under this Act is not payable to a person who recovers damages from a third party.

    * Commonwealth superannuation

    * (5) There is a reduction if the person:

     * (a) has retired voluntarily, or has been compulsorily retired, from his or her work; and

     * (b) receives either or both a pension or lump sum under a Commonwealth superannuation scheme as a result of the retirement.

    * (6) The amount of the reduction under subsection (5) is 60% of the reduction that would apply to the person under section 134, 135 or 136 if the person were receiving compensation worked out under Division 2 of Part 4.

    * Relationship with subsection 415(4)

    * (7) This section does not limit the application of subsection 415(4) in relation to a Special Rate Disability Pension.

        * Note: Subsection (7) has the effect that if the maximum weekly amount of a Special Rate Disability Pension is reduced in accordance with this section, that amount may be further reduced in accordance with subsection 415(4).

##### 204A  Overpayment if payment of lump sum under section 138

    * (1) This section applies if the Commission makes a determination under subsection 203(1) in relation to a person where subparagraph 199(1)(a)(iii) applies.

    * (2) An amount, equal to so much of the lump sum under section 138 as is worked out in accordance with a legislative instrument made by the Commission under this subsection, is taken to be an amount of compensation that should not have been paid to the person.

        * Note 1: Section 415 allows the Commission to recover that amount as a debt due to the Commonwealth and allows that amount to be deducted from an amount that is payable under this Act.

        * Note 2: Section 1228 of the _Social Security Act 1991 _provides that amount is recoverable under that Act by means of deductions from payments under that Act.

        * Note 3: Section 205 of the _Veterans' Entitlements Act 1986 _provides that amount is recoverable under that Act by means of deductions from payments under that Act.

    * (4) The amount of $2,400 applies both to financial advice and legal advice under this Part and financial advice and legal advice under Part 2 if the day on which the offer under this Part was made, and the day specified in the first notice given to the person under section 76, are the same.

        * Note: A special rule applies if a trustee is appointed under section 432.

    * (2) An amount paid to the person who gave the advice discharges any liability of any other person for the cost of the advice to the extent of the payment.

##### 208  Persons who are imprisoned

    * (1) The Commission may determine, in writing, a scheme, called the Return to Work Scheme, under which the Commonwealth is liable to pay compensation of a kind mentioned in subsection (2) to a person in circumstances identified in the Return to Work Scheme if:

     * (a) the person:

      * (i) was receiving a Special Rate Disability Pension; and

      * (ii) becomes able to undertake remunerative work for more than 10 hours per week; and

##### 318  Simplified outline of this Part

    * Most benefits under this Act require a claim to have been made under section 319 in respect of a person. This Part sets out the rules that apply in making claims.

    * A claim can be made for: 

        * (a) acceptance of liability for an injury, disease or death; or

        * (b) acceptance of liability for the loss of or damage to a member's medical aid;

        * (c) compensation.

    * The claim can be made by a current or former member who suffered a service injury or disease, a dependant of a deceased member, or a person who is entitled to compensation. A claim can also be made on behalf of such a person.

    * Once a claim is made, the Commission must investigate the claim. As part of this investigation, the Commission can assess the needs of a person who has made a claim for acceptance of liability for a service injury or disease (including by requiring the person to undergo an examination). The Commission decides under section 327 whether the person should be paid compensation for treatment under Part 2 of Chapter 6 or whether the person should be provided with treatment under Part 3 of Chapter 6.

    * The Commission can require information or documents that are relevant to a claim to be provided. The Chief of the Defence Force or a person who has made a claim can require the Commission to provide information or documents that are relevant to a claim.

    * (2) Alternatively, a claim may be made on behalf of such a person:

     * (a) with the person's approval; or

        * Note 1: The legal personal representative cannot convert compensation for permanent impairment to a lump sum (see section 78).

        * Note 2: The legal personal representative of a deceased partner cannot convert compensation for a member's death to a lump sum (see section 236).

    * No claim made before death

    * (3) If a person who is entitled to make a claim under this Act dies before making the claim, the claim may be made on the person's behalf by the person's legal personal representative.

    * (4) The person's legal personal representative can make a claim for any compensation that could have been payable to the person up to the date of death, except compensation under Part 2 of Chapter 4 (permanent impairment).

        * Note: A payment of compensation in respect of a deceased person normally forms part of the estate of the person (see section 436).

    * Claim for acceptance of liability

    * (1) A claim for acceptance of liability for a service injury, disease or death, or the loss of or damage to a medical aid, must not be made if another claim for acceptance of liability for that injury, disease, death, loss or damage has not yet been finally determined.

     * (a) a decision that has been made in respect of the claim is not subject to any form of reconsideration or review; or

     * (b) a decision that has been made in respect of the claim was subject to some form of reconsideration or review, but the period within which such a reconsideration or review could be instituted has ended without a reconsideration or review having been instituted.

##### 323  Giving claims and documents to the Commission

    * The Commission must decide all claims under this Act in accordance with this Part. In deciding claims, the usual technicalities and rules that apply to courts do not apply to the Commission. The standards of proof that apply in determining issues under this Act are found in section 335.

    * There are 2 standards of proof that the Commission applies in deciding matters under this Part (and the rest of the Act).

    * The more beneficial standard of proof (in subsections 335(1) and (2)) only applies to some claims that relate to warlike or nonwarlike service. The other standard of proof (in subsection 335(3)) applies to all other decisions under this Act.

    * This Part also introduces the Statements of Principles regime under sections 338 and 339. For some claims for acceptance of liability for an injury, disease or death the standard of proof can only be met if the injury or disease, or the cause of death, is covered by a Statement of Principles.

    * A Statement of Principles is an instrument made under the _Veterans' Entitlements Act 1986_ (**_VEA_**). The Statement sets out all factors related to defence service that have been found to cause specific injuries, diseases and deaths.

    * The process for making Statements of Principles is found in Part XIA of the VEA. A person who is entitled to a benefit under this Act can apply under the VEA to the Repatriation Medical Authority (**_RMA_**) to investigate a particular injury, disease or death or review one of its previous decisions about a Statement of Principles.

    * Under Part XIB of the VEA, the Specialist Medical Review Council can review decisions of the RMA about Statements of Principles. The Commission can also override an RMA decision about a Statement of Principles under section 340 of this Act.

##### 333  Determination of claims

    * After the Commission has investigated a claim under section 324, the Commission must:

     * (a) consider all matters that, in the Commission's opinion, are relevant to the claim; and

     * (b) determine the claim in writing in accordance with this Act.

        * Note: The Commission is required to give notice of determinations to claimants (see section 346).

##### 334  Commission not bound by technicalities

    * (1) In considering, hearing or determining a claim or request mentioned in subsection (2) and in making a decision in relation to such a claim or request, the Commission:

     * (a) is not bound to act in a formal manner and is not bound by any rules of evidence, but may inform itself on any matter in such manner as it thinks just; and

     * (b) must act according to substantial justice and the substantial merits of the case, without regard to legal form and technicalities; and

     * (c) without limiting paragraphs (a) and (b), must take into account any difficulties that, for any reason, lie in the way of ascertaining the existence of any fact, matter, cause or circumstance, including any reason attributable to:

      * (i) the effects of the passage of time, including the effect of the passage of time on the availability of witnesses; and

      * (ii) the absence of, or a deficiency in, relevant official records, including an absence or deficiency resulting from the fact that an occurrence that happened during the defence service of a member was not reported to the appropriate authorities.

    * (2) Subsection (1) applies to:

     * (a) a claim under section 319; and

     * (b) a request under section 349 for reconsideration of a determination.

##### 335  Standard of proof for Commission and Chief of the Defence Force

    * Standard of proof for claims relating to warlike or nonwarlike service

    * (1) If a claim in respect of subsection 23(1) or (3) or 24(1) for acceptance of liability for a person's injury, disease or death relates to warlike or nonwarlike service rendered by the person while a member, the Commission must determine that the injury is a service injury, that the disease is a service disease, or that the death is a service death, as the case may be, unless it is satisfied, beyond reasonable doubt, that there is no sufficient ground for making that determination.

        * Note: This subsection, to the extent that it relates to subsections 23(1) and 24(1), is affected by section 338.

    * When there is no sufficient ground for making a determination

    * (2) In applying subsection (1) in respect of a person's injury, disease or death, related to service rendered by the person while a member, the Commission must be satisfied, beyond reasonable doubt, that there is no sufficient ground for determining:

     * (a) that the injury is a service injury; or

     * (b) that the disease is a service disease; or

     * (c) that the death is a service death;

    * as the case may be, if the Commission, after consideration of the whole of the material before it, is of the opinion that the material before it does not raise a reasonable hypothesis connecting the injury, disease or death with the circumstances of the particular service rendered by the person while a member.

        * Note: This subsection, to the extent that it relates to subsections 23(1) and 24(1), is affected by section 338.

    * Other determinations to be made to its reasonable satisfaction

    * (3) Except in making a determination to which subsection (1) applies, the Chief of the Defence Force or the Commission must, in making any determination or decision in respect of a matter arising under this Act, the regulations, or any other instrument made under this Act or the regulations, decide the matter to his, her or its reasonable satisfaction.

        * Note: This subsection, to the extent that it relates to subsections 23(1) and 24(1), is affected by section 339.

##### 336  Commission not entitled to make certain presumptions

    * Nothing in section 335, or in any other provision of this Act, entitles the Commission to presume that:

     * (a) an injury sustained by a person is a service injury; or

     * (b) a disease contracted by a person is a service disease; or

     * (c) the death of a person is a service death; or

     * (d) a person is entitled to be granted compensation.

##### 337  No onus of proof

    * Nothing in section 335, or in any other provision of this Act, imposes on:

     * (a) a person claiming compensation or claiming for the acceptance of liability; or

     * (b) the Commission, the Commonwealth, the Department or any other person in relation to such a claim;

    * any onus of proving any matter that is, or might be, relevant to the determination of the claim.

##### 338  Reasonableness of hypothesis to be assessed by reference to Statement of Principles

    * (1) This section applies to a claim under section 319 for acceptance of liability under subsection 23(1) or 24(1) for an injury, disease or death that relates to warlike or nonwarlike service.

        * Note: Subsections 335(1) and (2) are relevant to these claims.

    * (2) If the Repatriation Medical Authority has given notice under section 196G of the _Veterans' Entitlements Act 1986 _that it intends to carry out an investigation in respect of a particular kind of injury, disease or death:

     * (a) the Commission is not to determine a claim for acceptance of liability for a person's injury, disease or death of that kind; and

     * (b) the Commission, the Board or the Tribunal is not to make a decision on the reconsideration or review of:

      * (i) a determination by the Commission on such a claim; or

      * (ii) such a determination as previously affirmed or varied; or

      * (iii) a decision made on a previous review in substitution for a determination referred to in subparagraph (i) or (ii);

    * unless or until the Authority: 

     * (c) has determined a Statement of Principles under subsection 196B(2) of that Act in respect of that kind of injury, disease or death; or

     * (d) has declared that it does not propose to determine such a Statement of Principles.

    * (3) For the purposes of subsection 335(2), a hypothesis connecting an injury sustained, or a disease contracted, by a person, or the death of a person, with the circumstances of any particular service rendered by the person while a member, is reasonable only if there is in force:

     * (a) a Statement of Principles determined under subsection 196B(2) or (11) of the _Veterans' Entitlements Act 1986_; or

     * (b) a determination of the Commission under subsection 340(2) of this Act;

    * that upholds the hypothesis.

        * Note: See subsection (4) about the application of this subsection.

    * (4) Subsection (3) does not apply in relation to a claim for acceptance of liability for a person's injury, disease or death if the Repatriation Medical Authority has neither determined a Statement of Principles under subsection 196B(2) of the _Veterans' Entitlements Act 1986_, nor declared that it does not propose to make such a Statement of Principles, in respect of:

     * (a) the kind of injury sustained by the person; or

     * (b) the kind of disease contracted by the person; or

     * (c) the kind of death met by the person;

    * as the case may be.

##### 339  Reasonable satisfaction to be assessed in certain cases by reference to Statement of Principles

    * (1) This section applies to a claim under section 319 for acceptance of liability under subsection 23(1) or 24(1) for an injury, disease or death that relates to peacetime service.

        * Note: Subsection 335(3) is relevant to these claims.

    * (2) If the Repatriation Medical Authority has given notice under section 196G of the _Veterans' Entitlements Act 1986 _that it intends to carry out an investigation in respect of a particular kind of injury, disease or death:

     * (a) the Commission is not to determine a claim for acceptance of liability for a person's injury, disease or death of that kind; and

     * (b) the Commission, the Board or the Tribunal is not to make a decision on the review of:

      * (i) a determination by the Commission on such a claim; or

      * (ii) such a determination as previously affirmed or varied; or

      * (iii) a decision made on a previous review in substitution for a determination referred to in subparagraph (i) or (ii);

    * unless or until the Authority: 

     * (c) has determined a Statement of Principles under subsection 196B(3) of that Act in respect of that kind of injury, disease or death; or

     * (d) has declared that it does not propose to make such a Statement of Principles.

    * (3) In applying subsection 335(3) to determine a claim, the Commission is to be reasonably satisfied that an injury sustained, or a disease contracted, by a person, or the death of a person, is a service injury, a service disease, or a service death, only if:

     * (a) the material before the Commission raises a connection between the injury, disease or death of the person and some particular defence service rendered by the person while a member; and

     * (b) there is in force:

      * (i) a Statement of Principles determined under subsection 196B(3) or (12) of the _Veterans' Entitlements Act 1986_; or

      * (ii) a determination of the Commission under subsection 340(3) of this Act; and

     * (c) the material, and the Statement of Principles or the determination (as the case may be), upholds the contention that the injury, disease or death of the person is, on the balance of probabilities, connected with that service.

    * (4) Subsection (3) does not apply in relation to a claim for acceptance of liability for a person's injury, disease or death if the Repatriation Medical Authority has neither determined a Statement of Principles under subsection 196B(3) of the _Veterans' Entitlements Act 1986_, nor declared that it does not propose to make such a Statement of Principles, in respect of:

     * (a) the kind of injury sustained by the person; or

     * (b) the kind of disease contracted by the person; or

     * (c) the kind of death met by the person;

    * as the case may be.

##### 340  Determination by Commission overriding Authority's decision in relation to Statements of Principles

    * Commission may make determinations

    * (1) If:

     * (a) the Repatriation Medical Authority has determined, or has declared that it does not propose to make or amend, a Statement of Principles in respect of a particular kind of injury, disease or death (see section 196B of the _Veterans' Entitlements Act 1986_); and

     * (b) the Commission is of the opinion that, because the Statement of Principles is in force, or because of the decision by the Authority not to make or amend the Statement of Principles:

      * (i) claims for acceptance of liability for injuries or diseases of that kind made by members or former members of a particular class; or

      * (ii) claims for acceptance of liability for the deaths of such members or former members made by dependants of those members or former members;

     * cannot succeed; and

     * (c) the Commission is also of the opinion that, in all the circumstances of the case, those persons or their dependants should be entitled to receive compensation under this Act;

    * the Commission may, in its discretion, make a determination in respect of that kind of injury, disease or death under either or both subsections (2) and (3).

    * Requirements for a reasonable hypothesis determination

    * (2) A determination under this subsection in respect of a particular kind of injury, disease or death must:

     * (b) state that it has effect only in relation to the specified class of members; and

     * (c) state that it applies only in respect of claims relating to:

      * (i) warlike service; or

      * (ii) nonwarlike service; and

     * (d) set out:

      * (i) the factors that must as a minimum exist; and

      * (ii) which of those factors must be related to service rendered by a member;

     * before it can be said that a reasonable hypothesis has been raised connecting an injury, disease or death of that kind with the circumstances of that service.

    * Requirements for a reasonable satisfaction determination

    * (3) A determination under this subsection in respect of a particular kind of injury, disease or death must:

    * Determination is a legislative instrument

    * (4) A determination under subsection (2) or (3) is a legislative instrument.

    * Effect of reasonable hypothesis determination

    * (5) While there is in force under subsection (2) a determination in respect of a particular kind of injury, disease or death, any Statement of Principles in force under subsection 196B(2) of the _Veterans' Entitlements Act 1986 _in respect of that kind of injury, disease or death does not apply in respect of any person in relation to whom the determination has effect.

    * Effect of reasonable satisfaction determination

    * (6) While there is in force under subsection (3) a determination in respect of a particular kind of injury, disease or death, any Statement of Principles in force under subsection 196B(3) of the _Veterans' Entitlements Act 1986 _in respect of that kind of injury, disease or death does not apply in respect of any person in relation to whom the determination has effect.

    * Definition of **related to service**

    * **	(7)	A factor causing, or contributing to, an injury, disease or death is **_related to service_** rendered by a member if:

     * (b) it arose out of, or was attributable to, that service; or

     * (c) it was contributed to in a material degree by, or was aggravated by, that service; or

     * (d) in the case of a factor causing, or contributing to, an injury--it resulted from an accident that would not have occurred:

     * (f) in the case of a factor causing, or contributing to, the death of a member--it was due to an accident that would not have occurred, or to a disease that would not have been contracted:

      * (i) but for the rendering of that service by the member; or

      * (ii) but for changes in the member's environment consequent upon his or her having rendered that service; or

## Chapter 8--Reconsideration and review of determinations

### Part 1--Preliminary

##### 344  Simplified outline of this Chapter

    * Most determinations made by the Commission (the **_original determinations_**) can be reconsidered and reviewed. This also applies to decisions of the Chief of the Defence Force about rehabilitation.

    * The Commission or the Chief of the Defence Force must give notice of an original determination to the claimant. The notice must set out the terms of and the reasons for the determination and the claimant's rights to apply for reconsideration or review.

    * There are 2 possible paths in the reconsideration and review process depending on the type of reconsideration sought by the claimant.

    * A claimant who has received notice of an original determination can ask the Commission to reconsider it or ask the Veterans' Review Board to review it. If dissatisfied with the determination on reconsideration or review (the **_reviewable determination_**), the claimant can apply to the Administrative Appeals Tribunal for review of the reviewable determination.

    * The Commission or the Chief of the Defence Force can also initiate reconsideration of original determinations made by the Commission or the Chief of the Defence Force.

    * (1) This section modifies the way this Chapter applies in relation to a decision by the Commission that is only about a person's entitlement to a clean energy payment.

    * (2) This Chapter applies to the person in the same way as it applies to a claimant. However, this does not affect the following provisions:

     * (a) an amount of compensation paid or payable under Part 2 of Chapter 4 has been worked out using Chapter 25 of the guide referred to in section 67, being the guide as in force before 1 July 2013; and

     * (b) a reviewable determination has been made, or the Tribunal has made a decision in a review under Part 5 of this Chapter, in relation to that compensation;

    * then the Commission may, on its own initiative, review the amount of that compensation using Chapter 25 of that guide, being that guide as in force when the review is conducted.

        * Note: The Commission's powers under this section are in addition to its powers under section 347 to reconsider original determinations it makes in relation to compensation under Part 2 of Chapter 4.

    * Part 2 prohibits actions against the Commonwealth for the compensable loss. However, it allows the person a choice to take action against the Commonwealth to recover limited damages for noneconomic loss.

    * Part 3 deals with payment or recovery of compensation under this Act if damages are recovered from a third party. It also allows the Commission to make or take over claims in certain cases.

##### 387  Interpretation

    * (1) In this Chapter:

    * **_potentially liable member_**, in relation to an action or other proceeding, means a person who was, when the cause of action arose, acting in the capacity of a member.

    * (2) Unless the contrary intention appears, a reference in this Chapter to a person is, if the person has died, a reference to his or her legal personal representative.

### Part 2--Liability of the Commonwealth to other actions

     * (a) a service injury sustained, or a service disease contracted, by another member or a former member; or

     * (b) the loss of, or damage to, a medical aid used by another member.

        * Note: However, a person may choose to institute an action for damages for noneconomic loss against the Commonwealth or the potentially liable member under section 389.

    * (2) Subsection (1) applies whether that injury, disease, loss or damage occurred before or after this section commences. However, subsection (1) does not apply if an action or proceeding in respect of the injury, disease, loss or damage is instituted before this section commences.
