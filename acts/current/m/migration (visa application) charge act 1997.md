### An Act to impose a charge in respect of applications for visas


    * 1**  Short title **[_see_ Note 1]

    * This Act may be cited as the _Migration (Visa Application) Charge Act 1997_.

    * 2**  Commencement **[_see_ Note 1]

    * (1) This Act commences on a day to be fixed by Proclamation.

    * (2) If this Act does not commence under subsection (1) within 6 months beginning on the day on which it receives the Royal Assent, it commences on the first day after the end of that period.

##### 3  Act to extend to certain territories

    * (1) This Act extends to the territories to which the _Migration Act 1958_ extends.

    * (2) Visa application charge is payable in relation to a visa application whether the application is made inside Australia or outside Australia.

##### 3A  Definitions

    * In this Act, unless the contrary intention appears:

    * **_contributory parent visa_** means a permanent or temporary visa included in a class of visas under regulations made under the _Migration Act 1958_, being a class that has the words "contributory parent" or "contributory aged parent" in its title.

    * **_Contributory Parent Visa Composite Index_** means the Contributory Parent Visa Composite Index, expressed as a percentage, published by the Australian Government Actuary for a financial year.

##### 4  Imposition of visa application charge

    * Visa application charge payable under section 45A of the _Migration Act 1958_ is imposed.

##### 5  The visa application charge limit--most visas

    * (1) The charge limit in relation to a visa application made during the financial year beginning on 1 July 1996 is $12,500, unless the visa application is for a contributory parent visa.

    * (2) The charge limit for a later financial year is calculated by multiplying the charge limit for the financial year before the later year by the greater of 1.0 or the indexation factor worked out using the following formula:

    * 

    * where: 

    * **_CPI quarter_** means a period of 3 months ending on 31 March, 30 June, 30 September or 31 December.

    * **_index number_** means the All Groups Consumer Price Index number (being the weighted average of the 8 capital cities) published by the Australian Statistician.

    * (3) The indexation factor is to be calculated to 3 decimal places, but increased by .001 if the 4th decimal place is more than 4.

    * (4) Calculations under subsection (2):

     * (a) are to be made using only the index numbers published in terms of the most recently published reference base for the Consumer Price Index; and

     * (b) are to disregard index numbers that are published in substitution for previously published index numbers (except where the substituted numbers are published to take account of changes in the reference base).

    * (5) If an amount worked out under the formula in subsection (2) is not a multiple of $5, the amount is to be rounded as follows:

     * (a) if the amount exceeds the nearest lower multiple of $5 by $2.50 or more--round the amount up to the nearest higher multiple of $5;

     * (b) in any other case--round the amount down to the nearest lower multiple of $5.

##### 6  The visa application charge limit--contributory parent visas

    * _Financial year beginning 1 July 2002_

    * _	(1)	The charge limit in relation to a visa application for a contributory parent visa made during the financial year beginning on 1 July 2002 is $26,745.

    * _Later financial years_

    * _	(2)	The charge limit for a later financial year is the amount worked out under subsection (3) or (5), depending on the amount of the Contributory Parent Visa Composite Index for the later financial year.

    * _Contributory Parent Visa Composite Index more than zero_

    * _	(3)	If the Contributory Parent Visa Composite Index for the later financial year is more than zero, the charge limit for that financial year is the amount worked out using the following formula, then rounded under subsection (4):



    * **_previous charge limit_** means the charge limit for the financial year before the later financial year.

    * (4) If an amount worked out under the formula in subsection (3) is not a multiple of $5, the amount is to be rounded as follows:

     * (a) if the amount exceeds the nearest lower multiple of $5 by $2.50 or more--round the amount up to the nearest higher multiple of $5;

     * (b) in any other case--round the amount down to the nearest lower multiple of $5.

    * _Contributory Parent Visa Composite Index zero or less_

    * _	(5)	If the Contributory Parent Visa Composite Index for the later financial year is zero or less, the charge limit for the later financial year is the same as the charge limit for the financial year before the later financial year.
