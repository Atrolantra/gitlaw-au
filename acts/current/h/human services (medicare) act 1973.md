    * (2) Subsection (1) does not authorise the conferral of a function, or the imposition of a duty, by a law of a State or Territory to the extent to which:

    * (2) The duty is taken not to be imposed by this Act (or any other law of the Commonwealth) to the extent to which:

     * (a) imposing the duty is within the legislative powers of the State or Territory concerned; and

     * (b) imposing the duty by the law of the State or Territory is consistent with the constitutional doctrines restricting the duties that may be imposed on the Chief Executive Medicare.

    * Commonwealth legislative power sufficient to support duty but State or Territory legislative powers are not

    * (3) If, to ensure the validity of the purported imposition of the duty, it is necessary that the duty be imposed by a law of the Commonwealth (rather than by the law of the State or Territory), the duty is taken to be imposed by this Act to the extent necessary to ensure that validity.

    * (4) If, because of subsection (3), this Act is taken to impose the duty, it is the intention of the Parliament to rely on all powers available to it under the Constitution to support the imposition of the duty by this Act.

    * (5) The duty is taken to be imposed by this Act in accordance with subsection (3) only to the extent to which imposing the duty:

     * (a) is within the legislative powers of the Commonwealth; and

     * (b) is consistent with the constitutional doctrines restricting the duties that may be imposed on the Chief Executive Medicare.

##### 8AF   and Territory laws impose a duty on Chief Executive Medicare

    * For the purposes of sections 8AD and 8AE, a law of a State or Territory **_imposes a duty_** on the Chief Executive Medicare if:
