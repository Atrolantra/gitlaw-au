##### 4  ASIC entitled to custody of certain original records of the HIH Royal Commission

  * (1) ASIC is, by force of this section, entitled to the custody of records that:

   * (a) are deemed, by subsection 22(2) of the _Archives Act 1983_, to be Commonwealth records for the purposes of that Act; and

   * (b) are documents or things that were produced to the HIH Royal Commission;

  * as if a direction to that effect were in force under subsection 22(3) of the _Archives Act 1983_ at all times after the commencement of this Act.

    * Note: This subsection applies to documents or things that were actually produced to the HIH Royal Commission. For the obligation to provide ASIC with electronic copies of such documents or things, see section 5.

  * (2) The Commonwealth must ensure that the records to which subsection (1) applies are provided or made available to ASIC as soon as practicable after the commencement of this Act.

##### 5  ASIC to be provided with electronic copies of certain records of the HIH Royal Commission

  * If: 

   * (a) the Commonwealth has an electronic version of a document or thing that was produced to the HIH Royal Commission (whether or not subsection 4(1) applies to the document or thing itself); and

   * (b) the electronic version is deemed, by subsection 22(2) of the _Archives Act 1983_, to be a Commonwealth record for the purposes of that Act;

  * the Commonwealth must ensure that an electronic copy of that electronic version, and of any associated objective coding data, is provided or made available to ASIC as soon as practicable after the commencement of this Act.

##### 6  Regulations may provide for ASIC's access to other records of the HIH Royal Commission

##### 9  No loss of legal professional privilege

  * A transferred record, or material in or referred to in a transferred record, does not cease to be the subject of legal professional privilege merely because:
