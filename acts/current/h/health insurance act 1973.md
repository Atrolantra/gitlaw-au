     * (a) the medical expenses incurred in respect of a relevant service for which the claim is made;

    * reduced by: 

     * (b) any amounts payable under any other section of this Act in respect of those expenses.

    * (5) This section applies to the current claim if:

     * (a) the current claim is a claim that is made by the person for a benefit in respect of a relevant service which was rendered to the person; and

     * (b) the medical expenses incurred in respect of the relevant service are incurred in a year (the **_expense year_**); and

     * (c) the person has paid at least 20% of the outofpocket expenses for the service directly to the person by whom, or on whose behalf, the service was rendered; and

     * (d) the current claim is accepted by the Chief Executive Medicare; and

     * (e) one or more of the following apply to the claim:

      * (i) the person is a concessional person in relation to the expense year at the time that the claim is made and the concessional safetynet applies to the current claim;

      * (ii) the extended general safetynet applies to the current claim.

    * (6) A safetynet mentioned in paragraph (5)(e) applies to the current claim if the Chief Executive Medicare is satisfied at the time when the current claim was accepted for payment that the sum of the outofpocket expenses for the current claim and all relevant prior claims for the expense year is equal to or exceeds the applicable safetynet amount.

    * (7) A claim is a **_relevant prior claim_** for the expense year if:

     * (a) the claim has been made for benefit in respect of relevant services which were rendered to the person; and

     * (b) the claim is related to medical expenses incurred during the expense year; and

     * (c) the claim was accepted for payment by the Chief Executive Medicare before the time when the current claim was accepted for payment; and

     * (d) the Chief Executive Medicare is satisfied at the time when the current claim was accepted for payment that the outofpocket expenses for the claim have been paid.

    * (8) If:

     * (a) this section applies to the current claim; but

     * (b) the sum of the outofpocket expenses for all relevant prior claims for the expense year is less than the applicable safetynet amount;

    * the benefit payable in respect of the claim is not increased under subsection (3) but is instead increased by the amount worked out using the formula:

    * where: 

    * **_balance of safetynet_** means the amount by which the sum of the outofpocket expenses for all relevant prior claims for the expense year is less than the applicable safetynet amount.

    * (8A) Despite subsections (3) and (8), if the current claim is for a service specified in an item determined under section 10B to be an item to which this subsection applies, the increase under this section in the benefit payable in respect of the claim cannot exceed the amount determined under section 10B as the maximum increase for that item.

        * Note: This subsection does not limit the increase payable in respect of a claim for a service specified in an item not determined under section 10B to be an item to which this subsection applies.

    * (8AA) If:

     * (a) 2 or more services (the **_original services_**) that are each specified in an item are deemed to constitute, or are treated as, one service (the **_deemed service_**) under this Act (other than a provision of this Act prescribed by the regulations); and

     * (b) all of the items in which the original services are specified are items determined under section 10B to be items to which subsection (8A) of this section applies; and

     * (c) the current claim is for the deemed service;

    * then, despite subsections (3) and (8) of this section, the increase under this section in the benefit payable in respect of the claim cannot exceed the sum of the amounts determined under section 10B as the maximum increases for those items.

        * Note: For when 2 or more services are deemed to constitute one service, see sections 15 and 16.

    * (8B) If:

     * (a) for the purposes of the pathology services table:

      * (i) 2 or more pathology services are treated as a single pathology service; and

      * (ii) the fee for the single service is the fee specified in one or more particular items in the table; and

     * (b) one or more of those particular items (the **_limited increase items_**) are items determined under section 10B to be items to which subsection (8A) of this section applies;

    * then, for the purposes of that subsection, the single service is taken to be specified in the limited increase item or, if there are 2 or more limited increase items, in the one of those items for which the maximum increase determined under section 10B is the greatest.

        * Note: Section 4B lets regulations provide for a rule of interpretation of the pathology services table to treat 2 or more pathology services as a single pathology service.

    * (9) For the purposes of this section (other than paragraph (5)(c)), without affecting the meaning of an expression in any other provision of this Act, if a person to whom benefit is payable in respect of a relevant service is given or sent a cheque under subsection 20(2) or (2A) for the amount of the benefit, the person is taken to have paid so much of the medical expenses in respect of that service as is represented by the amount of the benefit.

    * (10) For the purposes of this section, without affecting the meaning of an expression in any other provision of this Act, despite anything else in this Act, the question when medical expenses are incurred in respect of relevant services relating to prescribed items is to be determined under the regulations.

##### 10AE  Confirmation of family composition

    * (1) If the Chief Executive Medicare is satisfied that, apart from this section, a registered family would be, or would be likely soon to become, entitled to increased benefits under subsection 10AC or 10ACA in respect of a calendar year, the Chief Executive Medicare must request that the person who registered the family or another family member state, in a manner approved by the Chief Executive Medicare, whether or not:

     * (a) the composition of the family remains, or (if the year has already ended) remained, in that year, as originally registered under section 10AA; or

     * (b) if, after the registration, the Chief Executive Medicare has been notified of a change in the family composition--the composition of the family remains, or (if that year has already ended) remained, in that year, as last notified to the Chief Executive Medicare.

    * (2) Until a family member provides the information sought under subsection (1), then, despite section 10AC or 10ACA, increased benefits are not payable in respect of the family members in respect of the year for which the confirmation was sought.

##### 10A  Indexation

    * (1) In this section:

    * **_index number_**, in relation to a quarter, means the All Groups Consumer Price Index number that is the weighted average of the 8 capital cities and is published by the Australian Statistician in respect of that quarter.

    * **_year_** means:

     * (b) for the purpose of the indexation of the amount of the greatest permissible gap--the year beginning on 1 November 1992 or a later year beginning on 1 November; or

     * (c) for the purpose of the indexation of the safetynet amount--the year beginning on 1 January 1993 or a later year beginning on 1 January; or

     * (d) for the purpose of the indexation of the concessional safetynet amount, the FTB(A) safetynet amount and the extended general safetynet amount--the year beginning on 1 January 2007 or a later year beginning on 1 January.

        * Note 1: greatest permissible gap is defined in subsection 10(5).

    * (2) The amount referred to in an item in the CPI Indexation Table below is to be indexed under this section every year on the indexation day specified in that item by using the reference quarter in that item.

    * (3) Where an amount is to be indexed on an indexation day, this Act has effect as if the indexed amount were substituted for that amount on that day.

    * (4) The indexed amount for an amount to be indexed is:

     * (a) the amount worked out by multiplying the amount to be indexed by the indexation factor for that amount; or

     * (b) if the amount worked out under paragraph (a) is not a multiple of 10 cents--that amount rounded down to the nearest multiple of 10 cents. 

    * (5) Subject to subsections (6), (7) and (8), the indexation factor for an amount to be indexed on an indexation day is the amount worked out by using the formula:

    * where: 

    * **_Most recent index number_** means the index number for the last quarter before the indexation day that is a reference quarter for the indexation of the amount; and

    * **_Previous index number_**, in relation to the indexation of an amount referred to in an item in the CPI Indexation Table in subsection (2), means the index number for the reference quarter in that item immediately before the most recent reference quarter in that item ending before the indexation day.

    * (6) An indexation factor is to be worked out to 3 decimal places.

    * (7) If an indexation factor worked out under subsections (5) and (6) would, if it were worked out to 4 decimal places, end in a number that is greater than 4, the indexation factor is to be increased by 0.001.

    * (8) If an indexation factor worked out under subsections (5), (6) and (7) would be less than 1, the indexation factor is to be increased to 1.

    * (9) Subject to subsection (10), if at any time (whether before or after the commencement of this section), the Australian Statistician publishes an index number for a quarter in substitution for an index number previously published by the Statistician for that quarter, the publication of the later index number is to be disregarded for the purposes of this section.

    * (10) If at any time (whether before or after the commencement of this section) the Australian Statistician changes the reference base for the Consumer Price Index, regard is to be had, for the purposes of applying this section after the change takes place, only to index numbers published in terms of the new reference base.

##### 10B  Determinations for subsections 10ACA(7A) and 10ADA(8A)

    * (1) The Minister may by legislative instrument do either or both of the following:

     * (a) determine that subsections 10ACA(7A) and 10ADA(8A) apply to specified items;

     * (b) determine amounts as the maximum increases for items to which subsections 10ACA(7A) and 10ADA(8A) are determined to apply.

        * Note: For specification by class, see subsection 13(3) of the _Legislative Instruments Act 2003_.

     * (a) the amount specified in those items as fees, other than the greater or greatest of those amounts, shall be deemed to be reduced, as follows:

      * (i) the greater or greatest of the amounts to be deemed to be reduced shall be deemed to be reduced by onehalf; and

      * (ii) the other amount, or each of the other amounts, to be deemed to be reduced shall be deemed to be reduced by threequarters; and

    * (2) For the purposes of paragraph (1)(a):

     * (a) where two or more amounts referred to in that subsection are equal, one of those amounts shall be treated as being greater than the other or others of those amounts; and

     * (b) where, by virtue of a reduction in accordance with that subsection, an amount is not a multiple of 5 cents, the amount of cents shall be increased to the nearest higher amount that is a multiple of 5 cents.

    * (3) This section does not apply in relation to an operation, being one of two or more operations performed under the one anaesthetic on the one person, if the practitioner who performed the operation:

     * (a) did not perform, or assist at, the other operation or any of the other operations; and

     * (b) did not administer the anaesthetic.

    * the amount of medicare benefit payable in respect of that professional service is the same whether the assistance is rendered, or the anaesthetic is administered, by one or more than one practitioner.

    * (4) For the purpose of ascertaining whether medicare benefit is payable, or calculating the amount of a medicare benefit payable, in respect of the medical expenses incurred in respect of the administration of an anaesthetic to a person for the purposes of two or more operations performed on that person while he or she is under that anaesthetic:

     * (a) the amounts specified as fees in the items that relate to the administration of an anaesthetic for the purposes of those operations, other than the greater or greatest of those amounts, shall be deemed to be reduced as prescribed; and

    * (5) For the purposes of paragraph (4)(a):

     * (a) where two or more amounts referred to in that subsection are equal, one of those amounts shall be treated as being greater than the other or others of those amounts; and

### Part VAA--The Professional Services Review Scheme

#### Division 1--Preliminary

##### 79A  Object of this Part

    * The object of this Part is to protect the integrity of the Commonwealth medicare benefits, dental benefits and pharmaceutical benefits programs and, in doing so:

     * (a) protect patients and the community in general from the risks associated with inappropriate practice; and

     * (b) protect the Commonwealth from having to meet the cost of services provided as a result of inappropriate practice.

##### 80  Main features of the Professional Services Review Scheme

    * (1) This section summarises the main features of the Professional Services Review Scheme established by this Part.

    * (2) The Professional Services Review Scheme is a scheme for reviewing and investigating the provision of services by a person to determine whether the person has engaged in inappropriate practice.

    * (3) The Chief Executive Medicare can request the Director to review the provision of services by a person and the Director must decide whether to undertake a review.

    * (4) Following a review, the Director must:

     * (a) decide to take no further action in relation to the review; or

     * (b) enter into an agreement with the person under review; or

     * (c) make a referral to a Committee.

    * (5) If the Director enters into an agreement with the person under review, the agreement must be ratified by the Determining Authority before it takes effect. Having an agreement ratified avoids a Committee investigation.

    * (6) A referral to a Committee initiates an investigation by the Committee into the provision of the services specified in the referral. The Committee can investigate any aspect of the provision of the referred services and its investigation is not limited by any reasons given in a request for review or a Director's report following a review.

    * (7) Committee members must belong to professions or specialities relevant to the investigation.

    * (8) Committees can hold hearings and require the person under review to attend and give evidence. Committees also have the power to require the production of documents (including clinical records).

    * (9) Committees can base findings on investigations of samples of services.

    * (10) If a Committee finds that the person under review has engaged in inappropriate practice, the finding will be reported to the Determining Authority. The Determining Authority decides what action to take.

    * (11) Provision is made throughout the scheme for the person under review to make submissions before key decisions are made or final reports are given.

    * (12) A Committee cannot make a finding of inappropriate practice unless it has given the person under review:

     * (a) notice of its intention to do so; and

     * (b) the reasons for the finding; and

     * (c) an opportunity to respond.

##### 80A  Additional operation of this Part

    * (1) Without prejudice to the effect that this Part has apart from this subsection, this Part also has the effect that it would have if paragraphs 92(2)(b) and 106U(1)(ca) and (cb) were, by express provision, confined in their operation to the circumstance where the medicare benefit or dental benefit had been paid to the person under review as a result of an assignment to that person of the right to payment of the benefit.

    * (2) Without prejudice to the effect that this Part has apart from this subsection, this Part also has the effect that it would have if paragraphs 92(2)(b) and 106U(1)(ca) and (cb) were, by express provision, confined in their operation to the circumstance where the person under review rendered a bill for the services for which the medicare benefit or dental benefit was paid.
