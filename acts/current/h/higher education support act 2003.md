    * This Chapter provides for who are higher education providers, and for 3 kinds of grants to be made.

    * Part 21 sets out who are higher education providers (universities, selfaccrediting entities and non selfaccrediting entities), the quality and accountability requirements for higher education providers and how bodies cease to be higher education providers.

     *  	grants under Part 22 (Commonwealth Grant Scheme) to certain higher education providers. These grants are paid in relation to Commonwealth supported places. Grants are made subject to conditions; and

     *  	other grants under Part 23 to higher education providers and other bodies corporate for a variety of purposes; and

     *  	grants for Commonwealth scholarships to certain higher education providers under Part 24.

    * A body's approval as a higher education provider may be revoked in circumstances such as breach of a quality and accountability requirement.

     * (a) the amount for *designated courses of study (see subsection (3)); and

     * (b) the amount for *nondesignated courses of study (see subsections (5) and (6)).

    * Table A providers--amount for designated courses of study

     * (a) the sum of the amounts worked out, for each *funding cluster in which the provider has provided places in *designated courses of study, by multiplying:

      * (i) the *number of Commonwealth supported places provided by the provider in designated courses of study in that funding cluster; by

      * (ii) the *Commonwealth contribution amount for a place in that funding cluster; and

     * (b) either:

    * Table A providers--amount for nondesignated courses of study

    * (5) For the purposes of paragraph (2)(b) and subject to subsection (6), the amount for *nondesignated courses of study is the lesser of:

     * (a) the sum of the amounts worked out, for each *funding cluster in which the provider has provided places in nondesignated courses of study, by multiplying:

      * (i) the *number of Commonwealth supported places provided by the provider in nondesignated courses of study in that funding cluster; by

      * (ii) the *Commonwealth contribution amount for a place in that funding cluster; and

     * (b) the *maximum basic grant amount specified in the provider's funding agreement in relation to nondesignated courses of study.

    * (6) If a *maximum basic grant amount is not specified in the provider's funding agreement in relation to *nondesignated courses of study, the amount for nondesignated courses of study is the amount worked out under paragraph (5)(a).

    * Basic grant amounts for nonTable A providers

    * (7) For a provider that is not a *Table A provider, the *basic grant amount for a year is the lesser of:

     * (a) the sum of the amounts worked out, for each *funding cluster in which the provider has provided places, by multiplying:

      * (ii) the *Commonwealth contribution amount for a place in that funding cluster; and

     * (b) either:

      * (i) if there is a *maximum basic grant amount specified in the provider's funding agreement--that specified amount; or

      * (ii) if there is no maximum basic grant amount specified in the provider's funding agreement--the amount worked out under subsection (8).

    * (8) For the purposes of subparagraph (7)(b)(ii), the amount is the sum of the amounts worked out, for each *funding cluster to which the Minister has allocated places to the provider under section 3010, by multiplying:

     * (a) the *number of Commonwealth supported places allocated to that funding cluster; by

     * (b) the *Commonwealth contribution amount for a place in that funding cluster.

        * (a) the *EFTSL value of the unit; by

        * (b) the number of persons enrolled with the provider in that unit as *Commonwealth supported students.

      * Step 2.	Add together all of the amounts worked out under step 1.

    * (2) For the purposes of this section, if:

     * (a) a unit of study provided by the provider forms part of more than one *course of study; and

     * (b) the provider determines under subsection 16928(2) an *EFTSL value of the unit for each such course;

##### 3335  Funding clusters in which units of study are included

    * The Commonwealth Grant Scheme Guidelines may specify: 

     * (a) how to determine, for the purposes of this Act, the *funding clusters in which units of study are included; or

    * where: 

    * **_reduction amount_** is $100.

        * Note: The reduction amount is indexed under Part 56.

    * **_total places provided_** is the total *number of Commonwealth supported places provided by the higher education provider for the grant year.

        * The upfront payment exceeded $500 so there is a HECSHELP discount of $100 (oneninth of $900). The Commonwealth lends to Robert the remainder of the HECSHELP assistance, an amount of $1,745 ($1,845 minus $100).

##### 9610  Payments to higher education providers--full upfront payment of student contribution amount

        * Note: Incurring that financial year's accumulated HELP debt discharges the previous accumulated HELP debt and HELP debts under this Part: see section 14035.

##### Subdivision 140B--Former accumulated HELP debts

##### 1405  Working out a former accumulated HELP debt

    * (1) A person's **_former accumulated HELP debt_**, in relation to the person's *accumulated HELP debt for a financial year, is worked out by multiplying:

     * (a) the amount worked out using the following method statement; by

     * (b) the *HELP debt indexation factor for 1 June in that financial year.

Method statement

      * Step 1.	Take the person's *accumulated HELP debt for the immediately preceding financial year. (This amount is taken to be zero if the person has no accumulated HELP debt for that financial year.)

      * Step 2.	Take the HELP debts (if any) that the person incurred during the last 6 months of the immediately preceding financial year. Group them according to whether the debts are in relation to:

        * (a) units undertaken with a higher education provider that formed part of one particular *course of study with that provider; or

        * (b) units undertaken with a higher education provider that formed part of one particular course of study with another higher education provider; or

        * (c) units that formed part of one particular *bridging course for overseastrained professionals; or

        * (d) units access to which was provided by *Open Universities ; or

        * (e) *OSHELP assistance, the entitlement to which relates to the person's enrolment in a *course of study with one particular higher education provider (see paragraph 1181(1)(c)); or

        * (ea) *SAHELP assistance for *student services and amenities fees imposed on the person by one particular higher education provider; or

        * (f) units undertaken with a *VET provider that formed part of one particular *VET course of study with that provider; or

        * (g) units undertaken with a VET provider that formed part of one particular VET course of study with another VET provider.

           * Note: There will be more than one group of debts under paragraph (a) if the person incurred debts in relation to more than one course of study with a provider. Similarly, there could be more than one group of debts under paragraph (b), (c), (e), (ea), (f) or (g).

      * Step 2A.	Work out the total for each group of debts. If the total for a particular group is an amount consisting of a number of whole dollars and a number of cents, the total for that group is taken to be the number of whole dollars. If the total for a group is an amount of less than one dollar, the total for the group is taken to be zero.

      * Step 2B.	If there is more than one group of debts for the person, add together the totals for all of the groups.

      * Step 3.	Subtract the sum of the amounts by which the person's debts referred to above are reduced because of any *voluntary repayments that have been made during the period:

        * (a) starting on 1 June in the immediately preceding financial year; and

        * (b) ending immediately before the next 1 June.

      * Step 4.	Subtract the sum of all of the person's *compulsory repayment amounts that:

        * (a) were assessed during that period (excluding any assessed as a result of a *return given before that period); or

        * (b) were assessed after the end of that period as a result of a return given before the end of that period.

      * Step 4A.	In respect of that period, subtract the amount of *HECSHELP benefit (if any) determined, in respect of the person, by the *Commissioner under section 15720 for an *income year, if the person did not have any *compulsory repayment amounts for that year.

      * Step 5.	Subtract the sum of the amounts by which any *compulsory repayment amount of the person is increased (whether as a result of an increase in the person's *taxable income of an *income year or otherwise) by an amendment of an assessment made during that period.

      * Step 6.	Add the sum of the amounts by which any *compulsory repayment amount of the person is reduced (whether as a result of a reduction in the person's *taxable income of an *income year or otherwise) by an amendment of an assessment made during that period.

        * Example: Lorraine is studying parttime for a Degree of Bachelor of Communications. On 1 June 2011, Lorraine had an accumulated HELP debt of $15,000. She incurred a HELP debt of $1,500 on 31 March 2011. She made a voluntary repayment of $525 (which includes a voluntary repayment bonus of $25) on 1 May 2012. Lorraine lodged her 201011 income tax return and a compulsory repayment amount of $3,000 was assessed and notified on her income tax notice of assessment on 3 September 2011.

        * To work out Lorraine's former accumulated HELP debt before indexation on 1 June 2012:

        * Step 1: Take the previous accumulated HELP debt of $15,000 on 1 June 2011.

        * Step 2: Add the HELP debt of $1,500 incurred on 31 March 2011.

        * Step 3: Subtract the $525 voluntary repayment made on 1 May 2012.

        * Step 4: Subtract the $3,000 compulsory repayment assessed on 3 September 2011.

        * Step 4A: Does not apply because Lorraine does not satisfy the eligibility requirements for the HECSHELP benefit.

        *  Steps 5 and 6: Do not apply because since 1 June 2011 Lorraine had no amendments to any assessment.

        * Lorraine's former accumulated HELP debt before indexation on 1 June 2012 is:

        * If, for example, the indexation factor for 1 June 2012 were 1.030, then the former accumulated HELP debt would be:

    * (2) For the purposes of this section, an assessment, or an amendment of an assessment, is taken to have been made on the day specified in the notice of assessment, or notice of amended assessment, as the date of issue of that notice.

    * (3) If a determination by the *Commissioner under section 15720 is reviewed under Part 57:

     * (a) the reference in step 4A of the method statement in subsection (1) to the determination includes a reference to the decision on review; and

     * (b) to the extent that the decision on review affects any step in the method statement--the decision on review must be taken into account in working out a person's *former accumulated HELP debt under this section.

##### 14010  HELP debt indexation factor

    * (1) The **_HELP debt indexation factor_** for 1 June in a financial year is the number (rounded to 3 decimal places) worked out as follows:

Method statement

      * Step 1.	Add:

        * (a) the *index number for the *quarter ending on 31 March in that financial year; and

        * (b) the index numbers for the 3 quarters that immediately preceded that quarter.

      * Step 2.	Add:

        * (a) the *index number for the *quarter ending on 31 March in the immediately preceding financial year; and

        * (b) the index numbers for the 3 quarters that immediately preceded that quarter.

      * Step 3.	The **_HELP debt indexation factor_** for 1 June in the financial year is the amount under step 1 divided by the amount under step 2.

    * (2) For the purposes of rounding a *HELP debt indexation factor, the third decimal place is rounded up if, apart from the rounding:

     * (a) the factor would have 4 or more decimal places; and

     * (b) the fourth decimal place would be a number greater than 4.

##### 14015  Index numbers

    * (1) The **_index number_** for a *quarter is the All Groups Consumer Price Index number, being the weighted average of the 8 capital cities, published by the *Australian Statistician in respect of that quarter.

    * (2) Subject to subsection (3), if, at any time before or after the commencement of this Act:

     * (a) the *Australian Statistician has published or publishes an *index number in respect of a *quarter; and

     * (b) that index number is in substitution for an index number previously published by the Australian Statistician in respect of that quarter;

    * disregard the publication of the later index for the purposes of this section.

    * (3) If, at any time before or after the commencement of this Act, the *Australian Statistician has changed or changes the reference base for the Consumer Price Index, then, in applying this section after the change took place or takes place, have regard only to *index numbers published in terms of the new reference base.

##### 14020  Publishing HELP debt indexation factors

    * The *Commissioner must cause to be published before 1 June in each financial year the *HELP debt indexation factor for that 1 June.

##### Subdivision 140C--Accumulated HELP debts

##### 14025  Working out an accumulated HELP debt

    * (1) A person's **_accumulated HELP debt_**, for a financial year, is worked out as follows:

    * where: 

    * **_former accumulated HELP debt_** is the person's *former accumulated HELP debt in relation to that *accumulated HELP debt.

    * **_HELP debt repayments_** is the sum of all of the *voluntary repayments (if any) paid, on or after 1 July in the financial year and before 1 June in that year, in reduction of the *HELP debts incurred in that year.

    * **_HELP debts incurred_** means the amount worked out using the method statement in subsection (1A).

        * Example: Paula is studying parttime for a Degree of Bachelor of Science. On 1 June 2009, her former accumulated HELP debt was worked out using Subdivision 140B to be $20,000. She incurred a HELP debt of $1,500 on 31 August 2008. No repayments have been made in the 12 months from 1 June 2008.

        * Paula's accumulated HELP debt on 1 June 2009 is worked out by taking her former accumulated HELP debt of $20,000 and adding the $1,500 HELP debt incurred on 31 August 2008. That is:

    * (1A) For the purposes of the definition of **_HELP debts incurred _**in subsection (1), use the following method statement:

      * Step 1.	Take the HELP debts (if any) that the person incurred during the first 6 months of the financial year. Group them according to whether the debts are in relation to:

        * (a) units undertaken with a higher education provider that formed part of one particular *course of study with that provider; or

        * (b) units undertaken with a higher education provider that formed part of one particular course of study with another higher education provider; or

        * (c) units that formed part of one particular *bridging course for overseastrained professionals; or

        * (d) units access to which was provided by *Open Universities ; or

        * (e) *OSHELP assistance, the entitlement to which relates to the person's enrolment in a *course of study with one particular higher education provider (see paragraph 1181(1)(c)); or

        * (ea) *SAHELP assistance for *student services and amenities fees imposed on the person by one particular higher education provider; or

        * (f) units undertaken with a *VET provider that formed part of one particular *VET course of study with that provider; or

        * (g) units undertaken with a VET provider that formed part of one particular VET course of study with another VET provider.

           * Note: There will be more than one group of debts under paragraph (a) if the person incurred debts in relation to more than one course of study with a provider. Similarly, there could be more than one group of debts under paragraph (b), (c), (e), (ea), (f) or (g).

      * Step 2.	Work out the total for each group of debts. If the total for a particular group is an amount consisting of a number of whole dollars and a number of cents, the total for that group is taken to be the number of whole dollars. If the total for a group is an amount of less than one dollar, the total for the group is taken to be zero.

      * Step 3.	If there is more than one group of debts for the person, add together the totals for all of the groups.

    * (2) The person incurs the *accumulated HELP debt on 1 June in the financial year.

    * (3) The first financial year for which a person can have an *accumulated HELP debt is the financial year starting on 1 July 2005.

##### 14030  Rounding of amounts

    * (1) If, apart from this section, a person's *accumulated HELP debt would be an amount consisting of a number of whole dollars and a number of cents, disregard the number of cents.

    * (2) If, apart from this section, a person's *accumulated HELP debt would be an amount of less than one dollar, the person's accumulated HELP debt is taken to be zero.

##### 14035  Accumulated HELP debt discharges earlier debts

    * (1) The *accumulated HELP debt that a person incurs on 1 June in a financial year discharges, or discharges the unpaid part of:

     * (a) any *HELP debt that the person incurred during the calendar year immediately preceding that day; and

     * (b) any accumulated HELP debt that the person incurred on the immediately preceding 1 June.

    * (2) Nothing in subsection (1) affects the application of Division 137, Subdivision 140B or section 14025.

##### 14040  Accumulated HELP debt discharged by death

    * (1) Upon the death of a person who has an *accumulated HELP debt, the accumulated HELP debt is taken to be discharged.

    * (2) To avoid doubt, this section does not affect any *compulsory repayment amounts required to be paid in respect of the *accumulated HELP debt, whether or not those amounts were assessed before the person's death.

        * Note: Accumulated HELP debts are not provable in bankruptcy: see subsection 82(3AB) of the _Bankruptcy Act 1966_.

### Part 42--Discharge of indebtedness

#### Division 148--Introduction

##### 1481  What this Part is about

    * A person who owes a debt to the Commonwealth under this Chapter may make voluntary repayments. In some cases these may attract a 5% repayment bonus.

    * The person is required to make repayments, of amounts based on his or her income, if that income is above a particular amount. The Commissioner of Taxation makes assessments of repayment amounts, which are collected in the same way as amounts of income tax.

    * Repayment amounts may be reduced by the HECSHELP benefit. To receive the benefit, a person must satisfy eligibility requirements and apply for it. The Commissioner determines whether a person is eligible for the benefit, and if so, the amount of the benefit.

##### 1485  The HECSHELP Benefit Guidelines

    * The *HECSHELP benefit is also dealt with in the HECSHELP Benefit Guidelines. The provisions of this Part indicate when a particular matter is or may be dealt with in these Guidelines.

        * Note: The HECSHELP Benefit Guidelines are made by the Minister under section 23810.

#### Division 151--How is indebtedness voluntarily discharged?

##### 1511  Voluntary repayments in respect of debts

    * (1) A person may at any time make a payment in respect of a debt that the person owes to the Commonwealth under this Chapter.

    * (2) The payment must be made to the *Commissioner.

##### 1515  Voluntary repayment bonus relating to HELP debts

    * (1) The effect that a payment under section 1511 has on a *HELP debt or an *accumulated HELP debt that a person (the **_debtor_**) owes to the Commonwealth under this Chapter is the effect specified in subsection (2) or (3) of this section if the amount of the payment is:

     * (a) $500 or more; or

     * (b) sufficient to be taken under subsection (2) to pay off the total debt.

    * Total debt paid off

    * (2) The debtor is taken to pay off the total debt if the payment in respect of the debt is equal to, or exceeds, an amount worked out as follows:

        * Example: The total of Andrew's HELP debts and accumulated HELP debt is $2,500. To pay off his debt to the Commonwealth he only needs to repay $2,380 ($2,500 divided by 1.05 is $2,380, rounding down to the nearest dollar).

    * Part of debt paid off

    * (3) If the debtor is not taken to pay off the total debt, the outstanding amount of the debt is to be reduced by an amount worked out as follows:

        * Example: The total of Helen's HELP debts and accumulated HELP debt is $4,500. She makes a voluntary repayment of $1,500. With a 5% bonus, the value of her repayment is $1575. The total amount that she owes to the Commonwealth is reduced to $2,925.

    * Rounding

    * (4) If an amount worked out using the formula in subsection (2) is an amount made up of dollars and cents, round the amount down to the nearest dollar.

    * (5) If an amount worked out using the formula in subsection (3) is an amount made up of dollars and cents, round the amount up to the nearest dollar.

##### 15110  Application of voluntary repayments

    * (1) Any money a person pays under this Division to meet the person's debts to the Commonwealth under this Chapter is to be applied in payment of those debts as the person directs at the time of the payment.

    * (2) If the person has not given any directions, or the directions given do not adequately deal with the matter, any money available is to be applied as follows:

     * (a) first, in discharge or reduction of any *accumulated HELP debt of the person;

     * (b) secondly, in discharge or reduction of:

      * (i) any *HELP debt of the person; or

      * (ii) if there is more than one such debt, those debts in the order in which they were incurred.

##### 15115  Refunding of payments

    * If: 

     * (a) a person pays an amount to the Commonwealth under this Division; and

     * (b) the amount exceeds the sum of:

      * (i) the amount required to discharge the total debt that the person owed to the Commonwealth under this Chapter; and

      * (ii) the total amount of the person's primary tax debts (within the meaning of Part IIB of the _Taxation Administration Act 1953_);

    * the Commonwealth must refund to the person an amount equal to that excess.

        * Note: Interest is payable if the Commonwealth is late in paying refunds: see Part IIIA of the _Taxation (Interest on Overpayments and Early Payments) Act 1983_.

#### Division 154--How is indebtedness compulsorily discharged?

##### Subdivision 154A--Liability to repay amounts

##### 1541  Liability to repay amounts

    * (1) Subject to section 1543, if:

     * (a) a person's *repayment income for an *income year exceeds the *minimum repayment income for the income year; and

     * (b) on 1 June immediately preceding the making of an assessment in respect of the person's income of that income year, the person had an *accumulated HELP debt;

    * the person is liable to pay to the Commonwealth, in accordance with this Division, the amount worked out under section 15420 in reduction of the person's *repayable debt.

    * (2) A person is not liable under this section to pay an amount for an *income year if, under section 8 of the _Medicare Levy Act 1986_:

     * (a) no *Medicare levy is payable by the person on the person's *taxable income for the income year; or

     * (b) the amount of the Medicare levy payable by the person on the person's taxable income for the income year is reduced.

##### 1543  Reduction of liability by HECSHELP benefit

    * If the *Commissioner has determined, in respect of a person, an amount of *HECSHELP benefit under section 15720 for an *income year, the amount that the person is liable to pay under section 1541 for that year is reduced by the amount of the benefit.

        * Note 1: The calculation of a person's compulsory repayment amount under section 1541 remains unaffected. A person's accumulated HELP debt is reduced by compulsory repayment amounts under Division 140. The HECSHELP benefit reduces a person's liability that arises under section 1541, so that the amount that the person will actually pay (if any) will be less than the compulsory repayment amount calculated.

        * Note 2: If a determination is reviewed, a reference to the determination includes a reference to the decision on review, see section 15730.

##### 1545  Repayment income

    * (1) A person's **_repayment income_** for an *income year is an amount equal to the sum of:

     * (a) the person's *taxable income for the income year; and

     * (b) the person's total net investment loss (within the meaning of the _Income Tax Assessment Act 1997_) for the income year; and

     * (c) if the person:

      * (i) is an employee (within the meaning of the _Fringe Benefits Tax Assessment Act 1986_); and

      * (ii) has a reportable fringe benefits total (within the meaning of that Act) for the income year;

     * the reportable fringe benefits total for the income year; and

     * (d) the person's *exempt foreign income for the income year; and

     * (e) the person's reportable superannuation contributions (within the meaning of the _Income Tax Assessment Act 1997_) for the income year.

    * (4) The person's **_exempt foreign income_** is the total amount (if any) by which the person's income that is exempt from tax under section 23AF or 23AG of the _Income Tax Assessment Act 1936_ exceeds the total amount of losses and outgoings that the person incurs in deriving that exempt income.

    * (5) For the purposes of subsection (4), disregard any capital losses and outgoings.

##### 15410  Minimum repayment income

    * The **_minimum repayment income_** for an *income year is:

     * (a) for the 200506 income year--$36,184; or

     * (b) for a later income year--that amount as indexed under section 15425.

##### 15415  Repayable debt for an income year

    * (1) A person's **_repayable debt_** for an *income year is:

     * (a) the person's *accumulated HELP debt referred to in paragraph 1541(1)(b) in relation to that income year; or

     * (b) if one or more amounts:

      * (i) have been paid in reduction of that debt; or

      * (ii) have been assessed under section 15435 to be payable in respect of that debt;

     * the amount (if any) remaining after deducting from that debt the amount, or sum of the amounts, so paid or assessed to be payable.

    * (2) A reference in paragraph (1)(b) to an amount assessed to be payable is, if the amount has been increased or reduced by an amendment of the relevant assessment, a reference to the increased amount or the reduced amount.

##### Subdivision 154B--Amounts payable to the Commonwealth

##### 15420  Amounts payable to the Commonwealth

    * The amount that a person is liable to pay under section 1541, in respect of an *income year, is an amount equal to so much of the person's *repayable debt for the income year as does not exceed the percentage of the person's *repayment income that is applicable under the following table:

##### 15425  Indexation

    * (1) The following amounts for the 200607 *income year, or a later income year:

     * (a) the *minimum repayment income;

     * (b) the amounts referred to in paragraph (a) of the second column of items 1 to 8 of the table in section 15420;

    * are indexed by multiplying the corresponding amounts for the 200506 income year by the amount worked out using the formula: 

    * **	**(2)	**_AWE_**, for an *income year, is the number of dollars in the sum of:

     * (a) the average weekly earnings for all employees (total earnings, seasonally adjusted) for the *reference period in the *quarter ending on 31 December immediately before the income year, as published by the *Australian Statistician; and

     * (b) the average weekly earnings for all employees for the reference period in the quarter ending on 30 June that is immediately before the quarter referred to in paragraph (a), as published by the Australian Statistician.

    * (3) The **_reference period_** in a particular *quarter in a year is the period described by the *Australian Statistician as the pay period ending on or before a specified day that is the third Friday of the middle month of that quarter.

    * (4) If an amount worked out under this section is an amount made up of dollars and cents, round the amount down to the nearest dollar.

##### 15430  Publishing indexed amounts

    * The Minister must cause to be published in the _Gazette_, before the start of the 200607 *income year or a later income year:

     * (a) the *minimum repayment income; and

     * (b) the amounts referred to in paragraph (b) of the second column of items 1 to 8 of the table in section 15420;

    * for that income year.

##### Subdivision 154C--Assessments

##### 15435  Commissioner may make assessments

    * The *Commissioner may, from any information in the Commissioner's possession, whether from a *return or otherwise, make an assessment of:

     * (a) the person's *accumulated HELP debt on 1 June immediately before the making of the assessment; and

     * (b) the amount required to be paid in respect of that debt under section 1541.

        * Note: The amount that the person will actually pay (if any) will be less than the amount mentioned in paragraph (b) if the person receives the HECSHELP benefit.

##### 15440  Notification of notices of assessment of tax

    * (1) If:

     * (a) the *Commissioner is required to serve on a person a notice of assessment in respect of the person's income of an *income year under section 174 of the _Income Tax Assessment Act 1936_; and

     * (b) the Commissioner has made, in respect of the person, an assessment under section 15435 of this Act of the amounts referred to in that section; and

     * (c) notice of the assessment under that section has not been served on the person;

    * notice of the assessment under that section may be served by specifying the amounts concerned in the notice referred to in paragraph (a).

    * (2) If the *Commissioner has determined, in respect of the person, an amount of *HECSHELP benefit under section 15720 for the *income year, the notice of assessment for that year may also refer to the amount of the benefit.

        * Note: If a determination is reviewed, a reference to the determination includes a reference to the decision on review, see section 15730.

##### 15445  Commissioner may defer making assessments

    * (1) A person may apply in the *approved form to the *Commissioner for deferral of the making of an assessment in respect of the person under section 15435.

    * (2) The application must specify:

     * (a) the *income year for which the deferral is being sought; and

     * (b) the reasons for seeking the deferral.

    * (3) The *income year specified in the application must be:

     * (a) the income year in which the person makes the application; or

     * (b) the immediately preceding income year; or

     * (c) the immediately succeeding income year.

    * (4) The *Commissioner may, on application by a person under this section, defer making an assessment in respect of the person under section 15435 if the Commissioner is of the opinion that:

     * (a) if the assessment were made, payment of the assessed amount would cause serious hardship to the person; or

     * (b) there are other special reasons that make it fair and reasonable to defer making the assessment.

    * (5) The *Commissioner may defer making the assessment for any period that he or she thinks appropriate.

    * (6) The *Commissioner must, as soon as practicable after an application is made under this section:

     * (a) consider the matter to which the application relates; and

     * (b) notify the applicant of the Commissioner's decision on the application.

        * Note: Deferrals of making assessments, or refusals of applications, are reviewable under Part 57.

##### 15450  Commissioner may amend assessments

    * (1) A person may apply in the *approved form to the *Commissioner for an amendment of an assessment made in respect of the person under section 15435 so that:

     * (a) the amount payable under the assessment is reduced; or

     * (b) no amount is payable under the assessment.

    * (2) The application:

     * (a) must be made within 2 years after the day on which the *Commissioner gives notice of the assessment to the person; or

     * (b) must specify the reasons justifying a later application.

    * (3) The *Commissioner may, on application by a person under this section, amend an assessment made in respect of the person under section 15435 so that:

     * (a) the amount payable under the assessment is reduced; or

    * (1) A *VET provider must, on the *Secretary's behalf, recredit a person's *FEEHELP balance with an amount equal to the amounts of *VET FEEHELP assistance that the person received for a *VET unit of study if:

     * (a) the person has been enrolled in the unit with the provider; and

     * (b) the person has not completed the requirements for the unit during the period during which the person undertook, or was to undertake, the unit because the provider ceased to provide the unit as a result of ceasing to provide the course of which the unit formed part; and

     * (c) the *VET tuition assurance requirements applied to the provider at the time the provider ceased to provide the unit; and

     * (d) the person chose the option designated under the VET tuition assurance requirements as VET tuition fee repayment in relation to the unit.

     * (a) the student's *VET tuition fee for the unit; and

     * (b) the sum of any *upfront VET payments made in relation to the unit.

        * Note: A lesser amount may be payable because of clause 54.

##### 53  Upfront payments

    * (1) An **_upfront VET payment_**, in relation to a *VET unit of study for which a student is liable to pay a *VET tuition fee, is a payment of all or part of the student's VET tuition fee for the unit, other than a payment of *VET FEEHELP assistance under this Part.

    * (2) The payment must be made on or before the *census date for the unit.

##### 54  Amounts of VET FEEHELP assistance and FEEHELP assistance must not exceed the FEEHELP balance

    * Amount of VET FEEHELP assistance for one unit

    * (1) The amount of *VET FEEHELP assistance to which a student is entitled for a *VET unit of study is an amount equal to the student's *FEEHELP balance on the *census date for the unit if:

     * (a) there is no other:

      * (i) VET unit of study, with the same census date, for which the student is entitled to VET FEEHELP assistance; or

      * (ii) unit of study, with the same census date, for which the student is entitled to *FEEHELP assistance; and

     * (b) the amount of VET FEEHELP assistance to which the student would be entitled under clause 52 for the unit would exceed that FEEHELP balance.

    * Amount of VET FEEHELP assistance for more than one unit

    * (2) If the sum of:

     * (a) the amount of *VET FEEHELP assistance to which a student would be entitled under clause 52 for a *VET unit of study; and

     * (b) any other amounts of:

      * (i) VET FEEHELP assistance to which the student would be entitled under that clause for other units that have the same *census date as that unit; and

      * (ii) *FEEHELP assistance to which the student would be entitled under clause 52 for other units that have the same census date as that unit;

    * would exceed the student's *FEEHELP balance on the census date for the unit, then, despite subclause (1) of this clause, the total amount of VET FEEHELP assistance and FEEHELP assistance to which the student is entitled for all of those units is an amount equal to that FEEHELP balance.

        * Example: Kath has a FEEHELP balance of $2,000, and is enrolled in 4 units with the same census date. Kath's VET tuition fee for each unit is $600. The total amount of VET FEEHELP assistance to which Kath is entitled for the units is $2,000, even though the total amount of her VET tuition fees for the units is $2,400.

    * (3) If the student has enrolled in the units with more than one *VET provider or higher education provider, the student must notify each provider of the proportion of the total amount of *VET FEEHELP assistance or *FEEHELP assistance that is to be payable in relation to the units in which the student has enrolled with that provider.

#### Division 9--How are amounts of VET FEEHELP assistance paid?

  * Note: Division 11 also deals with payments by the Commonwealth under this Schedule.

     * (b) pay the amount lent to the provider in discharge of the student's liability to pay his or her *VET tuition fee for the unit.

        * Note: Amounts of assistance under this Part may form part of a person's HELP debts that the Commonwealth recovers under Chapter 4.

##### 56  Effect of FEEHELP balance being recredited

    * (1) If, under subclause 46(2) or 47(1), or clause 51, a person's *FEEHELP balance is recredited with an amount relating to *VET FEEHELP assistance for a *VET unit of study, the provider must pay to the Commonwealth an amount equal to the amount of VET FEEHELP assistance to which the person was entitled for the unit.

        * Note: The provider must repay the amount under subclause (1) even if the person's FEEHELP balance is not increased by an amount equal to the amount recredited.

    * (2) Subclause (1) does not apply to the provider if:

     * (a) the person's *FEEHELP balance was recredited under subclause 46(2) (main case of recrediting a person's FEEHELP balance); and

     * (b) the person enrolled in the unit in circumstances that make it a replacement unit within the meaning of the *VET tuition assurance requirements.

    * (3) The *VET Guidelines may, in setting out the *VET tuition assurance requirements, specify, in relation to the recrediting of a person's *FEEHELP balance in circumstances to which subclause (2) applies:

     * (a) the amount (if any) that is to be paid to the Commonwealth; and

     * (b) the person (if any) who is to pay the amounts.
