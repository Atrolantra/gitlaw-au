    * (3) This Act applies in relation to such a judgment, settlement or reimbursement arrangement even if it is made in respect of an injury that occurred before that day.

    * (4) In its application in respect of an injury that occurred before that day, this Act is capable of applying in relation to a particular payment of an eligible benefit whether the payment was made before, on or after that day.

##### 5  Charge on compensation in respect of reimbursements for professional services

    * (1) This section applies if:

     * (a) a reimbursement arrangement has been made in respect of an injury to a compensable person; and

    * (2) If:

     * (a) medicare benefit has been paid in respect of a professional service rendered to the person; and

     * (b) under the reimbursement arrangement, the person is entitled to reimbursement of the whole or any part of the amount payable for the service;
