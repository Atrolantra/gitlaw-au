   * **_Justice_** means a Justice of the High Court.

   * **_retirement_**, in relation to a Justice, means ceasing to be a Justice otherwise than by death.

##### 4  Payment on retirement or death of Justice

   * (1) On:

    * (a) the retirement of a Justice after having completed at least 10 years' service as a Justice; or

    * (b) the death of a Justice, whether or not he or she has completed 10 years' service as a Justice;

   * an amount calculated in accordance with subsection (2) is payable in accordance with this Act.

   * (2) The amount payable under subsection (1) in respect of a Justice is an amount equal to the judicial salary of the Justice for:

    * (a) a period of 52 weeks; or

    * (b) a period of weeks calculated at the rate of 5.2 weeks for each completed year of the Justice's qualifying service;

   * whichever is the lesser period.

   * (2A) Where:

    * (a) a Justice (not being a Justice to whom subsection (1) applies) is to cease to hold office as a Justice upon attaining a particular age, and the Justice ceases to be a Justice upon attaining that age; and

    * (b) at the time of the Justice's so ceasing, the period of his or her service as a Justice was not less than 6 years;

   * an amount calculated in accordance with subsection (2C) is payable in accordance with this Act.

   * (2B) Where:

    * (a) a Justice (not being a Justice to whom subsection (1) applies) retires; and

    * (b) the Attorney-General certifies under section 6 of the _Judges' Pensions Act 1968_ that the retirement is due to permanent disability or infirmity;

   * an amount calculated in accordance with subsection (2C) is payable in accordance with this Act.

   * (2C) The amount payable under subsection (2A) or (2B) in respect of a Justice is an amount equal to the judicial salary of the Justice for a period of weeks calculated at the rate of 5.2 weeks for each completed year of the Justice's qualifying service.

   * (3) In this section:

   * **_qualifying service_**, in relation to a Justice, means the period of his or her service as a Justice, other than any period of such service in respect of which the Justice has taken long leave or has been paid in lieu of such leave.

   * **_service as a Justice_**, in relation to a Justice, means the period that is to be regarded, in relation to the Justice, as service as a Judge for the purposes of section 6 of the _Judges' Pensions Act 1968_.

##### 5  Recipient of payment under section 4

   * (1) An amount payable under section 4 on the retirement of a Justice is payable to the Justice.

   * (2) An amount payable under section 4 on the death of a Justice is payable to:

    * (a) where the Justice leaves a surviving spouse or de facto partner-that surviving spouse or de facto partner;

    * (b) where the Justice does not leave a surviving spouse or de facto partner but leaves a dependant or dependants-that dependant or those dependants; or

    * (c) in any other case-the legal personal representative of the Justice.

   * (2A) If an amount is payable under paragraph (2)(a) and the Justice leaves more than one surviving spouse or de facto partner, the Attorney-General may give a direction as to the distribution of the amount between or among them.

   * (3) Where an amount is payable under paragraph (2)(b) to the dependants of a Justice, the Attorney-General may give a direction as to the distribution of the amount between or among those dependants.

   * (4) Where an amount is payable under this section to a person who is under a legal disability, the Attorney-General may, instead of authorizing payment of the amount to the person, authorize payment of the amount to such trustee or trustees as the Attorney-General appoints to be held by that trustee or those trustees upon such trusts for the benefit of the person as the Attorney-General directs.

   * (5) In this section:

   * **_surviving spouse or de facto partner_** of a Justice who has died means a person who was the spouse or de facto partner (within the meaning of the _Acts Interpretation Act 1901_) of the Justice immediately before he or she died.
