      * (a) a person is not a member of a couple; and

      * (b) the person has made a claim for newstart allowance, widow allowance, mature age allowance under Part 2.12B, youth allowance, special benefit, parenting payment, disability support pension, sickness allowance, carer payment or austudy payment; and

    * the person's **_seasonal work preclusion period_** in relation to the claim is the period consisting of the number of weeks worked out under subsection (5) that starts on the day on which the claim was lodged.

    * (4) If:

      * (a) a person is a member of a couple; and

      * (b) the person has made a claim for newstart allowance, mature age allowance under Part 2.12B, partner allowance, parenting payment, youth allowance, special benefit, disability support pension, sickness allowance, carer payment or austudy payment; and

      * (c) the person, or the person's partner, or both, were engaged in seasonal work at any time during the 6 months immediately before the day on which the person lodged the claim;

    * the person's **_seasonal work preclusion period_** in relation to the claim is the period consisting of the number of weeks worked out under subsection (6), (7) or (8) that starts on the day on which the claim was lodged.

    * (5) If the person is not a member of a couple, the number of weeks in the person's seasonal work preclusion period is worked out as follows:

Method statement

       * Step 1.	Identify each period of continuous seasonal work by the person that ended during the 6 months immediately before the day on which the claim was lodged. If the person has performed seasonal work during 2 periods that are less than 14 days apart, the periods of work and the intervening period are taken to be one continuous period during which the person has performed seasonal work.

       * Step 2.	If a period identified in Step 1 has already been taken into account when working out a seasonal work preclusion period in relation to a previous claim by the person (whether for the same or a different allowance or payment), disregard the period. Each remaining period is called a **_relevant period of seasonal work_**.

       * Step 3.	Work out the amount of seasonal work income earned by the person during each of the person's relevant periods of seasonal work, disregarding any income by way of a lump sum that was earned during that period but was not paid to the person before the day on which the claim was lodged.

       * Step 4.	Add together the amounts worked out in Step 3. The result is called the person's **_seasonal work earnings_**.

       * Step 5.	Divide the person's seasonal work earnings by the amount of the relevant AWOTE for the calendar year in which the claim was lodged. The result is called the person's **_AWOTE weeks_** and represents the number of weeks (including any part of a week) that a person paid at a rate equal to the relevant AWOTE for that calendar year would have to work to earn an amount equal to the person's seasonal work earnings.

       * Step 6.	Work out the number of weeks in the person's relevant periods of seasonal work by dividing the total number of days included in those periods by 7. The result (including any part of a week) is called the person's **_seasonal work weeks_**.

       * Step 6A.	If there is a period between one relevant period of seasonal work and another, or between a relevant period of seasonal work and the day on which the claim was lodged, work out the number of weeks in the period (the **_intervening period_**). This is done by dividing the total number of days in the intervening period by 7.

       * Step 6B.	If there is more than one intervening period, add together the number of weeks worked out for each intervening period. The result (including any part of a week) is called the person's**_ intervening weeks_**.

       * Step 6C.	Add together the number of seasonal work weeks worked out under Step 6 and the number of intervening weeks (if any) worked out under Step 6B. The result (including any part of a week) is called the person's **_selfsupported weeks_**.

       * Step 7.	Subtract the person's selfsupported weeks from the person's AWOTE weeks. The result (rounded down, if necessary, to the nearest whole number) is the **_number of weeks in the person's seasonal work preclusion period_**. If the result is a negative number, the number of weeks in the period is taken to be nil.

         * Note 1: For **_relevant AWOTE _**see subsection (1).

         * Note 2: For **_seasonal work _**see subsection (1).

         * Note 3: For **_seasonal work income_** see subsection (1).

    * (6) If:

      * (a) the person is a member of a couple; and

      * (b) the person was engaged in seasonal work at any time during the 6 months immediately before the day on which the person lodged the claim (the **_relevant period_**); and

      * (c) the person's partner was not engaged in seasonal work at any time during the relevant period;

    * the number of weeks in the person's seasonal work preclusion period is worked out as follows:

Method statement

       * Step 1.	Identify each period of continuous seasonal work by the person that ended during the 6 months immediately before the day on which the claim was lodged. If the person has performed seasonal work during 2 periods that are less than 14 days apart, the periods of work and the intervening period are taken to be one continuous period during which the person has performed seasonal work.

       * Step 2.	If a period identified in Step 1 has already been taken into account when working out a seasonal work preclusion period in relation to a previous claim by the person (whether for the same or a different allowance or payment), disregard the period. Each remaining period is called a **_relevant period of seasonal work_**.

       * Step 3.	Work out the amount of seasonal work income earned by the person during each of the person's relevant periods of seasonal work, disregarding any income by way of a lump sum that was earned during that period but was not paid to the person before the day on which the claim was lodged.

       * Step 4.	Add together the amounts worked out in Step 3. The result is called the person's **_seasonal work earnings_**.

       * Step 5.	Work out the total amount of income from personal exertion earned by the person's partner during the person's relevant periods of seasonal work. Add the amount obtained to the person's seasonal work earnings. The result is called the **_couple's combined earnings_**.

       * Step 6.	Divide the couple's combined earnings by twice the amount of the relevant AWOTE for the calendar year in which the claim was lodged. The result is called the couple's **_AWOTE weeks_** and represents the number of weeks (including any part of a week) that 2 persons, each paid at a rate equal to the relevant AWOTE for that calendar year, would have to work to earn together an amount equal to the couple's combined earnings.

       * Step 7.	Work out the number of weeks in the person's relevant periods of seasonal work by dividing the total number of days included in those periods by 7. The result (including any part of a week) is called the person's **_seasonal work weeks_**.

       * Step 7A.	If there is a period between one relevant period of seasonal work and another, or between a relevant period of seasonal work and the day on which the claim was lodged, work out the number of weeks in the period (the **_intervening period_**). This is done by dividing the total number of days in the intervening period by 7.

       * Step 7B.	If there is more than one intervening period, add together the number of weeks worked out for each intervening period. The result (including any part of a week) is called the person's **_intervening weeks_**.

       * Step 7C.	Add together the number of seasonal work weeks worked out under Step 7 and the number of intervening weeks (if any) worked out under Step 7B. The result (including any part of a week) is called the person's **_selfsupported weeks_**.

       * Step 8.	Subtract the person's selfsupported weeks from the couple's AWOTE weeks. The result (rounded down, if necessary, to the nearest whole number) is the **_number of weeks in the person's seasonal work preclusion period_**. If the result is a negative number, the number of weeks in the period is taken to be nil.

         * Note 1: For **_relevant AWOTE _**see subsection (1).

         * Note 2: For **_seasonal work _**see subsection (1).

         * Note 3: For **_seasonal work income_** see subsection (1).

    * (7) If:

      * (a) the person is a member of a couple; and

      * (b) the person was not engaged in seasonal work at any time during the 6 months immediately before the day on which the person lodged the claim (the **_relevant period_**); and

      * (c) the person's partner was engaged in seasonal work at any time during the relevant period;

    * the number of weeks in the person's seasonal work preclusion period is worked out as follows:

Method statement

       * Step 1.	Identify each period of continuous seasonal work by the partner that ended during the 6 months immediately before the day on which the claim was lodged. If the partner has performed seasonal work during 2 periods that are less than 14 days apart, the periods of work and the intervening period are taken to be one continuous period during which the partner has performed seasonal work.

       * Step 2.	If a period identified in Step 1 has already been taken into account when working out a seasonal work preclusion period in relation to a previous claim by the person (whether for the same or a different allowance or payment), disregard the period. Each remaining period is called a **_relevant period of seasonal work_**.

       * Step 3.	Work out the total amount of income from personal exertion earned by the person during the partner's relevant periods of seasonal work. The result is called the **_person's earnings_**.

       * Step 4.	Work out the amount of seasonal work income earned by the partner during each of the partner's relevant periods of seasonal work, disregarding any income by way of a lump sum that was earned during that period but was not paid to the partner before the day on which the claim was lodged.

       * Step 5.	Add together the amounts worked out in Step 4. The result is called the partner's **_seasonal work earnings_**.

       * Step 6.	Add the partner's seasonal work earnings and the person's earnings. The result is called the **_couple's combined earnings_**.

       * Step 7.	Divide the couple's combined earnings by twice the amount of the relevant AWOTE for the calendar year in which the claim was lodged. The result is called the couple's **_AWOTE weeks_** and represents the number of weeks (including any part of a week) that 2 persons, each paid at a rate equal to the relevant AWOTE for that calendar year, would have to work to earn together an amount equal to the couple's combined earnings.

       * Step 8.	Work out the number of weeks in the partner's relevant periods of seasonal work by dividing the total number of days included in those periods by 7. The result (including any part of a week) is called the partner's **_seasonal work weeks_**.

       * Step 8A.	If there is a period between one relevant period of seasonal work and another, or between a relevant period of seasonal work and the day on which the claim was lodged, work out the number of weeks in the period (the **_intervening period_**). This is done by dividing the total number of days in the intervening period by 7.

       * Step 8B.	If there is more than one intervening period, add together the number of weeks worked out for each intervening period. The result (including any part of a week) is called the partner's **_intervening weeks_**.

       * Step 8C.	Add together the number of seasonal work weeks worked out under Step 8 and the number of intervening weeks (if any) worked out under Step 8B. The result (including any part of a week) is called the partner's **_selfsupported weeks_**.

       * Step 9.	Subtract the partner's selfsupported weeks from the couple's AWOTE weeks. The result (rounded down, if necessary, to the nearest whole number) is the **_number of weeks in the person's seasonal work preclusion period_**. If the result is a negative number, the number of weeks in the period is taken to be nil.

         * Note 1: For **_relevant AWOTE _**see subsection (1).

         * Note 2: For **_seasonal work _**see subsection (1).

         * Note 3: For **_seasonal work income_** see subsection (1).

    * (8) If:

      * (a) the person is a member of a couple; and

      * (b) both the person and the person's partner have engaged in seasonal work during the 6 months immediately before the day on which the claim was lodged;

    * the number of weeks in the person's seasonal work preclusion period is worked out as follows:

Method statement

       * Step 1.	Work out what would be the number of weeks in the person's seasonal work preclusion period if subsection (6) applied to the person.

       * Step 2.	Work out what would be the number of weeks in the person's seasonal work preclusion period if subsection (7) applied to the person.

       * Step 3.	Compare the number of weeks in each period. The **_number of weeks in the person's seasonal work preclusion period _**is equal to the number of weeks in the longer of the 2 periods.

    * Subject to a seasonal work preclusion period

    * (11) If a person's seasonal work preclusion period in relation to a claim consists of a number of weeks that is greater than nil, then, except as otherwise provided under this Act, the person is **_subject to that period_** for the purposes of this Act.

         * EXAMPLE OF APPLICATION OF SUBSECTION (5)

         * _Facts:_

     * _John receives an income support payment for 48 weeks. He is then employed for 14 weeks. After the 14 weeks he again begins to receive an income support payment. How does his break in payments affect the calculation of his continuous period of receipt of income support payments?

         * _Application:_

     * _At the end of the first 4 weeks of John's employment he may be taken, under subsection 38B(3), to have received income support payments for a continuous period of 12 months because no longer than 6 weeks have elapsed since he actually received such a payment.

     * Therefore, as John may be taken to have accrued 12 months continuous receipt of income support payments, he may have a period, under subsection 38B(4), of not longer than 13 weeks without income support payments and still be taken to be in continuous receipt.

     * However, under subsection 38B(5), the period of not longer than 13 weeks allowed under subsection 38B(4) must include the period of 4 weeks that occurred immediately before, as well as the 10 weeks immediately after, John was taken to have accrued 12 months duration.

     * As his total period in which he did not receive income support payments wa4 weeks, it exceeds the 13 weeks allowed under subsection 38B(4). His continuous period in receipt of income support ceased, under subsection 38B(2), on the last day he received payment before he started employment.

     * A new period of continuous receipt of income support payments will begin when John resumes income support payments after hi4 week break.

    * (6) For the purposes of this section, a person who was receiving an income support payment is taken to have continued to receive the payment in respect of a period if:

      * (a) for the duration of the period, the person remained qualified to receive the income support payment by the operation of the exercise of the discretion under:

       * (i) section 516 of this Act as in force at a time before 20 September 1996; or

       * (ii) section 595 of this Act (disregard a period of employment);

      * but the person's rate of payment was reduced to nil because of the operation of:

       * (iii) section 1067G, 1067L or 1068 of this Act; or

      * (b) the period was a compliance penalty period that applied to the person in respect of the income support payment; or

      * (c) subsection 547AA(1), 615(1) or 771HF(1) applied to the person in respect of the income support payment for the duration of the period.

         * Note: For **_income support payment _**see subsection 23(1).

      * (b) provide a method for rating the care needs of the child; and

      * (c) provide a method for giving a qualifying rating to a person (the **_carer_**) who is caring for the child that takes into account:

       * (i) the care provided for the child by the carer; and

       * (ii) the assessment completed by the treating health professional.

    * (2) If a carer who is caring for a child also cares for one or more other persons (whether or not aged under 16), the Disability Care Load Assessment (Child) Determination may provide a method for giving a qualifying rating to the carer that takes into account:

      * (a) both:

       * (i) the care provided for the child by the carer; and

LUMP SUM CALCULATOR

    * This is how to work out the amount of the lump sum: 

Method statement

       * Step 1.	Work out the amount that would have been payable to the person on the person's payday immediately before the first available bereavement adjustment payday if:

         * (a) the person's partner had not died; and

         * (b) where immediately before the partner's death the couple were an illness separated couple or a respite care couple--they were not such a couple.

       * Step 2.	Work out the amount that would have been payable to the person's partner on the partner's payday or service payday immediately before the first available bereavement adjustment payday if:

         * (a) the partner had not died; and

         * (b) where immediately before the partner's death the couple were an illness separated couple or a respite care couple--they were not such a couple.

       * Step 3.	Add the results of Step 1 and Step 2: the result is called the **_combined rate_**.

       * Step 4.	Work out the amount that, but for section 85, would have been payable to the person on the person's payday immediately before the first available bereavement adjustment payday: the result is called the **_person's individual rate_**.

       * Step 5.	Take the person's individual rate away from the combined rate: the result is called the **_partner's instalment component_**.

       * Step 6.	Work out the number of paydays of the partner in the bereavement lump sum period.

       * Step 7.	Multiply the partner's instalment component by the number obtained in Step 6: the result is the amount of the lump sum payable to the person under this section.

##### 85  Adjustment of person's age pension rate

    * If: 

      * (a) a person is qualified for payments under this Subdivision; and

      * (b) the person does not elect under subsection 82(2) not to receive payments under this Subdivision;

    * the rate of the person's age pension during the bereavement period is worked out as follows:

      * (c) during the bereavement rate continuation period, the rate of age pension payable to the person is the rate at which the pension would have been payable to the person if:

       * (i) the person's partner had not died; and

       * (ii) where immediately before the partner's death the couple were an illness separated couple or a respite care couple--they were not such a couple;

      * (d) during the bereavement lump sum period (if any), the rate at which age pension is payable to the person is the rate at which the age pension would be payable to the person apart from this Subdivision.

##### 86  Effect of death of person entitled to payments under this Subdivision

    * If: 

      * (a) a person is qualified for payments under this Subdivision in relation to the death of the person's partner; and

      * (b) the person dies within the bereavement period; and

      * (c) the Secretary does not become aware of the death of the person's partner before the person dies;

    * there is payable, to such person as the Secretary thinks appropriate, as a lump sum, an amount worked out using the lump sum calculator at the end of this section.

LUMP SUM CALCULATOR

    * This is how to work out the amount of the lump sum: 

Method statement

       * Step 1_._	Work out the amount that would have been payable to the person on the person's payday immediately after the day on which the person died if:

         * (a) neither the person nor the person's partner had died; and

         * (b) where immediately before the partner's death the couple were an illness separated couple or a respite care couple--they were not such a couple.

         * (a) neither the person nor the partner had died; and

         * (b) where immediately before the partner's death the couple were an illness separated couple or a respite care couple--they were not such a couple.

       * Step 3.	Add the results of Step 1 and Step 2: the result is called the **_combined rate_**.

       * Step 4.	Work out the amount that, but for section 85, would have been payable to the person on the person's payday immediately after the day on which the person died if the person had not died: the result is called the **_person's individual rate_**.

       * Step 5.	Take the person's individual rate away from the combined rate: the result is called the **_partner's instalment component_**.

       * Step 6.	Work out the number of paydays of the partner in the period that commences on the day on which the person dies and ends on the day on which the bereavement period ends.

       * Step 7.	Multiply the partner's instalment component by the number obtained in Step 6: the result is the amount of the lump sum payable under this section.

LUMP SUM CALCULATOR

    * This is how to work out the amount of the lump sum: 

Method statement

       * Step 1.	Work out the amount that would have been payable to the person on the partner's payday immediately before the first available bereavement adjustment payday if:

         * (a) the person's partner had not died; and

         * (b) where immediately before the partner's death the couple were an illness separated couple or a respite care couple--they were not such a couple.

       * Step 2.	Work out the amount that would have been payable to the person's partner on the partner's payday or service payday immediately before the first available bereavement adjustment payday if:

         * (a) the partner had not died; and

         * (b) where immediately before the partner's death the couple were an illness separated couple or a respite care couple--they were not such a couple.

       * Step 3.	Add the results of Step 1 and Step 2: the result is called the **_combined rate_**.

       * Step 4.	Work out the amount that, but for section 146J, would have been payable to the person on the person's payday immediately before the first available bereavement adjustment payday: the result is called the **_person's individual rate_**.

       * Step 5.	Take the person's individual rate away from the combined rate: the result is called the **_partner's instalment component_**.

       * Step 6.	Work out the number of paydays of the partner in the bereavement lump sum period.

       * Step 7.	Multiply the partner's instalment component by the number obtained in Step 6: the result is the amount of the lump sum payable to the person under this section.

##### 146J  Adjustment of person's disability support pension rate

    * If: 

      * (a) a person is qualified for payments under this Subdivision; and

      * (b) the person does not elect under subsection 146F(2) not to receive payments under this Subdivision;

    * the rate of the person's disability support pension during the bereavement period is worked out as follows:

      * (c) during the bereavement rate continuation period, the rate of disability support pension payable to the person is the rate at which the pension would have been payable to the person if:

       * (i) the person's partner had not died; and

       * (ii) where immediately before the partner's death the couple were an illness separated couple or a respite care couple--they were not such a couple;

      * (d) during the bereavement lump sum period (if any), the rate at which disability support pension is payable to the person is the rate at which the disability support pension would be payable to the person apart from this Subdivision.

      * (c) the Secretary does not become aware of the death of the person's partner before the person dies;

    * there is payable, to such person as the Secretary thinks appropriate, as a lump sum, an amount worked out using the lump sum calculator at the end of this section.

LUMP SUM CALCULATOR

    * This is how to work out the amount of the lump sum: 

Method statement

       * Step 1.	Work out the amount that would have been payable to the person on the person's payday immediately after the day on which the person died if:

         * (a) neither the person nor the person's partner had died; and

         * (b) where immediately before the partner's death the couple were an illness separated couple or a respite care couple--they were not such a couple.

       * Step 2.	Work out the amount that would have been payable to the partner on the partner's payday or service payday immediately after the day on which the person died if:

         * (a) neither the person nor the partner had died; and

         * (b) where immediately before the partner's death the couple were an illness separated couple or a respite care couple--they were not such a couple.

       * Step 3.	Add the results of Step 1 and Step 2: the result is called the **_combined rate_**.

       * Step 4.	Work out the amount that, but for section 97 of the Administration Act, would have been payable to the person on the person's payday immediately after the day on which the person died if the person had not died: the result is called the **_person's individual rate_**.

       * Step 5.	Take the person's individual rate away from the combined rate: the result is called the **_partner's instalment component_**.

       * Step 6.	Work out the number of paydays of the partner in the period that commences on the day on which the person dies and ends on the day on which the bereavement period ends.

       * Step 7.	Multiply the partner's instalment component by the number obtained in Step 6: the result is the amount of the lump sum payable under this section.

         * (a) the woman's partner had not died; and

         * (b) where immediately before the partner's death the couple were an illness separated couple or a respite care couple--they were not such a couple.

       * Step 2.	Work out the amount that would have been payable to the woman's partner on the first day that would have been a payday of the partner on or after the first available bereavement adjustment payday if:

         * (a) the partner had not died; and

         * (b) where immediately before the partner's death the couple were an illness separated couple or a respite care couple--they were not such a couple.

       * Step 3.	Add the results of Step 1 and Step 2: the result is called the **_combined pensioner couple rate_**.

       * Step 4.	Work out the amount of widow B pension that would have been payable to the woman on her payday immediately before the first available bereavement adjustment payday if a widow B pension had been payable to the woman on that payday: the result is called the **_woman's individual rate_**.

       * Step 5.	Take the woman's individual rate away from the combined pensioner couple rate: the result is called the **_partner's instalment component_**.

       * Step 6.	Work out the number of the partner's paydays in the bereavement lump sum period.

       * Step 7.	Multiply the partner's instalment component by the number obtained in Step 6: the result is the amount of the lump sum payable to the woman under this section.

         * (b) where immediately before the partner's death the couple were an illness separated couple or a respite care couple--they were not such a couple.

       * Step 3.	Add the results of Step 1 and Step 2: the result is called the **_combined pensioner couple rate_**.

       * Step 4.	Work out the amount that, but for sections 186 and 187, would have been payable to the woman on the woman's payday immediately after the day on which the woman died if the woman had not died: the result is called the **_woman's individual rate_**.

       * (i) is specified in a notice under section 70 of the Administration Act; and

       * (ii) is described by the notice as a notifiable event.

          * Example: Suppose 4 April 1996 is a carer payment payday. It falls in the calendar year 1 January to 31 December 1996, so the base tax year for that payday is the tax year that ended on 30 June 1995 (i.e. the year of income beginning on 1 July 1994).

LUMP SUM CALCULATOR

    * This is how to work out the amount of the lump sum: 

Method statement

       * Step 1.	Work out the amount that would have been payable to the person on the person's payday immediately before the first available bereavement adjustment payday if:

         * (a) the person's partner had not died; and

         * (b) where immediately before the partner's death the couple were an illness separated couple or a respite care couple--they were not such a couple.

         * (a) the partner had not died; and

         * (b) where immediately before the partner's death the couple were an illness separated couple or a respite care couple--they were not such a couple.

       * Step 3.	Add the results of Step 1 and Step 2: the result is called the **_combined rate_**.

       * Step 4.	Work out the amount that, but for section 240, would have been payable to the person on the person's payday immediately before the first available bereavement adjustment payday: the result is called the **_person's individual rate_**.

       * Step 5.	Take the person's individual rate away from the combined rate: the result is called the **_partner's instalment component_**.

       * Step 6.	Work out the number of the partner's paydays in the bereavement lump sum period.

       * Step 7.	Multiply the partner's instalment component by the number obtained in Step 6: the result is the amount of the lump sum payable to the person under this section.

       * (i) the person's partner had not died; and

       * (ii) where immediately before the partner's death the couple were an illness separated couple or a respite care couple--they were not such a couple;

      * (d) during the bereavement lump sum period (if any), the rate at which carer payment is payable to the person is the rate at which the carer payment would be payable to the person apart from this Subdivision.

    * there is payable, to such person as the Secretary thinks appropriate, as a lump sum, an amount worked out using the lump sum calculator at the end of this section.

LUMP SUM CALCULATOR

    * This is how to work out the amount of the lump sum: 

Method statement

       * Step 1.	Work out the amount that would have been payable to the person on the person's payday immediately after the day on which the person died if:

         * (a) neither the person nor the person's partner had died; and

         * (b) where immediately before the partner's death the couple were an illness separated couple or a respite care couple--they were not such a couple.

         * (a) neither the person nor the partner had died; and

         * (b) where immediately before the partner's death the couple were an illness separated couple or a respite care couple--they were not such a couple.

       * Step 3.	Add the results of Step 1 and Step 2: the result is called the **_combined rate_**.

       * Step 4.	Work out the amount that, but for section 240, would have been payable to the person on the person's payday immediately after the day on which the person died if the person had not died: the result is called the **_person's individual rate_**.

       * Step 5.	Take the person's individual rate away from the combined rate: the result is called the **_partner's instalment component_**.

       * Step 6.	Work out the number of partner's paydays in the period that commences on the day on which the person dies and ends on the day on which the bereavement period ends.

       * Step 7.	Multiply the partner's instalment component by the number obtained in Step 6: the result is the amount of the lump sum payable under this section.

Lump Sum Calculator

    * This is how to work out the amount of the lump sum: 

Method statement

       * Step 1.	Work out the amount that would have been payable to the surviving partner on the surviving partner's payday immediately before the first available bereavement adjustment payday if:

         * (a) the deceased partner had not died; and

         * (b) if, immediately before the partner's death, the couple were an illness separated couple or a respite care couple--they were not such a couple.

             * Note: For **_illness separated couple_** and **_respite care couple_** see subsections 4(7) and (8).

       * Step 2.	Work out the amount that would have been payable to the deceased partner on the deceased partner's payday immediately before the first available bereavement adjustment payday if:

         * (a) the deceased partner had not died; and

         * (b) if, immediately before the partner's death, the couple were an illness separated couple or a respite care couple--they were not such a couple.

             * Note: For **_illness separated couple_** and **_respite care couple_** see subsections 4(7) and (8).

       * Step 3.	Add the results of Step 1 and Step 2: the result is called the **_combined rate_**.

       * Step 4.	Work out the amount of pension PP (single) that would, if section 514D did not apply, have been payable to the surviving partner on the surviving partner's payday immediately before the first available bereavement adjustment payday: the result is called the **_surviving partner's individual rate_**.

       * Step 5.	Take the surviving partner's individual rate away from the combined rate: the result is called the **_deceased partner's instalment component_**.

       * Step 6.	Work out the number of the deceased partner's paydays in the bereavement lump sum period.

       * Step 7.	Multiply the deceased partner's instalment component by the number obtained in Step 6: the result is the amount of the lump sum payable to the surviving partner under this section.

##### 514D  Adjustment of person's parenting payment rate

    * (1) This section applies if a surviving partner:

      * (a) is qualified for payments under this Subdivision; and

      * (b) does not elect under subsection 514A(2) not to receive payments under this Subdivision.

    * (2) The surviving partner's parenting payment rate during the bereavement rate continuation period is the benefit PP (partnered) rate that would have been payable to the surviving partner if:

      * (a) the deceased partner had not died; and

      * (b) if the couple had been an illness separated couple or a respite care couple--they had not been such a couple.

    * (3) The surviving partner's parenting payment rate during the bereavement lump sum period (if any) is the pension PP (single) rate.

         * Note 1: For **_bereavement period_**, **_bereavement rate continuation period_**, **_bereavement lump sum period_** and **_first available bereavement adjustment payday_** see section 21.

         * Note 2: For **_illness separated couple_** and **_respite care couple_** see subsections 4(7) and (8) respectively.

         * Note 3: For **_pension PP (single)_** and **_benefit PP (partnered) _**see section 18.

##### 514E  Effect of death of surviving partner

    * If: 

      * (a) a surviving partner is qualified for payments under this Subdivision in relation to the death of the deceased partner; and

      * (b) the surviving partner dies within the bereavement period; and

      * (c) the Secretary does not become aware of the death of the deceased partner before the surviving partner dies;

    * there is payable, as a lump sum, to any person that the Secretary thinks appropriate, an amount worked out using the following Lump Sum Calculator:

Lump Sum Calculator

    * This is how to work out the amount of the lump sum: 

Method statement

       * Step 1.	Work out the amount that would have been payable to the surviving partner on the surviving partner's payday immediately after the day on which the surviving partner died if:

         * (a) neither the surviving partner nor the deceased partner had died; and

         * (b) if, immediately before the deceased partner's death, the couple were an illness separated couple or a respite care couple--they were not such a couple.

             * Note: For **_illness separated couple_** and **_respite care couple_** see subsections 4(7) and (8).

       * Step 2.	Work out the amount that would have been payable to the deceased partner on the deceased partner's payday immediately after the day on which the surviving partner died if:

         * (a) neither the surviving partner nor the deceased partner had died; and

         * (b) if, immediately before the deceased partner's death, the couple were an illness separated couple or a respite care couple--they were not such a couple.

             * Note: For **_illness separated couple_** and **_respite care couple_** see subsections 4(7) and (8).

       * Step 3.	Add the results of Step 1 and Step 2: the result is called the **_combined rate_**.

       * Step 4.	Work out the amount of pension PP (single) that would, if section 514D did not apply, have been payable to the surviving partner on the surviving partner's payday immediately after the day on which the surviving partner died if the surviving partner had not died: the result is called the **_surviving partner's individual rate_**.

       * Step 5.	Take the surviving partner's individual rate away from the combined rate: the result is called the **_deceased partner's instalment component_**.

       * Step 6.	Work out the number of the deceased partner's paydays in the period that commences on the day on which the surviving partner dies and ends on the day on which the bereavement period ends.

       * Step 7.	Multiply the deceased partner's instalment component by the number obtained in Step 6: the result is the amount of the lump sum payable under this section.

         * Note: For **_bereavement period_** and **_first available bereavement adjustment payday_** see section 21.

The subsection deems the person to be so qualified. As a result, the person may be paid a newstart allowance for the period beginning on the day after the day on which the person's last instalment of pension was paid. The subsection aims to ensure that there is minimal disruption to a person's payments when a person transfers from a pension to a newstart allowance.

    * If: 

      * (a) a person is qualified for payments under this Subdivision in relation to the death of the person's partner; and

    * there is payable to the person as a lump sum an amount worked out using the lump sum calculator at the end of this section.

LUMP SUM CALCULATOR

    * This is how to work out the amount of the lump sum: 

Method statement

       * Step 1.	Add up:

         * (a) the amount that, if the person's partner had not died, would have been payable to the person on the person's payday immediately before the first available bereavement adjustment payday; and

         * (b) the amount (if any) that, if the partner had not died, would have been payable to the partner on the partner's payday immediately before the first available bereavement adjustment payday;

       * the result is called the **_combined rate_**.

       * Step 2.	Work out the amount that, but for section 660LD, would have been payable to the person on the person's payday immediately before the first available bereavement adjustment payday: the result is called the **_person's individual rate_**.

       * Step 3.	Take the person's individual rate away from the combined rate: the result is called the **_partner's instalment component_**.

       * Step 4.	Work out the number of the partner's paydays in the bereavement lump sum period.

       * Step 5.	Multiply the partner's instalment component by the number obtained in Step 4: the result is the amount of the lump sum payable to the person under this section.

##### 660LD  Adjustment of a person's newstart allowance rate

    * If: 

      * (a) a person is qualified for payments under this Subdivision; and

      * (b) the person does not elect under subsection 660LA(2) not to receive payments under this Subdivision;

    * the rate of the person's newstart allowance during the bereavement period is worked out as follows:

      * (c) during the bereavement rate continuation period, the rate of newstart allowance payable to the person is the rate at which the allowance would have been payable to the person if the person's partner had not died;

      * (d) during the bereavement lump sum period (if any), the rate at which newstart allowance is payable to the person is the rate at which the allowance would be payable to the person apart from this Subdivision.

##### 660LE  Effect of death of person entitled to payments under this Subdivision

    * If: 

      * (a) a person is qualified for payments under this Subdivision in relation to the death of the person's partner; and

      * (b) the person dies within the bereavement period; and

      * (c) the Secretary does not become aware of the death of the person's partner before the person dies;

    * there is payable, to such person as the Secretary thinks appropriate, as a lump sum, an amount worked out using the lump sum calculator at the end of this section.

LUMP SUM CALCULATOR

    * This is how to work out the amount of the lump sum: 

Method statement

       * Step 1.	Add up:

         * (a) the amount that, if neither the person nor the person's partner had died, would have been payable to the person on the person's payday immediately after the day on which the person dies; and

         * (b) the amount (if any) that, if neither the person nor the person's partner had died, would have been payable to the person's partner on the partner's payday immediately after the day on which the person died;

       * the result is called the **_combined rate_**.

       * Step 2.	Work out the amount that, but for section 660LD, would have been payable to the person on the person's payday immediately after the day on which the person died if the person had not died: the result is called the **_person's individual rate_**.

       * Step 3.	Take the person's individual rate away from the combined pensioner couple rate: the result is called the **_partner's instalment component_**.

       * Step 4.	Work out the number of paydays of the partner in the period that commences on the day on which the person dies and ends on the day on which the bereavement period ends.

       * Step 5.	Multiply the partner's instalment component by the number obtained in Step 4: the result is the amount of the lump sum payable under this section.
