##### 4  Act to bind Crown

    * (2) Nothing in this Act permits the Crown to be prosecuted for an offence.

##### 5  Extension to Territories

    * This Act extends to all the external Territories.

##### 6  Objects of Act

    * The objects of this Act are to provide for: 

     * (a) the keeping of registers of details relating to:

      * (i) unclaimed money; and

      * (ii) certain amounts relating to superannuation of persons (**_former temporary residents_**) who used to be holders of temporary visas under the _Migration Act 1958_ and have left Australia; and

      * (iii) certain amounts relating to superannuation of persons who used to be lost members;

     * so that the money and amounts can be claimed by persons entitled to them; and

     * (b) the keeping of a register of details relating to lost members, so that the benefits of lost members can be claimed by persons entitled to them; and

     * (c) the matching of unclaimed money and persons entitled to it; and

     * (d) the matching of benefits of lost members and persons entitled to them; and

     * (f) the coordination of the collection of unclaimed money between the Commonwealth, States and Territories; and

     * (g) the coordination of the matching of unclaimed money and persons entitled to it between the Commonwealth, States and Territories.

##### 7  Outline of Act

    * The following is a simplified outline of this Act.

Unclaimed money register

     * At the times determined by the Commissioner, superannuation providers must give the Commissioner of Taxation details relating to any unclaimed money they hold in respect of members who have reached the eligibility age or who have died.

     * Unclaimed money is money in an inactive account which the superannuation provider is unable to ensure is received by a person entitled to receive it.

     * Superannuation providers must pay to the Commissioner of Taxation any unclaimed money they hold. Later, the Commissioner must, if satisfied that it is possible to do so, pay the amount he or she has received in respect of a person to:

       * (a) the person; or

       * (b) to a fund identified by the person; or

       * (c) if the person has died--to the person's death beneficiaries or legal personal representative.

     * If a State or Territory law regulates unclaimed money in a way consistent with this Act, superannuation providers that are trustees of public sector superannuation schemes may give details relating to the money, and pay the money, to the relevant State or Territory authority instead of paying it to the Commissioner of Taxation.

     * The Commissioner of Taxation may publish, or make available, details relating to unclaimed money in respect of members who have reached the eligibility age or who have died.

Superannuation of former temporary residents

     * The Commissioner of Taxation must give the superannuation provider for a fund a notice identifying a member of the fund if satisfied that the member is a former temporary resident.

     * The superannuation provider must give the Commissioner a statement and pay the Commissioner the amount that would be payable to the member if the member had requested payment in connection with leaving Australia (subject to reductions for amounts paid or payable from the fund in respect of the member).

     * If the Commissioner is satisfied he or she has received a payment under this Act for such a member, the Commissioner must pay the amount he or she has received (and interest, in some cases) to the member, to a fund identified by the member or, if the member has died, to the member's death beneficiaries or legal personal representative.

     * The Commissioner of Taxation may publish, or make available, details relating to amounts paid to the Commissioner in respect of such members.

Lost members register

     * The regulations may establish a scheme under which superannuation providers must provide the Commissioner of Taxation with details relating to lost members. An aim of the scheme would be to reduce at an early stage the number of accounts which become unclaimed money.

     * The Commissioner of Taxation may publish, or make available, details relating to lost members.

Superannuation of lost members

     * At the times determined by the Commissioner, superannuation providers must give the Commissioner of Taxation details relating to:

       * (a) small accounts of lost members; and

       * (b) inactive accounts of unidentifiable lost members.

     * Superannuation providers must pay to the Commissioner of Taxation the value of any such accounts. Later, the Commissioner must, if satisfied that it is possible to do so, pay an amount he or she has received in respect of a person:

       * (a) to a fund identified by the person; or

       * (b) if the person has reached eligibility age or the amount is less than $200--to the person; or

       * (c) if the person has died--to the person's death beneficiaries or legal personal representative.

Prescribed public sector superannuation schemes

     * The trustees of certain public sector superannuation schemes may comply with this Act in the same way as superannuation providers.

      * (i) this Part;

      * (ii) the _Superannuation (Departing Australia Superannuation Payments Tax) Act 2007_;

      * (iii) the _Income Tax Assessment Act 1997_, Part 3AA of this Act, and Chapters 2 and 4 in Schedule 1 to the _Taxation Administration Act 1953_, so far as they relate to this Part or the _Superannuation (Departing Australia Superannuation Payments Tax) Act 2007_.

       * Note 1: The _Taxation Administration Act 1953_ provides for offences and administrative penalties if the statement includes false or misleading information: see sections 8K and 8N of that Act and Division 284 in Schedule 1 to that Act.

       * Note 2: The approved form may also require the statement to include certain tax file numbers: see subsection 25(2A).

    * When statement must be given

    * (2) The superannuation provider must give the Commissioner the statement by the end of:

     * (a) the next scheduled statement day after the notice is given; or

     * (b) if the Commissioner gives the notice less than 28 days before the next scheduled statement day--the following scheduled statement day.

       * Example: Suppose that 1 May and 1 November each year are the scheduled statement days, and that the Commissioner gives the notice to the superannuation provider on 15 April in a year. The superannuation provider must give the Commissioner the statement by the end of 1 November that year (rather than 1 May that year).

       * Note 1: The Commissioner may defer the time for giving the statement: see section 38855 in Schedule 1 to the _Taxation Administration Act 1953_.

       * Note 2: The _Taxation Administration Act 1953_ provides for offences and administrative penalties if the statement is not given when it must be: see section 8C of that Act and Division 286 in Schedule 1 to that Act.

    * Statement required even if person does not have interest

    * (3) The superannuation provider must give the Commissioner the statement even if:

     * (a) the person does not have a superannuation interest when the superannuation provider must give the statement; or

     * (b) the superannuation provider is not required by subsection 20F(1) to pay the Commissioner an amount in respect of the person.

##### 20F  Superannuation provider must pay Commissioner unclaimed superannuation

    * (1) The superannuation provider must pay the Commissioner (for the Commonwealth) the excess (if any) of the amount worked out under subsection (2) for the person's superannuation interest over the total worked out under subsection (3) for the interest by the time at which the excess is due and payable. The excess is due and payable at the end of:

     * (a) the next scheduled statement day after the notice is given; or

     * (b) if the Commissioner gives the notice less than 28 days before the next scheduled statement day--the following scheduled statement day; or

     * (c) if a day is identified for the superannuation provider under the regulations that is later than the day described in paragraph (a) and later than the day described in paragraph (b) if it is relevant--that later day.

       * Note 1: The amount the superannuation provider must pay the Commissioner is a taxrelated liability for the purposes of the _Taxation Administration Act 1953_. Division 255 in Schedule 1 to that Act deals with payment and recovery of taxrelated liabilities. Division 284 in that Schedule provides for administrative penalties connected with such liabilities.

       * Note 2: The Commissioner may defer the time at which the excess is due and payable: see section 25510 in Schedule 1 to the _Taxation Administration Act 1953_.

       * Note 3: Section 20K provides for refunds of overpayments by the superannuation provider to the Commissioner.

    * (2) Work out the amount that would have been payable to the person from the fund in respect of the superannuation interest had the person requested payment in connection with the person's departure from Australia. For this purpose:

     * (a) work out the amount that would have been payable at the time (the **_calculation time_**) immediately before:

      * (i) the time at which a payment under subsection (1) in respect of the person is due and payable (assuming that such a payment must be made); or

      * (ii) for a payment to be made under subsection (1) before it is due and payable--the time the payment is to be made; and

     * (b) assume that the request were made before the calculation time; and

     * (c) assume that the person had not died before the calculation time.

    * (3) Total:

     * (a) the amount (if any) that is payable from the fund because regulations made for the purposes of the RSA Act or the SIS Act require or permit a benefit connected with the person's superannuation interest to be cashed; and

     * (b) if the person has actually died, the amount (if any) that has been paid from the fund in respect of the person because of the person's death; and

     * (c) the amount (if any) of the person's superannuation interest that supports a superannuation income stream (within the meaning of regulations made for the purposes of the _Income Tax Assessment Act 1997_); and

     * (d) the amount (if any) worked out in accordance with the regulations made for the purposes of this paragraph.

    * Work out the amounts described in paragraphs (a), (b), (c) and (d) as at the calculation time.

    * (4) For the purposes of subsections (2) and (3):

     * (a) disregard Subdivision 12FA in Schedule 1 to the _Taxation Administration Act 1953_; and

     * (b) take account only of the person's entitlement to payment remaining after any reduction by a payment split under Part VIIIB of the _Family Law Act 1975_ (disregarding subsection 90MB(3) of that Act).

       * Note 1: Subdivision 12FA in Schedule 1 to the _Taxation Administration Act 1953_ is about withholding amounts from departing Australia superannuation payments.

       * Note 2: Part VIIIB of the _Family Law Act 1975_ is about splitting amounts payable in respect of a superannuation interest between the parties to a marriage. Subsection 90MB(3) of that Act provides that the Part has effect subject to this Act.

    * Regulations for the purposes of paragraph (1)(c)

    * (4A) Regulations for the purposes of paragraph (1)(c) may provide for a day to be identified by the Commissioner or the Australian Prudential Regulation Authority. This does not limit the provision that the regulations may make for identification of a day for those purposes.

    * General interest charge on late payment

    * (5) If any of the amount the superannuation provider must pay under subsection (1) remains unpaid after it is due and payable, the superannuation provider is liable to pay general interest charge on the unpaid amount for each day in the period that:

     * (a) starts at the time it is due and payable; and

     * (b) ends at the end of the last day on which either of the following remains unpaid:

      * (i) the amount unpaid when it is due and payable;

      * (ii) general interest charge on any of the amount.

    * Offence of failing to pay on time

    * (6) A person commits an offence if:

     * (a) the person is subject to a requirement under subsection (1); and

     * (b) the person engages in conduct; and

     * (c) the person's conduct breaches the requirement.

      * Penalty: 100 penalty units.

##### 20G  Effect of payment by superannuation provider

    * On payment of an amount to the Commissioner as required by subsection 20F(1), the superannuation provider is discharged from further liability to the person, and to anyone else in respect of the person, in respect of that amount.

#### Division 4--Payment by Commissioner

##### 20H  Payment by Commissioner in respect of person for whom an amount has been paid to Commissioner

    * (1) This section applies in relation to a person if the Commissioner is satisfied, on application in the approved form or on the Commissioner's own initiative, that:

     * (a) either:

      * (i) the person has been identified in a notice under section 20C; or

      * (ii) the person was, under the _Migration Act 1958_, the holder of a temporary visa, except a visa prescribed by the regulations, that ceased to be in effect at least 6 months ago, and the person left Australia at least 6 months ago but after starting to be the holder of the visa; and

     * (b) the total of:

      * (i) the amounts (if any) paid to the Commissioner under subsection 17(1) (before, on or after the commencement of this section) in respect of the person; and

      * (ii) the amounts (if any) paid to the Commissioner under subsection 20F(1) in respect of the person; and

      * (iia) the amounts (if any) paid to the Commissioner under section 24E in respect of the person;

     * exceeds the total of: 

      * (iii) the amounts (if any) paid by the Commissioner under subsection 17(2) (before, on or after the commencement of this section) in respect of the person; and

      * (iv) the amounts (if any) paid by the Commissioner under all the earlier operations (if any) of subsections (2) and (3) of this section in respect of the person (disregarding an amount paid under subsection (3), to the extent the amount was attributable to interest that would have been payable under subsection (2A) apart from subsection (3)); and

      * (v) the amounts (if any) paid by the Commissioner under section 20K in respect of the person; and

      * (vi) the amounts (if any) paid by the Commissioner under subsection 24G(2) in respect of the person.

    * (2) The Commissioner must pay the excess:

     * (a) to the person; or

     * (b) to a single fund that is a complying superannuation plan (within the meaning of the _Income Tax Assessment Act 1997_), if the person directs the Commissioner to pay to the fund and the Commissioner is satisfied that the person is:

      * (i) an Australian citizen; or

      * (ii) a New Zealand citizen; or

      * (iii) under the _Migration Act 1958_, the holder of a permanent visa or a visa prescribed by the regulations; or

     * (c) to the person's legal personal representative, if the person has died.

    * (2AA) If the Commissioner makes a payment under subsection (2) on or after 1 July 2013, the Commissioner must also pay to the person, fund or legal personal representative the amount of interest (if any) worked out in accordance with the regulations.

    * (2AB) Regulations made for the purposes of subsection (2AA) may prescribe different rates for different periods over which the interest accrues. For this purpose, **_rate_** includes a nil rate.

    * (2A) If the Commissioner makes a payment under subsection (2) before 1 July 2013, the Commissioner must also pay to the person, fund or legal personal representative the amount (if any) of interest worked out under subsection (2B), if the Commissioner is satisfied that:

     * (a) the person is (or was just before dying) an Australian citizen or, under the _Migration Act 1958_, the holder of a permanent visa; and

     * (b) after 30 June 2007 either:

      * (i) the person left Australia; or

      * (ii) the person was, under the _Migration Act 1958_, the holder of a temporary visa.

    * (2B) Work out, in accordance with the regulations, the amount of interest:

     * (a) on so much (if any) of the excess as is attributable (directly or indirectly) to one or more amounts paid to the Commissioner under subsection 20F(1) and not to payments to or by the Commissioner under subsection 17(1) or (2), section 24E or subsection 24G(2); and

     * (b) at a rate equal to the annual yield on Treasury bonds with a 10year term or, if another rate is prescribed by the regulations, that other rate.

       * Note: The regulations may provide for various matters relevant to working out the interest, such as working out the periods for which particular rates apply to particular amounts of principal (which will affect any compounding of the interest, among other things).

    * (2C) Regulations for the purposes of subsection (2B) may prescribe different rates for different periods over which the interest accrues, including a nil rate for any period starting when the person turns 65. This does not limit the ways in which the regulations may provide for working out the amount of interest under that subsection.

    * (3) However, if the person has died and the Commissioner is satisfied that one or more superannuation providers that made any of the payments described in subparagraphs (1)(b)(i), (ii) and (iia) would, if they had not made those payments, have been required because of the person's death to pay an amount to one or more other persons (the **_death beneficiaries_**), the Commissioner must pay each death beneficiary:

     * (a) the total of the amounts the Commissioner is satisfied the superannuation providers would have been required to pay the death beneficiary; or

     * (b) if the total of the excess and any interest that would be payable under subsection (2AA) or (2A) apart from this subsection is less than the sum of the totals described in paragraph (a) for all the death beneficiaries--the amount worked out for the death beneficiary using the formula in subsection (4).

       * Note: Money for payments under this section is appropriated by section 16 of the _Taxation Administration Act 1953_.

    * (4) The formula is:

    * Withholding tax from payment

    * (5) For the purposes of subparagraph (1)(b)(iv), an amount withheld under Division 12 in Schedule 1 to the _Taxation Administration Act 1953_ from a payment under this section is taken to have been paid by the Commissioner.

    * (6) To avoid doubt, subsection (2) has effect subject to Division 12 in Schedule 1 to the _Taxation Administration Act 1953_.

       * Note: Division 12 in Schedule 1 to the _Taxation Administration Act 1953_ requires entities paying departing Australia superannuation payments and excess untaxed rollover amounts to withhold amounts from those payments.

#### Division 5--Various rules for special cases

##### 20J  Revoking Commissioner's notice to superannuation provider about person

    * Requirement for revocation

    * Means of revocation

    * (2) The revocation must be made by written notice given to the superannuation provider.

    * Effect of revocation

    * (3) If the Commissioner revokes a notice given to a superannuation provider about a person under section 20C, this Act has effect as if the notice had never been given.

    * No revocation if payment already made

    * (4) However, the revocation of a notice given to a superannuation provider about a person under section 20C has no effect if a condition in subsection (5) or (6) exists.

    * (5) One condition is that, before the revocation, the superannuation provider has made a payment to the Commissioner under subsection 20F(1) because of the notice.

    * (6) The other condition is that:

     * (a) notice of the revocation is given to the superannuation provider less than 28 days before the scheduled statement day by the end of which an amount would be due and payable under subsection 20F(1) because of the notice under section 20C, apart from:

      * (i) the revocation; and

      * (ia) paragraph 20F(1)(c); and

      * (ii) any deferral under section 25510 in Schedule 1 to the _Taxation Administration Act 1953_; and

     * (b) before the end of that day, the superannuation provider:

      * (ii) does not permit the trustee to give a statement to the Commissioner if the governing rules of the scheme prohibit the trustee from giving the statement to the Commissioner; and

     * (c) section 20F (payment of unclaimed superannuation):

    * (3) The persons from whom the Commissioner may recover are as follows:

    * (6) The Commissioner may revoke a notice described in paragraph (4)(a).

    * (7) The total of the amounts recovered from different debtors in relation to the same excess must not be more than the excess.
