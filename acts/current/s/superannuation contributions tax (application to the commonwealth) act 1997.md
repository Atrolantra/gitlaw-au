##### 3  Interpretation

   * (1) Subject to subsection (2), any expression that is used in this Act and in the _Superannuation Contributions Tax (Assessment and Collection) Act 1997_ has the same meaning as in that Act.

   * (2) For the purposes of the application of the _Superannuation Contributions Tax (Assessment and Collection) Act 1997_ to a trustee of an unfunded defined benefits superannuation scheme to whom section 5 of this Act applies, a reference in that Act to superannuation contributions surcharge includes a reference to superannuation contributions surcharge that is payable because of the operation of that section.

   * (3) In this Act:

   * **_Finance Minister_** has the meaning given by the _Income Tax Assessment Act 1997_.

##### 4  Application of Act

   * This Act applies if: 

    * (a) the trustee of an unfunded defined benefits superannuation scheme is an officer, authority or agent of the Commonwealth in the trustee's capacity as trustee of the scheme; and

    * (b) were the trustee not such an officer, authority or agent, the trustee would be liable to pay superannuation contributions surcharge on superannuation contributions for a financial year of a member of the scheme; and

    * (c) there are no contributed amounts payable to the trustee for or by the member under the scheme.

##### 5  Trustee taken not to be officer, authority or agent of the Commonwealth

   * The trustee is taken, for the purposes of the _Superannuation Contributions Tax Imposition Act 1997_ and the _Superannuation Contributions Tax (Assessment and Collection) Act 1997_, not to be an officer, authority or agent of the Commonwealth in the trustee's capacity as trustee of the scheme.

##### 6  Directions by Finance Minister

   * (1) The Finance Minister may give any written directions that are necessary or convenient to be given for discharging the trustee's liability to pay the surcharge that arises because of the operation of section 5 and, in particular, may give directions in relation to the transfer of money within the Public Account.

   * (2) Directions under subsection (1) have effect, and are to be complied with, despite any other law of the Commonwealth.

##### 7  Discharge of liability of trustee

   * Compliance with any directions given under section 6 is taken, for the purposes of the _Superannuation Contributions Tax (Assessment and Collection) Act 1997_ to discharge the trustee's liability to pay the surcharge.
