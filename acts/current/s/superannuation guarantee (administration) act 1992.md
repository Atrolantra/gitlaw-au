    * (2) A scheme embodied in the governing rules of a superannuation fund (other than a scheme of the kind referred to in subsection (1)) is a defined benefit superannuation scheme if a conversion notice has effect in relation to the fund or scheme.

    * (3) If the conversion notice is expressed to take effect on a day before the day on which the notice is given, the scheme in question is taken to have been a defined benefit superannuation scheme from the day on which the notice is expressed to take effect.

      * (a) the trustee's intention to give the notice; and

      * (b) the proposed date of effect of the notice.

    * (5) If an employer begins contributing to a superannuation fund or a superannuation scheme for the benefit of employees at a time when a conversion notice has effect in relation to the fund or scheme, the trustee must give the employer written notice of:

#### Division 8--Miscellaneous

##### 32X  Application of Part to different employers of an employee

    * This Part applies separately to each employer of an employee. For example, a fund that is a chosen fund of an employee as a result of a standard choice form being given by an employer is only a chosen fund in relation to the operation of these provisions to that employer.

##### 32Y  Notional earnings base to continue to be used

    * (1) This section applies if:

      * (a) an employer is contributing to a fund (the **_choice fund_**) that is a chosen fund of an employee; and

      * (b) it is reasonable to assume that, if the choice of fund requirements did not apply, the employer would instead have contributed to a different fund (the **_other fund_**) for the benefit of that employee; and

      * (c) contributions to the other fund would not have been covered by subsection 23(5).

    * (2) This section also applies if:

      * (a) an employer is contributing to a fund (the **_choice fund_**) that is a chosen fund of an employee; and

      * (b) it is reasonable to assume that, if the choice of fund requirements did not apply, that a reduction in the charge percentage for the employer would have been made under subsection 22(2) as a result of a scheme (the **_other fund_**) for the benefit of that employee.

    * (3) In working out the reduction in the charge percentage under subsection 23(2), (3), (4), (4A) or (4D) as a result of a contribution to the choice fund, the employee's notional earnings base is taken to be equal to the lesser of that notional earnings base and the amount that would have been the employee's notional earnings base if the contribution had been made to the other fund, or the reduction had been made under subsection 22(2) as a result of the other fund (as the case requires).

    * (4) In working out the reduction in the charge percentage under subsection 23(5) as a result of a contribution to the choice fund, the employee's ordinary time earnings are taken to be equal to the lesser of those ordinary time earnings and the amount that would have been the employee's notional earnings base if the contribution had been made to the other fund, or the reduction had been made under subsection 22(2) as a result of the other fund (as the case requires).

##### 32Z  Contributions satisfy Commonwealth or Territory industrial award requirements

    * A requirement in a Commonwealth industrial award or a Territory industrial award that an employer make contributions to a superannuation fund on behalf of an employee is not enforceable to the extent that the employer instead makes the contributions on behalf of the employee, in compliance with this Part, to another superannuation fund that is a chosen fund.

##### 32ZAA  Contributions satisfy State or Territory law requirements

    * (1) This section applies to an employer that is a corporation to which paragraph 51(xx) of the Constitution applies.

    * (2) A requirement in a law of a State or Territory that the employer make contributions to a superannuation fund on behalf of an employee is not enforceable to the extent that the employer instead makes the contributions on behalf of the employee, in compliance with this Part, to another superannuation fund that is a chosen fund.

##### 32ZA  Employers not liable for damages

    * An employer is not liable to compensate any person for loss or damage arising from anything done by the employer in complying with this Part.

    * (2) Subject to this section, if there has been an avoidance of superannuation guarantee charge, the Commissioner may:

      * (a) if the Commissioner is of the opinion that the avoidance of the charge is due to fraud or evasion--at any time; or

      * (b) in any other case--within 4 years from the day on which the assessment is made;

      * (a) in respect of an employee or employees; and

      * (b) made by or on behalf of an employer;

    * to the extent that, as a result of the amount being paid to the Commonwealth, a liability of the employer to pay superannuation guarantee charge in respect of that employee or those employees is discharged under subsection 26820(3), or section 26940, in Schedule 1 to the _Taxation Administration Act 1953_.

      * (c) any nominal interest component for the quarter that has been paid by, or is payable at, the particular time;

    * reduced (but not below zero) by the amounts of any previous payments to which this Part applies that relate to the same quarter, employer and employees.
