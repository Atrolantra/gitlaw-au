     * (3) A retrieval warrant may authorise the doing of anything reasonably necessary to conceal the fact that anything has been done in relation to the retrieval of a surveillance device or enhancement equipment under the warrant but cannot authorise the use, for any purpose, of the surveillance device specified in the warrant.

##### 27  Revocation of retrieval warrant

##### 35  Judge or nominated AAT member may approve giving of emergency authorisations

     * (1) After considering an application for approval of the giving of an emergency authorisation under section 28, the eligible Judge or nominated AAT member may approve the application if satisfied that there were reasonable grounds to suspect that:

      * (a) there was a risk of serious violence to a person or substantial damage to property; and

      * (b) using a surveillance device may have helped reduce the risk; and

      * (c) it was not practicable in the circumstances to apply for a surveillance device warrant.

     * (2) After considering an application for approval of the giving of an emergency authorisation under section 29 in relation to a recovery order, the eligible Judge or nominated AAT member may approve the application if satisfied that:

      * (a) the recovery order was in force at the time the emergency authorisation was given; and

      * (b) there were reasonable grounds to suspect that:

       * (i) the enforcement of the recovery order was urgent; and

       * (ii) using a surveillance device may have assisted in the prompt location and safe recovery of the child to whom the order relates; and

       * (iii) it was not practicable in the circumstances to apply for a surveillance device warrant.

     * (3) After considering an application for approval of the giving of an emergency authorisation under section 30, the eligible Judge or nominated AAT member may approve the application if satisfied that:

      * (b) if the Judge or member is satisfied that since the application for the emergency authorisation the activity that required surveillance has ceased--order that the use of the surveillance device cease.

     * (5) If, under subsection (1), (2) or (3), the eligible Judge or nominated AAT member does not approve the giving of an emergency authorisation, the Judge or member may:

      * (a) order that the use of the surveillance device cease; or

      * (b) if the Judge or member is of the view that although the situation did not warrant the emergency authorisation at the time that authorisation was given, the use of a surveillance device warrant under Division 2 of Part 2 is currently justified--issue a surveillance device warrant for the subsequent use of such a device as if the application for the approval were an application for a surveillance device warrant under Division 2 of Part 2.

     * (6) In any case, the eligible Judge or nominated AAT member may order that any information obtained from or relating to the exercise of powers under the emergency authorisation, or any record of that information, be dealt with in a manner specified in the order, not being a manner that involves the destruction of that information.

##### 36  Admissibility of evidence

     * If the giving of an emergency authorisation is approved under section 35, any evidence obtained because of the exercise of powers under that authorisation is not inadmissible in any proceeding only because the evidence was obtained before the approval.

      * (a) in a foreign country; or

      * (b) on a vessel or aircraft that is registered under the law of a foreign country and is in or above waters beyond the outer limits of the territorial sea of Australia;

     * (2) If:

      * (a) application is made under section 33 by an appropriate authorising officer who is a federal law enforcement officer for approval of the giving of an emergency authorisation relating to the investigation of a relevant offence; and

       * (i) in a foreign country; or

       * (ii) on a vessel or aircraft that is registered under the law of a foreign country and is in or above waters beyond the outer limits of the territorial sea of Australia;

      * to assist in the investigation to which the emergency authorisation related;

     * (3) If:

      * (a) a warrant has been issued in relation to the investigation of a relevant offence on an application by or on behalf of a federal law enforcement officer; and

      * (b) after the issue of the warrant it becomes apparent to the law enforcement officer primarily responsible for executing the warrant that there will be a need for surveillance:

      * (a) a vessel that is registered under the law of a foreign country is in waters beyond the outer limits of the territorial sea of Australia but not beyond the outer limits of the contiguous zone of Australia; and

      * (b) the relevant offence in respect of which it becomes apparent that surveillance on the vessel will be required is an offence relating to the customs, fiscal, immigration or sanitary laws of Australia;

     * (5) Despite subsections (1), (2) and (3), if:

      * (a) a vessel that is registered under the law of a foreign country is in waters beyond the outer limits of the territorial sea of Australia but not beyond the outer limits of the Australian fishing zone; and

     * (8) If a vessel or aircraft that is registered under the laws of a foreign country is in or above the territorial sea of another foreign country, subsections (1), (2) and (3) have effect as if the reference to an appropriate consenting official of the foreign country were a reference to an appropriate consenting official of each foreign country concerned.

     * (9) For the avoidance of doubt, there is no requirement for the agreement of an appropriate consenting official of the foreign country to the surveillance under the authority of a warrant of a vessel or aircraft of a foreign country that is in Australia or in or above waters within the outer limits of the territorial sea of Australia.
