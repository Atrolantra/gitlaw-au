LUMP SUM CALCULATOR

    * This is how to work out the amount of the lump sum: 

Method statement

       * Step 1.	Work out the amount that would have been payable to the person on the person's payday immediately before the first available bereavement adjustment payday if:

         * (a) the person's partner had not died; and

         * (b) where immediately before the partner's death the couple were an illness separated couple or a respite care couple--they were not such a couple.

       * Step 2.	Work out the amount that would have been payable to the person's partner on the partner's payday or service payday immediately before the first available bereavement adjustment payday if:

         * (a) the partner had not died; and

         * (b) where immediately before the partner's death the couple were an illness separated couple or a respite care couple--they were not such a couple.

       * Step 3.	Add the results of Step 1 and Step 2: the result is called the **_combined rate_**.

       * Step 4.	Work out the amount that, but for section 660XKD, would have been payable to the person on the person's payday immediately before the first available bereavement adjustment payday: the result is called the **_person's individual rate_**.

       * Step 5.	Take the person's individual rate away from the combined rate: the result is called the **_partner's instalment component_**.

       * Step 6.	Work out the number of paydays of the partner in the bereavement lump sum period.

       * Step 7.	Multiply the partner's instalment component by the number obtained in Step 6: the result is the amount of the lump sum payable to the person under this section.

##### 660XKD  Adjustment of person's mature age allowance rate

    * If: 

     * (a) a person is qualified for payments under this Subdivision; and

    * there is payable, to such person as the Secretary thinks appropriate, as a lump sum, an amount worked out using the lump sum calculator at the end of this section.

LUMP SUM CALCULATOR

    * This is how to work out the amount of the lump sum: 

Method statement

       * Step 1.	Work out the amount that would have been payable to the person on the person's payday immediately after the day on which the person died if:

         * (a) neither the person nor the person's partner had died; and

         * (b) where immediately before the partner's death the couple were an illness separated couple or a respite care couple--they were not such a couple.

       * Step 4.	Work out the amount that, but for section 660XKD, would have been payable to the person on the person's payday immediately after the day on which the person died if the person had not died: the result is called the **_person's individual rate_**.

       * Step 5.	Take the person's individual rate away from the combined rate: the result is called the **_partner's instalment component_**.

       * Step 6.	Work out the number of paydays of the partner in the period that commences on the day on which the person dies and ends on the day on which the bereavement period ends.

       * Step 7.	Multiply the partner's instalment component by the number obtained in Step 6: the result is the amount of the lump sum payable under this section.

       * the result is called the **_combined rate_**.

       * Step 2.	Work out the amount that, but for section 728PD, would have been payable to the person on the person's payday immediately before the first available bereavement adjustment payday: the result is called the **_person's individual rate_**.

       * Step 3.	Take the person's individual rate away from the combined rate: the result is called the **_partner's instalment component_**.

       * Step 4.	Work out the number of the partner's paydays in the bereavement lump sum period.

       * Step 5.	Multiply the partner's instalment component by the number obtained in Step 4: the result is the amount of the lump sum payable to the person under this section.

##### 728PD  Adjustment of a person's sickness allowance rate

    * If: 

     * (a) a person is qualified for payments under this Subdivision; and

     * (b) the person does not elect under subsection 728PA(2) not to receive payments under this Subdivision;

    * the rate of the person's sickness allowance during the bereavement period is worked out as follows:

     * (c) during the bereavement rate continuation period, the rate of sickness allowance payable to the person is the rate at which the allowance would have been payable to the person if the person's partner had not died;

     * (d) during the bereavement lump sum period (if any), the rate at which sickness allowance is payable to the person is the rate at which the allowance would be payable to the person apart from this Subdivision.

##### 728PE  Effect of death of person entitled to payments under this Subdivision

    * If: 

     * (a) a person is qualified for payments under this Subdivision in relation to the death of the person's partner; and

     * (b) the person dies within the bereavement period; and

     * (c) the Secretary does not become aware of the death of the person's partner before the person dies;

    * there is payable, to such person as the Secretary thinks appropriate, as a lump sum, an amount worked out using the lump sum calculator at the end of this section.

LUMP SUM CALCULATOR

    * This is how to work out the amount of the lump sum: 

Method statement

       * Step 1.	Add up:

         * (a) the amount that, if neither the person nor the person's partner had died, would have been payable to the person on the person's payday immediately after the day on which the person dies; and

         * (b) the amount (if any) that, if neither the person nor the person's partner had died, would have been payable to the person's partner on the partner's payday immediately after the day on which the person died;

       * _	_the result is called the **_combined rate_**.

       * Step 2.	Work out the amount that, but for section 728PD, would have been payable to the person on the person's payday immediately after the day on which the person died if the person had not died: the result is called the **_person's individual rate_**.

       * Step 3.	Take the person's individual rate away from the combined pensioner couple rate: the result is called the **_partner's instalment component_**.

       * Step 4.	Work out the number of paydays of the partner in the period that commences on the day on which the person dies and ends on the day on which the bereavement period ends.

       * Step 5.	Multiply the partner's instalment component by the number obtained in Step 4: the result is the amount of the lump sum payable under this section.

    * (3) The Secretary is not to determine that a special benefit should be granted to a person for a period if the Secretary is satisfied that the benefit is not payable to the person for that period.

    * (4) For the purposes of paragraph (2)(d), a newstart allowance is to be taken to be not payable to a person for a period because of the operation of a provision if:

     * (a) the person has claimed the allowance for the period and the allowance is not payable to the person because of the operation of the provision; or

     * (b) were the person to claim the allowance for the period the allowance would not be payable to the person because of the operation of the provision.

     * (c) the person becomes qualified for a special benefit at some time during the 14 day period but after the first day of that period;

    * the person is taken to be qualified for a special benefit for the whole of the 14 day period.

         * Note: Subsection (6) operates when a person transfers from a pension to a special benefit and the person is not qualified for a special benefit immediately after the day on which the person's last instalment of pension is paid. The subsection deems the person to be so qualified. As a result, the person may be paid a special benefit for the period beginning on the day after the day on which the person's last instalment of pension was paid. The subsection aims to ensure that there is minimal disruption to a person's payments when a person transfers from a pension to a special benefit.

     * (c) the person was not a member of the trade union during the period of the industrial action.

    * (3) Subject to subsection (4), subsections (1) and (2) do not prevent a person from being qualified for special benefit in respect of a period that occurs after the relevant industrial action or series of industrial actions has stopped.

    * (4) If the relevant industrial action or series of industrial actions is in breach of an order, direction or injunction issued by:

     * (a) a prescribed State industrial authority within the meaning of the _Fair Work Act 2009_; or

    * (9) A person cannot be taken to satisfy the activity test throughout a period if the person fails to comply with a requirement under subsection (7):

     * (b) the child could be provided with other care that the person considers to be suitable; or

     * (c) the child could be attending school, and attendance at that school would, in the Secretary's opinion, be appropriate in the circumstances.

    * If a person is qualified for payments under this Subdivision in relation to the death of the person's partner, there is payable to the person, on each of the partner's paydays in the bereavement rate continuation period, an amount equal to the amount that would have been payable to the partner on that payday if the partner had not died.

##### 768C  Lump sum payable in some circumstances

    * If: 

     * (a) a person is qualified for payments under this Subdivision in relation to the death of the person's partner; and

     * (b) the first available bereavement adjustment payday occurs before the end of the bereavement period;

    * there is payable to the person as a lump sum an amount worked out using the lump sum calculator at the end of this section.

LUMP SUM CALCULATOR

    * This is how to work out the amount of the lump sum: 

Method statement

       * Step 1.	Add up:

         * (a) the amount that, if the person's partner had not died, would have been payable to the person on the person's payday immediately before the first available bereavement adjustment payday; and

         * (b) the amount (if any) that, if the partner had not died, would have been payable to the partner on the partner's payday immediately before the first available bereavement adjustment payday;

       * the result is called the **_combined rate_**.

       * Step 2.	Work out the amount that, but for section 768D, would have been payable to the person on the person's payday immediately before the first available bereavement adjustment payday: the result is called the **_person's individual rate_**.

       * Step 3.	Take the person's individual rate away from the combined rate: the result is called the **_partner's instalment component_**.

       * Step 4.	Work out the number of the partner's paydays in the bereavement lump sum period.

       * Step 5.	Multiply the partner's instalment component by the number obtained in Step 4: the result is the amount of the lump sum payable to the person under this section.

##### 768D  Adjustment of a person's special benefit rate

    * If: 

     * (a) a person is qualified for payments under this Subdivision; and

     * (b) the person does not elect under subsection 768A(2) not to receive payments under this Subdivision;

    * the rate of the person's special benefit during the bereavement period is worked out as follows:

     * (c) during the bereavement rate continuation period, the rate of special benefit payable to the person is the rate at which the allowance would have been payable to the person if the person's partner had not died;

     * (d) during the bereavement lump sum period (if any), the rate at which special benefit is payable to the person is the rate at which the allowance would be payable to the person apart from this Subdivision.

##### 768E  Effect of death of person entitled to payments under this Subdivision

    * If: 

     * (a) a person is qualified for payments under this Subdivision in relation to the death of the person's partner; and

     * (b) the person dies within the bereavement period; and

     * (c) the Secretary does not become aware of the death of the person's partner before the person dies;

    * there is payable, to such person as the Secretary thinks appropriate, as a lump sum, an amount worked out using the lump sum calculator at the end of this section.

LUMP SUM CALCULATOR

    * This is how to work out the amount of the lump sum: 

Method statement

       * Step 1.	Add up:

         * (a) the amount that, if neither the person nor the person's partner had died, would have been payable to the person on the person's payday immediately after the day on which the person dies; and

         * (b) the amount (if any) that, if neither the person nor the person's partner had died, would have been payable to the person's partner on the partner's payday immediately after the day on which the person died;

       * the result is called the **_combined rate_**.

       * Step 2.	Work out the amount that, but for section 768D, would have been payable to the person on the person's payday immediately after the day on which the person died if the person had not died: the result is called the **_person's individual rate_**.

       * Step 3.	Take the person's individual rate away from the combined pensioner couple rate: the result is called the **_partner's instalment component_**.

       * Step 4.	Work out the number of paydays of the partner in the period that commences on the day on which the person dies and ends on the day on which the bereavement period ends.

       * Step 5.	Multiply the partner's instalment component by the number obtained in Step 4: the result is the amount of the lump sum payable under this section.

##### 771NX  Lump sum payable in some circumstances

    * (1) If:

     * (a) a surviving partner is qualified for payments under this Subdivision in relation to the death of the deceased partner; and

LUMP SUM CALCULATOR

    * This is how to work out the amount of the lump sum: 

Method statement

       * Step 1.	Work out the amount that would have been payable to the surviving partner on the surviving partner's payday immediately before the first available bereavement adjustment payday if:

         * (a) the deceased partner had not died; and

         * (b) if immediately before the partner's death the couple were an illness separated couple or a respite care couple--they were not such a couple.

             * Note: For **_illness separated couple_** and**_ respite care couple_** see subsections 4(7) and 4(8) respectively.

       * Step 2.	Work out the amount that would have been payable to the deceased partner on the deceased partner's payday immediately before the first available bereavement adjustment payday if:

         * (a) the deceased partner had not died; and

         * (b) if immediately before the partner's death the couple were an illness separated couple or a respite care couple--they were not such a couple.

             * Note: For **_illness separated couple_** and**_ respite care couple_** see subsections 4(7) and 4(8) respectively.

       * Step 3.	Add the results of Step 1 and Step 2: the result is called the **_combined rate_**.

       * Step 4.	Work out the **_surviving partner's notional rate_** using subsection (2), (2A), (3), (4), (5) or (6) (whichever applies).

             * Note: The subsection that you use depends on whether the deceased partner was receiving a job search allowance, newstart allowance, sickness allowance, special benefit, age pension, disability support pension or mature age allowance before he or she died.

       * Step 5.	Take the surviving partner's notional rate away from the combined rate: the result is called the **_deceased partner's instalment component_**.

       * Step 6.	Work out the number of the deceased partner's paydays in the bereavement lump sum period.

       * Step 7.	Multiply the deceased partner's instalment component by the number obtained in Step 6: the result is the amount of the lump sum payable to the surviving partner under this section.

    * Deceased partner receiving youth allowance or austudy payment

    * (2A) If, immediately before the deceased partner died, he or she was receiving youth allowance or austudy payment, the surviving partner's notional rate is the amount of youth allowance or austudy payment that would have been payable to the surviving partner on the surviving partner's pay day immediately before the first available bereavement adjustment pay day if:

     * (b) the surviving partner was not a member of a couple on that payday.

    * Deceased partner receiving sickness allowance

    * (4) If, immediately before the deceased partner died, he or she was receiving sickness allowance, the surviving partner's notional rate is the amount of sickness allowance that would have been payable to the surviving partner on the surviving partner's payday immediately before the first available bereavement adjustment payday if:

     * (a) a sickness allowance had been payable to the surviving partner on that payday; and

     * (b) the surviving partner was not a member of a couple on that payday.

    * Deceased partner receiving special benefit

    * (5) If, immediately before the deceased partner died, he or she was receiving special benefit, the surviving partner's notional rate is the amount of special benefit that would have been payable to the surviving partner on the surviving partner's payday immediately before the first available bereavement adjustment payday if:

    * there is payable as a lump sum, to any person that the Secretary thinks appropriate, an amount worked out using the following Lump Sum Calculator:

LUMP SUM CALCULATOR

    * This is how to work out the amount of the lump sum: 

Method statement

       * Step 1.	Work out the amount that would have been payable to the surviving partner on the surviving partner's payday immediately after the day on which the surviving partner died if:

         * (a) neither the surviving partner nor the deceased partner had died; and

         * (b) if immediately before the deceased partner's death the couple were an illness separated couple or a respite care couple--they were not such a couple.

         * (b) if immediately before the deceased partner's death the couple were an illness separated couple or a respite care couple--they were not such a couple.

             * Note: For **_illness separated couple_** and **_respite care couple_** see subsections 4(7) and 4(8) respectively.

       * Step 3.	Add the results of Step 1 and Step 2: the result is called the **_combined rate_**.

       * Step 4.	Work out the amount that, but for section 771NU, would have been payable to the surviving partner on the surviving partner's payday immediately after the day on which the surviving partner died if he or she had not died: the result is called the **_surviving partner's individual rate_**.

       * Step 5.	Take the surviving partner's individual rate away from the combined rate: the result is called the **_deceased partner's instalment component_**.

       * Step 6.	Work out the number of the surviving partner's paydays in the period that commences on the day on which the surviving partner dies and ends on the day on which the bereavement period ends.

       * Step 7.	Multiply the deceased partner's instalment component by the number obtained in Step 6: the result is the amount of the lump sum payable under this section.

#### Division 5--Rate of special needs pension

##### 796  How to work out a person's special needs pension rate

    * (1) Subject to subsection (2), the rate of a person's special needs pension is:

     * (a) if the pension is a special needs age pension--the rate at which an age pension would be payable to the person if the person were qualified for an age pension; or

     * (b) if the pension is a special needs disability support pension--the rate at which a disability support pension would be payable to the person if the person were qualified for a disability support pension; or

     * (c) if the pension is a special needs wife pension--the rate at which a wife pension would be payable to the person if the person were qualified for a wife pension; or

     * (e) if the pension is a special needs widow B pension--the rate at which a widow B pension would be payable to the person if the person were qualified for a widow B pension.

    * (2) If:

     * (a) the person was absent from  on 1 July 1986; and

     * (b) the person commences after 1 July 1986 to receive a special needs pension; and

     * (c) the person is absent from ;

    * the rate of the person's special needs pension is, subject to subsections (3) and (4), the person's special needs proportional rate worked out using the Special Needs Proportional Rate Calculator at the end of this section.

    * (3) Subsection (2) does not apply to a person's special needs disability support pension if the person became qualified for the pension because the person became permanently incapacitated for work or permanently blind while the person was an Australian resident.

    * (4) Subsection (2) does not apply to a person's special needs sole parent or widow B pension if:

     * (a) the person became qualified for the pension because of the death of the person's former partner; and

#### Special Needs Proportional Rate Calculator

##### Module A--Overall rate calculation process

    * Overall rate calculation process

    * 796A1		This is how to work out a person's special needs proportional rate:

Method statement

       * Step 1.	Work out the period of the person's Australian working life residence using Module B: the result is called the **_residence period_**.

       * Step 2.	Use the person's residence period to work out the person's **_residence factor_** using Module C below.

       * Step 3.	Work out the rate that would be the person's pension or allowance rate if this Rate Calculator did not apply to the person: the result is called the person's**_ notional domestic rate_**.

       * Step 4.	Multiply the person's notional domestic rate by the person's residence factor: the result is the person's special needs proportional rate.

##### Module B--Australian working life residence

    * Working life

    * 796B1		For the purposes of this Module, a person's **working life** is the period commencing when the person turn6 and ending:

     * (a) if the person is a woman--when she turns 60; or

     * (b) if the person is a man--when he turns 65.

    * Australian working life residence (general)

    * 796B2		Subject to points 796B3 to 796B9, a person's **_period of Australian working life residence_** as at a particular time is the number of months in the period, or the aggregate of the periods, during the person's working life during which the person has, up to that time, been an Australian resident.

    * Calculation of number of months

    * 796B3		If a person's period of Australian working life residence would, apart from this subsection, be a number of whole months, the period is to be increased by one month.

    * 796B4		If a person's period of Australian working life residence would, apart from this subsection, be a number of whole months and a day or days, the period is to be increased so that it is equal to the number of months plus one month.

    * Australian working life residence (special needs age or disability support pensioner couples)

    * Australian working life residence (special needs wife pensioner)

    * 796B7		If a person is receiving a special needs wife pension, the person's period of Australian working life residence is equal to the period of Australian working life residence of the person's partner.

    * Australian working life residence (recipient of special needs sole parent pension or widow B pension)

    * 796B8		If:

    * 796B9		If: 

     * (a) a special needs pension is payable to a person (in this point called the **_initial pension_**); and

     * (b) the special needs pension is cancelled or ceases to be payable automatically; and

     * (c) another special needs pension is payable to the person (in this point called the **_second pension_**); and

     * (d) the person's period of Australian working life residence in respect of the second pension is shorter than the period that was the person's period of Australian working life residence for the purposes of calculating the person's initial special needs pension;

    * the person's period of Australian working life residence for the second pension is to be equal to the period of Australian working life residence used in calculating the person's initial pension.

##### Module C--Residence factor

    * Residence factor (period of Australian working life residence 25 years or more)

    * 796C1		If a person's period of Australian working life residence is 300 months (25 years) or more, the person's residence factor i.

         * Note: If a person's residence factor i, the person's overseas pension will be payable overseas at the full domestic rate (less any rent assistance and any and remote area allowance).

    * Residence factor (period of Australian working life residence under 25 years)

    * 796C2		If a person's period of Australian working life residence is less than 300 months (25 years), the person's residence factor is:

    * there is payable to the person as a lump sum an amount worked out using the lump sum calculator at the end of this section.

LUMP SUM CALCULATOR

    * This is how to work out the amount of the lump sum: 

Method statement

       * Step 1.	Work out the amount that would have been payable to the person on the person's payday immediately before the first available bereavement adjustment payday if:

         * (a) the person's partner had not died; and

         * (b) where immediately before the partner's death the couple were an illness separated couple or a respite care couple--they were not such a couple.

       * Step 2.	Work out the amount that would have been payable to the person's partner on the partner's payday or service payday immediately before the first available bereavement adjustment payday if:

         * (a) the partner had not died; and

         * (b) where immediately before the partner's death the couple were an illness separated couple or a respite care couple--they were not such a couple.

       * Step 3.	Add the results of Step 1 and Step 2: the result is called the **_combined rate_**.

       * Step 4.	Work out the amount that, but for subsection 825, would have been payable to the person on the person's payday immediately before the first available bereavement adjustment payday: the result is called the **_person's individual rate_**.

       * Step 5.	Take the person's individual rate away from the combined rate: the result is called the **_partner's instalment component_**.

       * Step 6.	Work out the number of paydays of the partner in the bereavement lump sum period.

       * Step 7.	Multiply the partner's instalment component by the number obtained in Step 6: the result is the amount of the lump sum payable to the person under this section.

LUMP SUM CALCULATOR

    * This is how to work out the amount of the lump sum: 

Method statement

       * Step 1.	Work out the amount that would have been payable to the person on the person's payday immediately after the day on which the person died if:

         * (a) neither the person nor the person's partner had died; and

## Chapter 2B--Student Financial Supplement Scheme

  * Note: Section 19AB contains many of the definitions that are relevant to the provisions of this Chapter.

### Part 2B.1--Establishment of scheme

#### Division 1--Preliminary

##### 1061ZW  Object of this Chapter

    * The object of this Chapter is to establish a Student Financial Supplement Scheme enabling certain tertiary students to obtain a repayable financial supplement by entering into a contract for that purpose with a financial corporation that participates in the scheme.

##### 1061ZX  Outline of the scheme

    * (1) The scheme provides for the reduction of the rate of youth allowance, austudy payment or pensioner education supplement payable to a person who obtains financial supplement.

    * (2) The scheme contains provisions under which the amount of supplement that the person is eligible to obtain depends on the total rate of youth allowance, austudy payment or pensioner education supplement that the person chooses to receive. Those provisions allow the person to choose to repay some or all of the youth allowance, austudy payment or pensioner education supplement, or to receive a lower rate of payment of such an allowance, payment or supplement, in order to receive a higher amount of financial supplement.

    * (3) The scheme provides that the person is not liable to pay interest to the financial corporation in respect of financial supplement received by the person, but provides for payment by the Commonwealth, without cost to the person, to the financial corporation of a subsidy that includes an amount in lieu of interest.

    * (4) The scheme provides for the amount of the financial supplement that has to be repaid under a contract to be indexed on 1 June in the year next following the year in which the contract is entered into, and on 1 June in each later year. The amount by which the supplement is increased by indexation is owed by the person to the Commonwealth and not to the financial corporation.

    * (5) Under the scheme, the person is entitled, but not required, to make early repayments in respect of the supplement during the period of the contract. The scheme provides for a discount for any repayments made before the end of that period.

    * (6) The scheme provides that, if financial supplement paid to a person is not repaid in full before the end of the period of the contract, the obligation to repay the outstanding amount of the supplement is transferred to the Commonwealth, and the indexed amount is repayable by the person to the Commonwealth through the taxation system when the person's income reaches a specified level.

#### Division 2--Eligibility to obtain financial supplement

##### 1061ZY  Eligibility to obtain financial supplement

## Chapter 2C--Assurances of support

### Part 2C.1--Giving assurances

##### 1061ZZGA  What is an assurance of support?

    * In this Chapter: 

    * **_assurance of support_** means an undertaking by a person under this Chapter that the person will pay the Commonwealth an amount equal to the amount of social security payments that are:

     * (a) received in respect of a period by another person who:

       * (i) is identified in the undertaking; and

       * (ii) becomes the holder under the _Migration Act 1958_ of a visa granted in connection with the undertaking (whether or not the person continues to hold the visa throughout the period); and

     * (b) specified in a determination in force under section 1061ZZGH when the payments are received.

         * Note: An assurance of support may relate to social security payments received by 2 or more persons. See paragraph 23(b) of the _Acts Interpretation Act 1901_.

##### 1061ZZGB  Who may give an assurance of support?

    * A person may give an assurance of support only if the requirements specified for the purposes of this section in a determination under section 1061ZZGH are met in relation to the person.

         * Note 1: If a person who does not meet the requirements gives an undertaking purporting to be an assurance of support, the undertaking is not an assurance of support (because it is not under this Chapter) and the Secretary is not required either to accept or to reject the purported assurance.

         * Note 2: This section lets 2 or more persons give an assurance of support if they all meet the requirements specified in a determination under section 1061ZZGH. See paragraph 23(b) of the _Acts Interpretation Act 1901_.

##### 1061ZZGC  How to give an assurance of support

    * (1) A person gives an assurance of support by:

     * (a) delivering the assurance in writing in accordance with a form approved by the Secretary:

       * (i) to a person apparently performing duties at a place approved for the purpose by the Secretary; or

       * (ii) to a person approved for the purpose by the Secretary; or

       * (iii) in a manner, and to a place, approved for the purpose by the Secretary; or

     * (b) giving the assurance in a manner approved by the Secretary for the purposes of this paragraph.

         * Note: If an undertaking purporting to be an assurance of support is given in some other way, the undertaking is not an assurance of support (because it is not under this Chapter) and the Secretary is not required either to accept or to reject the purported assurance.

    * (2) A form approved for the purposes of paragraph (1)(a) may include other undertakings as well as the assurance of support.

    * (3) A place or person approved for the purposes of paragraph (1)(a) may be in or out of .

    * (4) The Secretary's power to approve for the purposes of paragraph (1)(b) is not limited by any other provision of this section.

    * Material to accompany assurance of support

    * (5) When a person is giving an assurance of support, the person must also give the following material in a way in which an assurance of support may be given under subsection (1):

     * (a) information specified in a form approved by the Secretary;

     * (b) documents specified by the Secretary.

    * (6) If the person giving the assurance of support contravenes subsection (5), the assurance is taken not to have been given.

### Part 2C.2--Acceptance of assurances

##### 1061ZZGD  Accepting or rejecting an assurance of support

    * (1) If an assurance of support is given under this Chapter, the Secretary must accept or reject the assurance.

    * Accepting the assurance

    * (2) The Secretary may accept the assurance, but only if:

     * (a) he or she is satisfied that the requirements that are specified for the purposes of this paragraph in a determination under section 1061ZZGH and relate to the person who gave the assurance are met; and

     * (b) the requirements in subsection (3) are met, if the assurance is in respect of:

       * (i) a visa of a kind that can be granted under the _Migration Act 1958_ only if an assurance of support is accepted; and

       * (ii) another person who was at least 18 at the time of the application for the visa;

     * (whether or not the assurance is also in respect of someone else who was under 18 at the time of the application for the visa).

         * Note 1: The Secretary may accept an assurance given by 2 or more persons only if satisfied that the requirements specified in a determination under item 3 of the table in subsection 1061ZZGH(1) and relating to all of them are met. See paragraph 23(b) of the _Acts Interpretation Act 1901_.

         * Note 2: Subparagraph (2)(b)(i) does not apply to a visa of a kind in relation to which there is a discretion to request an assurance of support, because a visa of that kind can be granted without accepting an assurance if one is not requested (even if, in a case in which an assurance is requested, acceptance of the assurance is a condition for the grant of the visa).

    * (3) At least one person who gave the assurance must have given the Secretary a single security for the liability that may be incurred, under section 1061ZZGG in connection with the assurance and a social security payment received by anyone identified in the assurance, by everyone who gave the assurance. The security must:

     * (a) be in a form approved by the Secretary; and

     * (b) be of a value specified for the purposes of this paragraph in a determination under section 1061ZZGH.

    * Rejecting the assurance

    * (4) The Secretary may reject the assurance.

    * (5) The circumstances in which the Secretary may reject the assurance include failure of the person giving the assurance to attend an interview relating to the assurance as requested by the Secretary. This subsection does not limit subsection (4).

##### 1061ZZGE  Notices relating to an assurance of support

    * (1) If the Secretary accepts or rejects an assurance of support, he or she must give written notice of the acceptance or rejection to:

     * (a) the person who gave the assurance; and

     * (b) the Minister administering the _Migration Act 1958_.

    * The notice must name the person in respect of whom the assurance was given.

    * (2) If:

     * (a) the Secretary has accepted an assurance of support given by a person (the **_assurer_**) in respect of another person and a visa; and

     * (b) the Secretary is informed that the other person:

       * (i) is a holder under the _Migration Act 1958_ of the visa; and

       * (ii) has entered the migration zone (as defined in that Act) before, on or after becoming the holder of the visa;

    * the Secretary must give the assurer written notice of the period for which the assurance is in force in respect of the other person.

         * Note: Section 1061ZZGF explains when an assurance of support is in force in respect of the other person.

    * (3) If the assurance of support ceases to be in force in respect of the other person at a time determined by the Secretary under subparagraph 1061ZZGF(1)(b)(ii) or (iii), the Secretary must give the assurer written notice of that fact.

### Part 2C.3--Effect of accepted assurances

##### 1061ZZGEA  Assurance cannot be withdrawn once visa issued

    * A person who has given an assurance of support that has been accepted under this Chapter cannot withdraw that assurance once the person in respect of whom the assurance was given becomes the holder under the _Migration Act 1958_ of a visa granted in connection with the assurance.

##### 1061ZZGF  When an accepted assurance is in force

    * (1) For the purposes of this Act, an assurance of support that has been given in respect of a person identified in the assurance and has been accepted under this Chapter:

     * (a) comes into force in respect of the person at the later of the following times:

       * (i) the time at which the person becomes under the _Migration Act 1958_ the holder of the visa that was granted under that Act in connection with the assurance;

       * (ii) the time at which the person enters the migration zone (as defined in that Act) as the holder of the visa; and

     * (b) remains in force in respect of the person until the earliest of the following times:

       * (i) the end of the period specified for the purposes of this subparagraph in a determination under section 1061ZZGH;

       * (ii) the time (if any) determined by the Secretary under subsection (2);

       * (iii) if a circumstance specified for the purposes of this subparagraph in a determination under section 1061ZZGH applies in relation to the assurance--the time determined by the Secretary in relation to that circumstance.

         * Note: An assurance of support given in respect of 2 or more persons may be in force at different times in respect of each of those persons.

    * (2) The Secretary may determine that the assurance of support ceases to be in force in respect of the person at the time (which may be before the determination is made) another assurance of support comes into force in respect of the person.

    * (3) For the purposes of this Act, an assurance of support (as defined in section 1061ZZGA) is in force in respect of a person only for the period for which it is in force in respect of the person under subsection (1) of this section.

     * (b) a social security payment is received, by another person who is identified in the assurance, in respect of all or part of the period for which the assurance is in force in respect of the other person; and

     * (c) the social security payment is specified for the purposes of this section in a determination in force under section 1061ZZGH when the payment is received.

    * (2) The assurer is liable to pay the Commonwealth the amount of the social security payment.

    * (3) If the assurance was given by more than one person, all of the persons who gave it are jointly and severally liable to pay the Commonwealth the amount of the social security payment.

### Part 2C.4--Determinations

##### 1061ZZGH  Determinations

    * (1) The Minister must, by legislative instrument, make a determination specifying, for the purposes of the provisions mentioned in the table, the things in the table.

         * Note 1: A determination may specify matters and things by reference to classes and may make different provision with respect to different matters or classes of matters. See the _Legislative Instruments Act 2003_.

         * Note 2: The Minister may amend a determination by another legislative instrument. See the _Acts Interpretation Act 1901_.

    * (2) A determination may specify, as a requirement to be met in relation to a person (the **_assurer_**) giving an assurance of support for the Secretary to be permitted by subsection 1061ZZGD(2) to accept the assurance, a requirement that relates to:

     * (a) the members of a couple consisting of the assurer and the assurer's partner; or

     * (b) the assurer's partner.

    * This subsection does not limit the requirements that may be specified under item 3 of the table in subsection (1) of this section.

    * (3) Before making a determination specifying a thing described in item 4 or 5 of the table in subsection (1), the Minister must ask the Minister administering the _Migration Act 1958_ for comments on the things that should be specified and consider the comments (if any) received.

### Part 2C.5--Assurances by unincorporated bodies

##### 1061ZZGI  Application of social security law to unincorporated bodies

    * (1) This Chapter, and the rest of the social security law so far as it relates to this Chapter, apply to an unincorporated body or association (the **_body_**) as if it were a person other than an individual, but they apply with the following changes.

    * Acts of certain persons treated as acts of the body

    * (2) One change is that anything done or omitted by or in relation to:

     * (a) if the body is a partnership--a partner; or

     * (b) in any other case--a member of the committee of management of the body;

    * on behalf of the body is taken to have been done or omitted by the body.

    * Imposition of obligations and liabilities

    * (3) Another change is that obligations, or liabilities under section 1061ZZGG, that would be imposed on the body are imposed instead on:

     * (a) if the body is a partnership--each partner; or

     * (b) in any other case--each member of the committee of management of the body;

    * but they may be discharged by any of the partners or any of those members.

    * The body cannot commit an offence

    * (4) Another change is that if, apart from this subsection, the body would commit an offence, the body does not commit the offence.

         * Example: Subsection (1) applies section 217 of the _Social Security (Administration) Act 1999_ to the body as if it were a person. That section provides that a person who contravenes certain provisions of that Act about false or misleading statements is guilty of an offence. The body does not commit an offence if it contravenes those provisions by making a false or misleading statement.

    * Limit on scope of changes

    * (5) Subsections (2) and (3) do not affect:

     * (a) whether, for the purposes of section 1061ZZGB (about giving an assurance of support), the requirements specified in a determination under section 1061ZZGH are met in relation to the body; or

     * (b) whether, for the purposes of paragraph 1061ZZGD(2)(a) (about accepting an assurance of support), the requirements specified in a determination under section 1061ZZGH are met in relation to the body.

         * Note: Whether the body may give an assurance of support and whether such an assurance may be accepted depend on whether the requirements specified in relation to the body are met, rather than whether requirements relating to a person who is a partner or member of the body's management committee are met in relation to that partner or member.

    * (6) A determination under section 1061ZZGH (applying in accordance with this section) may specify, for the purposes of section 1061ZZGB or paragraph 1061ZZGD(2)(a) (as so applying in relation to the body), a requirement that relates to:

     * (a) one or more of the partners, if the body is a partnership; or

     * (b) some or all of the members of the body or of its committee of management, if the body is not a partnership.

    * This subsection does not limit the requirements relating to the body that may be specified.

## Chapter 3--General provisions relating to payability and rates

### Part 3.1--Rate Calculators (General)

##### 1062  Steps in rate calculation

    * (1) The following are the usual steps in the rate calculation process:

     * (a) start with a maximum basic rate;

     * (b) add any additional amounts that are subject to income or assets testing;

     * (c) apply the income and assets tests;

     * (d) add any additional amounts that are not subject to income or assets testing.

    * (2) The overall rate calculation process is usually described in an early Module of the relevant Rate Calculator.

##### 1063  Standard categories of family situations

    * (1) The Rate Calculators use the following standard categories of family situations:

    * -	not member of a couple;

    * -	member of a couple (or partnered);

    * -	partnered (partner getting neither pension nor benefit);

    * -	partnered (partner getting pension or benefit);

    * -	partnered (partner getting pension);

#### Pension Rate Calculator A

#### Module A--Overall rate calculation process

    * Method of calculating rate

    * 1064A1	The rate of pension is a daily rate. That rate is worked out by dividing the annual rate calculated according to this Rate Calculator by 364 (fortnightly rates are provided for information only).

Method statement

       * Step 1.	Work out the person's **_maximum basic rate_** using MODULE B below.

       * Step 1A.	Work out the amount of pension supplement using Module BA below.

       * Step 1B.	Work out the energy supplement (if any) using Module C below.

       * Step 3.	Work out the amount per year (if any) for rent assistance in accordance with paragraph 1070A(b).

       * Step 4.	Add up the amounts obtained in Step, 1A, 1B and 3: the result is called the **_maximum payment rate_**.

       * Step 5.	Apply the ordinary income test using MODULE E below to work out the income reduction.

             * Note: Module F contains provisions that may apply to working out the ordinary income of a person, and the ordinary income of a partner of the person, for the purposes of disability support pension.

       * Step 8.	Take the income reduction away from the maximum payment rate: the result is called the **_income reduced rate_**.

       * Step 9.	Apply the assets test using MODULE G below to work out the reduction for assets.

       * Step 10.	Take the reduction for assets away from the maximum payment rate: the result is called the**_ assets reduced rate_**.

       * Step 11.	Compare the income reduced rate and the assets reduced rate: the lower of the 2 rates, or the income reduced rate if the rates are equal, is the **_provisional annual payment rate_**.

       * Step 12.	The **_rate of pension_** is the amount obtained by:

         * (a) subtracting from the provisional annual payment rate any special employment advance deduction (see Part 3.16B); and

         * (b) if there is any amount remaining, subtracting from that amount any advance payment deduction (see Part 3.16A); and

         * (c) adding any amount payable by way of remote area allowance (see Module H).

         * Note 1: If a person's assets reduced rate is less than the person's income reduced rate, the person may be able to take advantage of provisions dealing with financial hardship (sections 1129 and 1130).

         * Note 1A: If a person's rate is, or is to be, an income reduced rate or an assets reduced rate, and at least one of those reduced rates is not a nil rate, the person may be able to take advantage of provisions dealing with the pension loans scheme (sections 1133AA to 1144).

         * Note 2: Section 1210 deals with the application of income and assets test reductions.

         * Note 3: The rate calculation for a member of a couple is affected by the operation of point064A2 and 1064A3.

         * Note 4: In some circumstances a person may also be qualified for a pharmaceutical allowance under Part 2.22.

         * Note 5: A person's rate may also be reduced because the person or the person's partner receives compensation (see section 1173) or because the person or the person's partner is receiving a foreign pension (see scheduled international social security agreements at section 1208).

         * Note 7: Clause 146 of Schedule 1A may affect the provisional annual payment rate in step 11.

    * Members of a couple

    * 1064A2	Where 2 people are members of a couple, they will be treated as pooling their resources (income and assets) and sharing them on a 50/50 basis (see points 1064E2 and 1064G2 below). They will also be treated as sharing expenses (e.g. for rent) on a 50/50 basis (see section 1070V).

#### Module B--Maximum basic rate

    * Maximum basic rate

    * 1064B1	A person's maximum basic rate depends on the person's family situation. Work out which family situation in Table B applies to the person. The maximum basic rate is the corresponding amount in column 3.

         * Note 1: For **_member of couple_**, **_partnered_**, **_illness separated couple_**, **_respite care couple_** and **_partnered (partner in gaol)_** see section 4.

         * Note 2: The maximum basic rates are adjusted 6 monthly: see sections 1191 to 1198A.

#### Module BA--Pension supplement

    * Pension supplement

#### Module E--Ordinary income test

    * Effect of income on maximum payment rate

    * 1064E1	This is how to work out the effect of a person's ordinary income on the person's maximum payment rate:

Method statement

       * Step 1.	Work out the amount of the person's ordinary income on a yearly basis.

             * Note 1: For the treatment of the ordinary income of members of a couple see point 1064E2.

             * Note 2: Module F contains provisions that may apply to working out the ordinary income of a person, and the ordinary income of a partner of the person, for the purposes of disability support pension.

       * Step 2.	Work out the person's ordinary income free area (see point 1064E4 below).

             * Note: A person's ordinary income free area is the amount of ordinary income that the person can have without any deduction being made from the person's maximum payment rate.

       * Step 3.	Work out whether the person's ordinary income exceeds the person's ordinary income free area.

       * Step 4.	If the person's ordinary income does not exceed the person's ordinary income free area, the person's ordinary income excess is nil.

       * Step 5.	If the person's ordinary income exceeds the person's ordinary income free area, the person's ordinary income excess is the person's ordinary income less the person's ordinary income free area.

       * Step 6.	Use the person's ordinary income excess to work out the person's reduction for ordinary income using point064E10 to 1064E12 below.

         * Note 1: See point 1064A1 (Steps 5 to 8) for the significance of the person's reduction for ordinary income.

         * Note 2: The application of the ordinary income test is affected by provisions concerning:

the general concept of ordinary income (sections 1072 and 1073);

the work bonus (section 1073AA);

business income (sections 1074 and 1075);

income from financial assets (including income streams (short term) and certain income streams (long term)) (Division 1B of Part 3.10);

income from income streams not covered by Division 1B of Part 3.10 (Division 1C of Part 3.10);

disposal of income (sections 1106 to 1111).

    * Ordinary incomes of members of couples

    * 1064E2	If a person is a member of a couple, add the couple's ordinary incomes (on a yearly basis) and divide by 2 to work out the amount of the person's ordinary income for the purposes of this Module.

         * Note: For the purposes of working out a person's disability support pension rate under this Rate Calculator, Module F applies to working out the ordinary incomes of both members of the couple.

    * Payment of arrears of periodic compensation payments

    * 1064E3	If: 

     * (a) at the time of an event that gives rise to an entitlement of a person to compensation, the person is receiving age pension, disability support pension, wife pension, carer pension, mature age allowance under Part 2.12A or mature age partner allowance; and

     * (b) in relation to that entitlement, the person receives a payment of arrears of periodic compensation;

    * the person is taken to receive on each day in the periodic payments period an amount calculated by dividing the amount received by the number of days in the periodic payments period.

         * Note: For **_periodic payments period_** see section 17.

    * How to calculate a person's ordinary income free area

    * 1064E4	A person's ordinary income free area is worked out using Table E1. Work out which family situation in Table E1 applies to the person. The ordinary income free area is the corresponding amount in column 3.

         * Note 1: For **_member of a couple_**, **_partnered (partner getting neither pension nor benefit)_**, **_partnered (partner getting benefit)_** and **_partnered (partner getting pension)_** see section 4.

         * Note 3: Items 2, 3 and 4 of Table E1 apply to members of illness separated and respite care couples.

         * Note 4: The basic free area limits are indexed annually in line with CPI increases (see sections 1191 to 1194).

    * Pension reduction for ordinary income in excess of ordinary income free area

    * 1064E10	A person's reduction for ordinary income is:

    * Ordinary income excess

    * 1064E11	A person's ordinary income excess is the person's ordinary income less the person's ordinary income free area.

#### Module F--Ordinary income for the purposes of disability support pension

    * Application of this Module

#### Module G--Assets test

    * Effect of assets on maximum payment rate

    * 1064G1	This is how to work out the effect of a person's assets on the person's maximum payment rate:

Method statement

       * Step 1.	Work out the value of the person's assets.

             * Note 1: For the treatment of the assets of members of a couple see point 1064G2.

             * Note 2: For the assets that are to be disregarded in valuing a person's assets see section 1118.

             * Note 3: For the valuation of an asset that is subject to a charge or encumbrance see section 1121.

       * Step 2.	Work out the person's assets value limit (see point 1064G3 below).

             * Note: A person's assets value limit is the maximum value of assets the person can have without affecting the person's pension rate.

       * Step 3.	Work out whether the value of the person's assets exceeds the person's assets value limit.

       * Step 4.	If the value of the person's assets does not exceed the person's assets value limit, the person's assets excess is nil.

       * Step 5.	If the value of the person's assets exceeds the person's assets value limit, the person's assets excess is the value of the person's assets less the person's assets value limit.

       * Step 6.	Use the person's assets excess to work out the person's reduction for assets using point064G4 to 1064G7 below.

         * Note 1: See point 1064A1 (steps 9 and 10) for the significance of the person's reduction for assets.

    * Value of assets of members of couples

    * 1064G2	For the purposes of this Module: 

     * (a) the value of the assets of a member of a couple is to be taken to be 50% of the sum of:

       * (i) the value of the person's assets; and

       * (ii) the value of the person's partner's assets; and

     * (b) the value of the assets of a particular kind of a member of a couple is to be taken to be 50% of the sum of:

       * (i) the value of the person's assets of that kind; and

       * (ii) the value of the person's partner's assets of that kind.

    * Assets value limit

    * 1064G3	A person's assets value limit is worked out using Table G1. Work out the person's family situation and home ownership situation. The assets value limit is the corresponding amount in column 3.

         * Note 1: For **_member of a couple_**, **_partnered (partner getting neither pension nor benefit)_** and **_partnered (partner getting pension or benefit)_** see section 4.

         * Note 2: For **_homeowner_** see section 11.

         * Note 3: Items 2 and 3 apply to members of illness separated and respite care couples.

         * Note 4: The assets value limits are indexed or adjusted annually in line with CPI increases (see sections 1191 to 1194 and 1203).

    * Pension reduction for assets in excess of assets value limit

    * 1064G4	A person's reduction for assets is worked out using Table G2. Work out which family situation applies to the person. The reduction for assets is the amount per year worked out using the corresponding calculation in column 3.

         * Note 1: For **_member of a couple_**, **_partnered (partner getting neither pension nor benefit)_**, **_partnered (partner getting benefit)_** and **_partnered (partner getting pension)_** see section 4.

         * Note 4: For **_assets excess_** see point 1064G5 below.

    * Assets excess

    * 1064G5	A person's **_assets excess_** is the value of the person's assets less the person's assets value limit.

    * 1064G7	In calculating a person's assets excess under point 1064G5 disregard any part of the excess that is not a multiple of $250.

#### Module H--Remote area allowance

    * Remote area allowance

    * 1064H1	An amount by way of remote area allowance is to be added to a person's rate of pension if:

     * (aa) either:

       * (i) the person's rate of pension apart from this point is greater than nil; or

       * (ii) apart from this point, the person's rate of pension would be nil merely because an election by the person under subsection 1061VA(1) is in force; and

     * (a) the person's usual place of residence is situated in the remote area; and

     * (b) the person is physically present in the remote area.

         * Note: For **_remote area_** and **_physically present in the remote area_** see section 14.

    * Rate of remote area allowance

    * 1064H2	The rate of remote area allowance payable to a person is worked out using Table H. Work out which family situation in the Table applies to the person. The rate of remote area allowance is the corresponding amount in column 3 plus an additional corresponding amount in column 5 for each FTB child, and each regular care child, of the person.

         * Note: For **_member of couple_**, **_partnered_**, **_illness separated couple_**, **_respite care couple_** and **_partnered (partner in gaol)_** see section 4.

    * Special rule where partner has an FTB or regular care child but is not receiving a pension

    * 1064H5	If: 

     * (a) a person who is a member of a couple is qualified for an amount by way of remote area allowance; and

     * (b) the person's partner is not receiving a pension or benefit; and

     * (c) the person's partner has an FTB child or a regular care child;

    * the child is taken, for the purposes of this Module, to be an FTB child, or a regular care child, (as the case requires) of the person.

    * Special rule where partner has an FTB or regular care child but is not receiving additional allowance for the child

    * 1064H6	If: 

     * (a) a person who is a member of a couple is qualified for an amount by way of remote area allowance; and

#### Pension Rate Calculator B

#### Module A--Overall rate calculation process

    * Method of calculating rate

    * 1065A1	The rate of pension is a daily rate. That rate is worked out by dividing the annual rate calculated according to this Rate Calculator by 364 (fortnightly rates are provided for information only).

Method statement

       * Step 1.	Work out what would be the person's rate of pension if Pension Rate Calculator A applied to the person: the result is called the **_notional income/assets tested rate_**.

       * Step 2.	Work out the person's **_maximum basic rate_** using MODULE B below.

       * Step 2A.	Work out the amount of pension supplement using Module BA below.

       * Step 3.	Work out the energy supplement (if any) using Module C below.

       * Step 4.	Add up the amounts obtained in Steps 2, 2A and 3: the result is called the **_maximum payment rate_**.

       * Step 5.	Work out the **_nonincome/assets tested rate_** by:

         * (a) subtracting from the maximum payment rate any special employment advance deduction (see Part 3.16B); and

         * (b) if there is any amount remaining, subtracting from that amount any advance payment deduction (see Part 3.16A); and

         * (c) adding any amount payable by way of remote area allowance (see Module E).

       * Step 6.	Compare the notional income/assets tested rate and the nonincome/assets tested rate: whichever is the greater is the person's **_rate of pension_**.

         * Note 1: The person will also be qualified for a pharmaceutical allowance under Part 2.22.

#### Pension Rate Calculator C

#### Module A--Overall rate calculation process

    * Method of calculating rate

    * 1066A1	The rate of pension is a daily rate. That rate is worked out by dividing the annual rate calculated according to this Rate Calculator by 364 (fortnightly rates are provided for information only).

Method statement

       * Step 1.	Work out the person's **_maximum basic rate_** using MODULE B below.

       * Step 1A.	Work out the amount of pension supplement using Module BA below.

       * Step 2.	Work out the energy supplement (if any) using Module C below.

       * Step 3.	Work out the amount per year (if any) for rent assistance in accordance with paragraph 1070A(b).

       * Step 4.	Add up the amounts obtained in Step, 1A, 2 and 3: the result is called the **_maximum payment rate_**.

       * Step 5.	Apply the ordinary income test using MODULE E below to work out the income reduction.

       * Step 8.	Take the income reduction away from the maximum payment rate: the result is called the **_income reduced rate_**.

       * Step 9.	Apply the assets test using MODULE G below to work out the reduction for assets.

       * Step 10.	Take the reduction for assets away from the maximum payment rate: the result is called the **_assets reduced rate_**.

       * Step 11.	Compare the income reduced rate and the assets reduced rate: the lower of the 2 rates, or the income reduced rate if the rates are equal, is the **_provisional annual payment rate_**.

       * Step 12.	The **_rate of pension_** is the amount obtained by:

         * (a) subtracting from the provisional annual payment rate any special employment advance deduction (see Part 3.16B); and

         * (b) if there is any amount remaining, subtracting from that amount any advance payment deduction (see Part 3.16A); and

         * (c) adding any amount payable by way of remote area allowance (see Module H).

         * Note 1: If a person's assets reduced rate is less than the person's income reduced rate, the person may be able to take advantage of provisions dealing with financial hardship (sections 1129 and 1130).

         * Note 1A: If a person's rate is, or is to be, an income reduced rate or an assets reduced rate, and at least one of those reduced rates is not a nil rate, the person may be able to take advantage of provisions dealing with the pension loans scheme (sections 1133AA to 1144).

         * Note 2: Section 1210 deals with the application of income and assets test reductions.

         * Note 3: Although most of the categories of person whose rate is to be worked out using this Rate Calculator will not be members of a couple, some categories are persons who are members of a couple (see subparagraphs 249(1)(a)(ii) and (iii)).

         * Note 4: In some circumstances a person may also be qualified for a pharmaceutical allowance under Part 2.22.

         * Note 6: Clause 146 of Schedule 1A may affect the provisional annual payment rate in step 11.

    * Members of a couple

    * 1066A2	If 2 people are members of a couple, they will be treated as pooling their resources (income and assets) and sharing them on a 50/50 basis (see point066E2, 1066F2 and 1066G2).

#### Module B--Maximum basic rate

    * Maximum basic rate

     * (d) otherwise--the amount worked out under point 1066BA3.

    * Residents in Australia etc.--no election in force

    * 1066BA3	The person's pension supplement amount is the amount worked out by:

     * (a) applying the applicable percentage in the following table to the combined couple rate of pension supplement; and

     * (b) if:

       * (i) the person is not partnered; and

       * (ii) the amount resulting from paragraph (a) is not a multiple of $2.60;

     * rounding the amount up or down to the nearest multiple of $2.60 (rounding up if the amount is not a multiple of $2.60 but is a multiple of $1.30).

#### Module E--Ordinary income test

    * Effect of income on maximum payment rate

    * 1066E1	This is how to work out the effect of a person's ordinary income on the person's maximum payment rate:

Method statement

       * Step 1.	Work out the amount of the person's ordinary income on a yearly basis.

             * Note: For the treatment of the ordinary income of members of a couple see point 1066E2.

       * Step 2.	Work out the person's ordinary income free area (see point 1066E4 below).

             * Note: A person's ordinary income free area is the amount of ordinary income that the person can have without any deduction being made from the person's maximum payment rate.

       * Step 3.	Work out whether the person's ordinary income exceeds the person's ordinary income free area.

       * Step 4.	If the person's ordinary income does not exceed the person's ordinary income free area, the person's ordinary income excess is nil.

       * Step 5.	If the person's ordinary income exceeds the person's ordinary income free area, the person's ordinary income excess is the person's ordinary income less the person's ordinary income free area.

       * Step 6.	Use the person's ordinary income excess to work out the person's reduction for ordinary income using point066E8 to 1066E9 below.

         * Note 1: See point 1066A1 (Steps 5 to 8) for the significance of the person's reduction for ordinary income.

         * Note 2: The application of the ordinary income test is affected by provisions concerning:

the general concept of ordinary income (sections 1072 and 1073);

the work bonus (section 1073AA);

business income (sections 1074 and 1075);

income from financial assets (including income streams (short term) and certain income streams (long term)) (Division 1B of Part 3.10);

income from income streams not covered by Division 1B of Part 3.10 (Division 1C of Part 3.10);

disposal of income (sections 1106 to 1111).

    * Ordinary incomes of members of couples

    * 1066E2	If a person is a member of a couple, add the couple's ordinary incomes (on a yearly basis) and divide by 2 to work out the amount of the person's ordinary income for the purposes of this Module.

    * How to calculate a person's ordinary income free area

    * 1066E4	A person's ordinary income free area is worked out using Table E. The ordinary income free area is the amount in column 1.

         * Note: The basic free area per year is indexed annually in line with CPI increases (see sections 1191 to 1194).

    * Reduction for ordinary income

    * 1066E8	A person's reduction for ordinary income is:

    * Ordinary income excess

    * 1066E9	A person's ordinary income excess is the person's ordinary income less the person's ordinary income free area.

#### Module G--Assets test

    * Effect of assets on maximum payment rate

    * 1066G1	This is how to work out the effect of a person's assets on the person's maximum payment rate:

Method statement

             * Note 1: For the treatment of the assets of members of a couple see point 1066G2.

             * Note 2: For the assets that are to be disregarded in valuing a person's assets see section 1118.

             * Note 3: For the valuation of an asset that is subject to a charge or encumbrance see section 1121.

       * Step 2.	Work out the person's assets value limit (see point 1066G3 below).

             * Note: A person's assets value limit is the maximum value of assets the person can have without affecting the person's pension rate.

       * Step 3.	Work out whether the value of the person's assets exceeds the person's assets value limit.

       * Step 4.	If the value of the person's assets does not exceed the person's assets value limit, the person's assets excess is nil.

       * Step 5.	If the value of the person's assets exceeds the person's assets value limit, the person's assets excess is the value of the person's assets less the person's assets value limit.

       * Step 6.	Use the person's assets excess to work out the person's reduction for assets using point066G4 to 1066G6 below.

         * Note 1: See point 1066A1 (Steps 9 and 10) for the significance of the person's reduction for assets.

       * (ii) the value of the person's partner's assets; and

     * (b) the value of the assets of a particular kind of a member of a couple is to be taken to be 50% of the sum of:

       * (i) the value of the person's assets of that kind; and

       * (ii) the value of the person's partner's assets of that kind.

    * Assets value limit

    * 1066G3	A person's assets value limit is worked out using Table G. Work out which family situation applies to the person. The assets value limit is the corresponding amount in column 3.

         * Note 1: For **_member of a couple_**, **_partnered (partner getting neither pension nor benefit)_** and **_partnered (partner getting pension or benefit)_** see section 4.

         * Note 2: For **_homeowner_** see section 11.

    * Pension reduction for assets in excess of assets value limit

    * 1066G4	A person's reduction for assets is:

    * Assets excess

    * 1066G5	A person's assets excess is the value of the person's assets less the person's assets value limit.

    * 1066G6	In calculating a person's assets excess under point066G4 and 1066G5 disregard any part of that excess which is not a multiple of $250.

       * Step 9.	Take the income reduction away from the maximum payment rate: the result is called the **_income reduced rate_**.

       * Step 10.	Apply the assets test using MODULE H below to work out the reduction for assets.

       * Step 11.	Take the reduction for assets away from the maximum payment rate: the result is called the **_assets reduced rate_**.

       * Step 12.	Compare the income reduced rate and the assets reduced rate: the lower of the 2 rates, or the income reduced rate if the rates are equal, is the **_provisional annual payment rate_**.

       * Step 13.	The **_rate of pension_** is the amount obtained by:

         * (a) subtracting from the provisional annual payment rate any special employment advance deduction (see Part 3.16B); and

         * (b) if there is any amount remaining, subtracting from that amount any advance payment deduction (see Part 3.16A); and

         * (c) adding any amount payable by way of remote area allowance (see Module I).

         * Note 1: If a person's assets reduced rate is less than the person's income reduced rate, the person may be able to take advantage of provisions dealing with financial hardship (sections 1129 and 1130).

         * Note 2: Section 1210 deals with the application of income and assets test reductions.

         * Note 3: The rate calculation for a member of a couple is affected by the operation of point 1066AA2.

    * Members of a couple

    * 1066AA2	Where 2 people are members of a couple, they will be treated as pooling their resources (income and assets) and sharing them on a 50/50 basis (see point066AF2, 1066AG3 and 1066AH2 below). They will also be treated as sharing expenses (e.g. for rent) on a 50/50 basis (see section 1070V).

#### Module B--Maximum basic rate

    * Maximum basic rate

    * 1066AB1	A person's maximum basic rate is to be worked out using Table B. Work out the family situation. The maximum basic rate is the corresponding amount in column 3.

#### Module F--Ordinary income test

    * Effect of income on maximum payment rate

    * 1066AF1	This is how to work out the effect of a person's ordinary income on the person's maximum payment rate:

Method statement

       * Step 1.	Work out the amount of the person's ordinary income on a yearly basis.

             * Note 1: For the treatment of the ordinary income of members of a couple see point 1066AF2.

             * Note 2: Module G contains provisions that may apply to working out, under this Rate Calculator, the ordinary income of a person, and the ordinary income of a partner of the person.

       * Step 2.	Work out the person's ordinary income free area (see point 1066AF3 below).

             * Note: A person's ordinary income free area is the amount of ordinary income that the person can have without any deduction being made from the person's maximum payment.

       * Step 3.	Work out whether the person's ordinary income exceeds the person's ordinary income free area.

       * Step 4.	If the person's ordinary income does not exceed the person's ordinary income free area, the person's ordinary income excess is nil.

       * Step 5.	If the person's ordinary income exceeds the person's ordinary income free area, the person's ordinary income excess is the person's ordinary income less the person's ordinary income free area.

       * Step 6.	Use the person's ordinary income excess to work out the person's reduction for ordinary income using point066AF9 to 1066AF11 below.

         * Note 1: See point 1066AA1 (Steps 6 to 9) for the significance of the person's reduction for ordinary income.

         * Note 2: The application of the ordinary income test is affected by provisions concerning:

disposal of income (sections 1106 to 1111).

    * Ordinary incomes of members of couples

    * 1066AF2	If a person is a member of a couple, add the couple's ordinary incomes (on a yearly basis) and divide by 2 to work out the amount of the person's ordinary income for the purposes of this Module.

    * Payment of arrears of periodic compensation payments

    * 1066AF2A	If: 

     * (a) at the time of an event that gives rise to an entitlement of a person to compensation, the person is receiving disability support pension; and

     * (b) in relation to that entitlement, the person receives a payment of arrears of periodic compensation;

    * the person is taken to receive on each day in the periodic payments period an amount calculated by dividing the amount received by the number of days in the periodic payments period.

         * Note: For **_periodic payments period_** see section 17.

    * How to calculate a person's ordinary income free area

    * 1066AF3	A person's ordinary income free area is worked out using Table F1. Work out which family situation in Table F1 applies to the person. The ordinary income free area is the corresponding amount in column 3.

         * Note 1: For **_member of a couple_**, **_partnered (partner getting neither pension nor benefit)_**, **_partnered (partner getting benefit)_** and **_partnered (partner getting pension)_** see section 4.

    * Pension reduction for ordinary income in excess of ordinary income free area

    * 1066AF9	A person's reduction for ordinary income is:

    * Ordinary income excess

    * 1066AF10	A person's **_ordinary income excess_** is the person's ordinary income less the person's ordinary income free area.

             * Note 1: For the treatment of the assets of members of a couple see point 1066AH2.

             * Note 2: For the assets that are to be disregarded in valuing a person's assets see section 1118.

             * Note 3: For the valuation of an asset that is subject to a charge or encumbrance see section 1121.

       * Step 2.	Work out the person's assets value limit (see point 1066AH3 below).

             * Note: A person's assets value limit is the maximum value of assets the person can have without affecting the person's pension rate.

       * Step 3.	Work out whether the value of the person's assets exceeds the person's assets value limit.

       * Step 4.	If the value of the person's assets does not exceed the person's assets value limit, the person's assets excess is nil.

       * Step 5.	If the value of the person's assets exceeds the person's assets value limit, the person's assets excess is the value of the person's assets less the person's assets value limit.

       * Step 6.	Use the person's assets excess to work out the person's reduction for assets using point066AH4 to 1066AH7 below.

         * Note 1: See point 1066AA1 Step0 and 11 for the significance of the person's reduction for assets.

       * (ii) the value of the person's partner's assets; and

     * (b) the value of the assets of a particular kind of a member of a couple is to be taken to be 50% of the sum of:

       * (i) the value of the person's assets of that kind; and

       * (ii) the value of the person's partner's assets of that kind.

    * Assets value limit

    * 1066AH3	A person's assets value limit is worked out using Table H1. Work out the person's family situation and home ownership situation. The assets value limit is the corresponding amount in column 3.

         * Note 3: For **_assets excess_** see point 1066AH5 below.

    * Assets excess

    * 1066AH5	A person's **_assets excess_** is the value of the person's assets less the person's assets value limit.

    * 1066AH7	In calculating a person's assets excess under point 1066AH5 disregard any part of the excess that is not a multiple of $250.

#### Module I--Remote area allowance

    * Remote area allowance

    * 1066AI1	An amount by way of remote area allowance is to be added to a person's rate of pension if:

     * (aa) either:

       * (i) the person's rate of pension apart from this point is greater than nil; or

       * (ii) apart from this point, the person's rate of pension would be nil merely because an advance pharmaceutical allowance has been paid to the person under Part 2.23 of this Act; and

     * (a) the person's usual place of residence is situated in the remote area; and

     * (b) the person is physically present in the remote area.

#### Pension Rate Calculator E

#### Module A--Overall rate calculation process

    * Method of calculating rate

    * 1066BA1	The rate of pension is a daily rate. That rate is worked out by dividing the annual rate calculated according to this Rate Calculator by 364 (fortnightly rates are provided for information only).

Method statement

       * Step 1.	Work out what would be the person's rate of pension if Pension Rate Calculator D applied to the person: the result is called the **_notional income/assets tested rate_**.

       * Step 2.	Work out the person's **_maximum basic rate_** using MODULE B below.

       * Step 2A.	Work out the energy supplement (if any) using Module BA below.

       * Step 3.	Work out the amount per year for youth disability supplement using MODULE C below.

       * Step 4.	Work out the amount per year (if any) of pharmaceutical allowance using MODULE D below.

       * Step 5.	Add up the amounts obtained in Steps 2, 2A, 3 and 4: the result is called the **_maximum payment rate_**.

       * Step 6.	Work out the **_nonincome/assets tested rate_** by:

         * (a) subtracting from the maximum payment rate any special employment advance deduction (see Part 3.16B); and

         * (b) if there is any amount remaining, subtracting from that amount any advance payment deduction (see Part 3.16A); and

         * (c) adding any amount payable by way of remote area allowance (see Module F).

       * Step 7.	Compare the notional income/assets tested rate and the nonincome/assets tested rate: whichever is the greater is the person's **_rate of pension_**.

         * Note: An amount of remote area allowance is to be added under Step 6 only if the person's rate of pension after Step 5 is greater than nil.

#### Module B--Maximum basic rate

    * Maximum basic rate

    * 1066BB1	A person's maximum basic rate is to be worked out using Table B. Work out the family situation. The maximum basic rate is the corresponding amount in column 3 of the Table.

         * Note 1: For **_member of a couple_**, **_partnered_**, **_illness separated couple_**, **_respite care couple_** and **_partnered (partner in gaol)_** see section 4.

         * Note 2: For **_independent_** see section 5.

         * Note 3: For **_living away from the person's parental home_** see subsection 23(4D).

         * Note 4: The rates in column 3 are adjusted annually in line with CPI changes (see section 1198B).

#### Module BA--Energy supplement

    * 1066BBA1	An energy supplement is to be added to the person's maximum basic rate if the person is residing in Australia and:

     * (a) is in Australia; or

     * (b) is temporarily absent from Australia and has been so for a continuous period not exceeding 6 weeks.

    * However, this Module does not apply if quarterly energy supplement is payable to the person.

         * Note: Section 918 may affect the addition of the energy supplement.

    * 1066BBA2	The person's energy supplement is the amount worked out using the following table:

#### Module C--Youth disability supplement

    * Youth disability supplement

    * 1066BC1	An amount by way of youth disability supplement is to be added to a person's rate. The rate of youth disability supplement is $1,557.40 per year ($59.90 per fortnight).

         * Note: The rate of youth disability supplement is adjusted annually in line with CPI increases (see section 1198C).

#### Module D--Pharmaceutical allowance

    * Qualification for pharmaceutical allowance

    * 1066BD1	Subject to point066BD2, 1066BD3, 1066BD4 and 1066BD6, an additional amount by way of pharmaceutical allowance is to be added to a person's maximum basic rate if the person is an Australian resident.

    * No pharmaceutical allowance if person receiving veterans supplement or MRCA supplement

    * 1066BD2	Pharmaceutical allowance is not to be added to a person's maximum basic rate if the person is receiving:

     * (a) veterans supplement under section 118A of the Veterans' Entitlements Act; or

     * (b) MRCA supplement under section 300 of the Military Rehabilitation and Compensation Act.

    * No pharmaceutical allowance if partner receiving veterans supplement or MRCA supplement and not a service pensioner

     * (a) the person is a member of a couple; and

     * (b) the person's partner is receiving:

       * (i) veterans supplement under section 118A of the Veterans' Entitlements Act; or

       * (ii) MRCA supplement under section 300 of the Military Rehabilitation and Compensation Act; and

     * (c) the person's partner is not receiving a service pension.

    * No pharmaceutical allowance before advance payment period ends

    * 1066BD5	A person's advance payment period:

     * (a) starts on the day on which the advance pharmaceutical allowance is paid to the person; and

     * (b) ends after the number of paydays worked out using the following formula have passed:

    * where: 

    * **_amount of advance_** is the amount of the advance paid to the person.

    * **_pharmaceutical allowance rate_** is the yearly amount of pharmaceutical allowance which would be added to the person's maximum basic rate in working out the instalment for the day on which the advance is paid if pharmaceutical allowance were to be added to the person's maximum basic rate on that day.

    * No pharmaceutical allowance if annual limit reached

    * 1066BD6	Pharmaceutical allowance is not to be added to a person's maximum basic rate if:

     * (a) the person has received an advance pharmaceutical allowance during the current calendar year; and

     * (b) the total amount paid to the person for that year by way of:

       * (i) pharmaceutical allowance; and

       * (ii) advance pharmaceutical allowance;

    * equals the total amount of pharmaceutical allowance that would have been paid to the person during that year if the person had not received any advance pharmaceutical allowance.

         * Note 1: For the amount **_paid_** to a person by way of pharmaceutical allowance see subsections 19A(2) to (6).

         * Note 2: The annual limit is affected by:

how long during the calendar year the person was on pension or benefit;

the rate of pharmaceutical allowance the person attracts at various times depending on the person's family situation.

    * Amount of pharmaceutical allowance

    * 1066BD8	The amount of pharmaceutical allowance is the amount per year worked out using the following Table:

       * (i) the person's rate of pension apart from this point is greater than nil; or

       * (ii) apart from this point, the person's rate of pension would be nil merely because an advance pharmaceutical allowance has been paid to the person under Part 2.23 of this Act; and

     * (a) the person's usual place of residence is situated in the remote area; and

     * (b) the person is physically present in the remote area.

    * the rate of the person's youth allowance is not to be more than the rate at which the allowance would be payable to the person if the other person were the person's partner.

#### Youth Allowance Rate Calculator

#### Module A--Overall rate calculation process

    * Method of calculating rate

    * 1067GA1	The rate of allowance is a daily rate. That rate is worked out by dividing the fortnightly rate calculated according to this Rate Calculator by 14.

Method statement

       * Step 1.	Work out the person's maximum basic rate using Module B below.

       * Step 1A.	Work out the energy supplement (if any) using Module BA below.

       * Step 2.	Work out the amount a fortnight (if any) of pharmaceutical allowance using Module C below.

       * Step 2A.	Work out the amount per fortnight (if any) for youth disability supplement using Module D below.

       * Step 3.	Work out the applicable amount per fortnight (if any) for rent assistance in accordance with paragraph 1070A(a).

       * Step 4.	Add up the amounts obtained in Step to 3: the result is the **_maximum payment rate_**.

       * Step 8.	If the person is not independent and the parental income test applies to the person (see point067GF2 and 1067GF3 in Module F below), work out the **_reduction for parental income _**using that Module.

       * Step 10.	If the person is not independent and the family actual means test applies to the person (see Module G below), work out the person's **_reduction for actual means_** using that Module.

       * Step 12.	Apply the income test using Module H below to work out the person's income reduction.

       * Step 13.	Take away from the maximum payment rate the greatest of the following that apply:

         * (a) the person's reduction for parental income;

         * (b) the person's reduction for actual means;

         * (c) the person's income reduction.

       * (If a reduction described in paragraph (a) or (b) applies, and is not less than any other reduction that applies, take away from the maximum payment rate the firstmentioned reduction.) The result is the **_provisional fortnightly payment rate_**. If that rate is nil because of the taking away of a reduction described in paragraph (a) or (b) then youth allowance is not payable to the person.

             * Note: If a person's maximum payment rate is reduced under this step, section 1210 sets the order in which the components of that rate are to be reduced.

       * Step 14.	The **_rate of allowance _**is the amount obtained by:

         * (a) subtracting from the provisional fortnightly payment rate any special employment advance deduction (see Part 3.16B); and

         * (b) if there is any amount remaining, subtracting from that amount any advance payment deduction (see Part 3.16A); and

         * (c) except where the person is a CDEP Scheme participant in respect of the whole or a part of the period for which the rate of allowance is being worked out, adding any amount payable by way of remote area allowance (see Module K).

#### Module B--Maximum basic rate

    * Maximum basic rate

    * 1067GB1	The maximum basic rate of a person other than a person who is a CDEP Scheme participant in respect of the whole or a part of the period for which the maximum basic rate is being worked out is to be worked out as follows: 

     * (a) if the person is not independent (see section 1067A) and is not a long term income support student (see section 1067F)--use Table BA;

     * (b) if the person is independent and is not a long term income support student--use Table BB or point 1067GB3A;

     * (c) if the person is a long term income support student--use .

    * The maximum basic rate of a person who is a CDEP Scheme participant in respect of the whole or a part of the period for which the maximum basic rate is being worked out is nil (see section 552C).

    * Person who is not independent

    * 1067GB2	If the person is not independent (see section 1067A) and is not a long term income support student (see section 1067F), work out whether the person:

     * (a) lives at home (see section 1067E); or

     * (b) is required to live away from home (see section 1067D).

    * The person's maximum basic rate is the amount in column 3 of the table that corresponds to the person's situation as described in column 2 of the table.

         * Note: The rates in column 3 are indexed annually in line with CPI increases (see sections 1191-1194).

    * Person who is independent

    * 1067GB3	If the person is independent (see section 1067A) and is not a long term income support student (see section 1067F), work out:

     * (a) whether the person is an accommodated independent person (see section 1067B); and

     * (b) if the person is not an accommodated independent person, whether the person:

       * (i) is in supported State care (see section 1067); or

       * (ii) is in unsupported State care (see section 1067); or

       * (iii) is a member of a couple (see section 4); or

       * (iv) has a dependent child (see subsections 5(2) to (9)).

    * The person's maximum basic rate is the amount in column 3 of the table that corresponds to the person's situation as described in column 2 of the table.

         * Note: The rates in column 3 are indexed annually in line with CPI increases (see sections 1191-1194).

    * Certain children treated as dependent children if in recipient's care for at least minimum period

    * 1067GB3AA	For the purposes of point 1067GB3, the maximum basic rate for a person receiving youth allowance is worked out as if the person had a dependent child if:

     * (a) the person is not undertaking fulltime study and is not a new apprentice; and

     * (b) either:

       * (i) the person is legally responsible (whether alone or jointly with another person) for the daytoday care, welfare and development of a child under 16; or

       * (ii) under a family law order, registered parenting plan or parenting plan that is in force, a child under 16 is supposed to live or spend time with the person; and

     * (c) the child is in the person's care for at least 14% of:

       * (i) the instalment period in relation to which the maximum basic rate is being worked out; or

       * (ii) if the Secretary, under point 1067GB3AB, determines another period for the person for the purposes of this subparagraph--that other period; and

     * (d) none of subsections 5(3), (6) and (7) prevents the child from being a dependent child of the person.

         * Note 1: For **_undertaking fulltime study_** see section 541B.

         * Note 2: For **_new apprentice_**, **_family law order_**, **_registered parenting plan_** and **_parenting plan_** see subsection 23(1).

    * 1067GB3AB	The Secretary may, in writing, determine a period of either 14 days or 28 days for the purposes of subparagraph 1067GB3AA(c)(ii). In making the determination, the Secretary must have regard to the guidelines (if any) determined under point 1067GB3AD.

    * 1067GB3AC	A determination made under point 1067GB3AB is not a legislative instrument.

    * 1067GB3AD	The Secretary may, by legislative instrument, determine guidelines to be complied with when making a determination under point 1067GB3AB.

    * 1067GB3A	Despite point 1067GB3, if a person:

     * (a) is independent (see section 1067A) and is not a long term income support student (see section 1067F); and

     * (b) is not a member of a couple; and

     * (c) has an exemption under section 542FA because of a determination in relation to the person under subsection 542FA(3) or (3A);

    * the person's maximum basic rate is the amount worked out as follows:

    * where: 

    * **_pension PP (Single) maximum basic amount_** is the sum of:

     * (a) the amount that would have been the person's maximum basic rate under Module B of the Pension PP (Single) Rate Calculator if the person was receiving parenting payment; and

     * (b) the amount that would have been the person's pension supplement under Module BA of the Pension PP (Single) Rate Calculator if the person was receiving parenting payment.

         * Note: A person's maximum basic rate under Module B of the Pension PP (Single) Rate Calculator is indexed 6 monthly in line with increases in Male Total Average Weekly Earnings (see section 1195).

    * Long term income support student

    * 1067GB4	If the person is a long term income support student (see section 1067F), work out:

     * (a) whether the person is independent (see section 1067A); and

     * (b) if the person is not independent, whether the person:

       * (i) lives at home (see section 1067E); or

       * (ii) is required to live away from home (see section 1067D); and

     * (c) if the person is independent, whether the person is an accommodated independent person (see section 1067B); and

     * (d) whether the person is a member of a couple (see section 4).

##### Submodule 3--Appropriate tax year

    * Appropriate tax year

    * 1067GF4	Subject to this Submodule, the **_appropriate tax year_** for a youth allowance payment period is the base tax year for that period.

    * Base tax year

    * 1067GF5	The **_base tax year_** for a youth allowance payment period is the tax year that ended on 30 June in the calendar year that came immediately before the calendar year in which the period ends.

         * Example: A youth allowance payment period ends on 25 January 1999--this day occurs in the calendar year 1 January 1999 to 31 December 1999--the calendar year that came immediately before this one is the calendar year 1 January 1998 to 31 December 1998--the base tax year is the tax year that ended on 30 June 1998 (i.e. the year of income that began on 1 July 1997).

    * Change to appropriate tax year because of increase in combined parental income

    * 1067GF6	If a person's combined parental income under Submodule 4 for the tax year following the base tax year exceeds:

     * (a) 125% of the person's combined parental income under that Submodule for the base tax year; and

     * (b) 125% of the person's parental income free area under Submodule 5;

    * the appropriate tax year, for the purpose of applying this Module to the person in respect of a youth allowance payment period that ends after 30 September in a year, is the tax year following the base tax year.

    * Change to appropriate tax year at person's request

    * 1067GF7	If: 

     * (aa) a person's combined parental income for the tax year following the base tax year is substantially less than it was in the base tax year and is likely to continue to be so for 2 years after the later of:

       * (i) 1 January in the tax year following the base tax year; or

       * (ii) the day on which the combined parental income is reduced; and

     * (a) the person requests the Secretary to make a determination under point 1067GF8; and

     * (b) as a result, the Secretary determines under that point that, for the purpose of applying this Module to the person in respect of a youth allowance payment period that ends on or after:

       * (i) the day on which the request is made; or

       * (ii) 1 January in a year;

     * whichever day is later, the appropriate tax year is the tax year following the base tax year;

    * the appropriate tax year, for that purpose, is the tax year following the base tax year.

    * Person may ask Secretary to change appropriate tax year

    * 1067GF8	If: 

     * (a) youth allowance:

       * (i) is not payable to a person because the rate of youth allowance because of this Module is nil; or

       * (ii) is payable at a reduced rate because of this Module; and

    * 1067GF14	A notice setting out an estimate of an income component or an amount described in subpoint 1067GF11(3), for a tax year, of a parent of a person claiming or receiving youth allowance may be given to the Secretary by:

     * (a) the parent; or

     * (b) the person claiming or receiving youth allowance.

    * However, if the parent gives a notice, any notice given, in respect of the same income component or amount and the same tax year, by the person claiming or receiving youth allowance is taken not to be, or not to have been, given.

     * (b) the person's combined parental income (see Submodule 4) for the appropriate tax year exceeds the person's parental income free area (see Submodule 5):

         * Note: Dividing by 130 is equivalent to dividing by 26 (for 26 fortnights in a year) and dividing again by 5 (so that the reduction for parental income is only 20 cents for each dollar of the excess).

    * Person who has parental income in common with someone else

    * 1067GF28	Work out a person's reduction for parental income using the following formula and point 1067GF29 if:

     * (a) would not be payable to the person because the rate of youth allowance is calculated to be nil; or

     * (b) would be calculated to be payable at a reduced rate.

    * (3) The second condition is that the person gives to the Secretary, in writing:

     * (a) evidence, or an estimate, that the amount of the actual means of the person's family for the tax year (the **_following tax year_**) immediately after the base tax year is substantially less than it was in the base tax year:

       * (i) because of a circumstance or event that is beyond the control of the person and the person's family members; or

     * (b) an amount equal to the value so determined is taken to be the amount of the spending.

    * (2) If the Secretary considers that spending by a person other than a family member of a relevant person is spending for the benefit of the relevant person:

         * Note: Dividing by 130 is equivalent to dividing by 26 (for 26 fortnights in a year) and dividing again by 5 (so that the reduction for family actual means is only 20 cents for each dollar of the excess).

    * Person who has parental income in common with someone else

    * 1067GG17	Work out a person's reduction for family actual means using the following formula and point 1067GG18 if:

#### Module H--Income test

    * Effect of ordinary income on maximum payment rate

    * 1067GH1	This is how to work out the effect of a person's ordinary income, and the ordinary income of a partner of the person, on the person's maximum payment rate:

Method statement

       * Step 1.	Work out the amount of the person's ordinary income on a fortnightly basis (where appropriate, taking into account the matters provided for in point067GH2 to 1067GH25).

       * Step 2.	If the person is a member of a couple, work out the partner income free area using point 1067GH26.

             * Note: The partner income free area is the maximum amount of ordinary income the person's partner can have without affecting the person's benefit.

       * Step 3.	Use point 1067GH27 to work out the person's partner income excess. (If there is no partner income excess under that point, the person's partner income excess is taken to be nil.)

       * Step 4.	Use the person's partner income excess to work out the person's partner income reduction using point 1067GH28.

#### Austudy Payment Rate Calculator

#### Module A--Overall rate calculation process

    * Method of calculating rate

    * 1067LA1	The rate of payment is a daily rate. That rate is worked out by dividing the fortnightly rate calculated according to this Rate Calculator by 14.

Method statement

       * Step 1.	Work out the person's maximum basic rate using Module B below.

       * Step 1A.	Work out the pension supplement amount (if any) using Module BA below.

       * Step 1B.	Work out the energy supplement (if any) using Module BB below.

       * Step 2.	Work out the amount a fortnight (if any) of pharmaceutical allowance using Module C below.

       * Step 2A.	Work out the applicable amount per fortnight (if any) for rent assistance in accordance with paragraph 1070A(a).

       * Step 3.	Add up the amounts obtained in Steps 1, 1A, 1B, 2 and 2A: the result is the **_maximum payment rate_**.

       * Step 4.	Apply the income test using Module D below to work out the person's income reduction.

       * Step 5.	Take away the person's income reduction from the maximum payment rate: the result is the **_provisional fortnightly payment rate_**.

             * Note: If a person's rate is reduced under this step, the order in which the reduction is to be made is laid down by section 1210.

       * Step 6.	The **_rate of payment _**is the amount obtained by:

         * (a) subtracting from the provisional fortnightly payment rate any special employment advance deduction (see Part 3.16B); and

         * (b) if there is any amount remaining, subtracting from that amount any advance payment deduction (see Part 3.16A); and

         * (c) adding any amount payable by way of remote area allowance (see Module F).

#### Module B--Maximum basic rate

    * Maximum basic rate

    * 1067LB1	A person's maximum basic rate is to be worked out as follows:

     * (a) if the person is not a long term income support student (see section 1067K)--use Table BA;

     * (b) if the person is a long term income support student--use point 1067LB3.

    * Person who is not a long term income support student

    * 1067LB2(1)	If the person is not a long term income support student (see section 1067K), work out:

     * (a) whether the person is a member of a couple (see section 4); and

     * (b) whether the person has a dependent child (see subsections 5(2) to (9)); and

     * (c) if the person is not a member of a couple, whether the person has a YA child (see subpoint (2)).

    * The person's maximum basic rate is the amount in column 3 of the table that corresponds to the person's situation as described in column 2 of the table.

         * Note: The rates in column 3 are indexed annually in line with CPI increases (see sections 1191-1194).

    * (2) In this point:

    * **_YA child_**, in relation to a person who is not a member of a couple, means a child who is receiving youth allowance, is under 18 years of age and would be a dependent child of the person if he or she were not receiving the allowance.

    * Person who is a long term income support student

    * 1067LB3	If the person is a long term income support student (see section 1067K), work out whether the person is a member of a couple (see section 4).

#### Module E--Student income bank

    * Student income bank

    * 1067LE1	A person's ordinary income under Module D may be reduced under this Module. This diagram sets out how to work out:

     * (a) whether the person's ordinary income for a particular fortnight in respect of which austudy payment may be payable to the person, is to be reduced; and

     * (b) if it is to be reduced, the amount of the reduction.

    * Income bank credit

    * 1067LE2	A person's income bank credit for a particular income bank fortnight of the person is to be worked out as follows:

Method statement

       * Step 1.	Assume that the person's income bank credit, at the time this Module starts applying to the person, is an opening balance of zero.

       * Step 2.	If, for the person's first income bank fortnight, the person has an income credit under point 1067LE3, add it to the opening balance.

       * Step 3.	For each subsequent income bank fortnight of the person, up to but not including the fortnight in question, either:

         * (a) if the person has an income credit for that fortnight under point 1067LE3 and the person is not a new apprentice--add it to the balance of the person's income bank credit in respect of all the previous fortnights, but not so as to increase the balance beyond $10,000; or

         * (aa) if the person has an income credit for that fortnight under point 1067LE3 and the person is a new apprentice--add it to the balance of the person's income bank credit in respect of all the previous fortnights, but not so as to increase the balance beyond $1,000; or

         * (b) if the person has, in respect of that fortnight, drawn from the person's income bank credit under point 1067LE4--deduct from that balance the amount drawn, but not so as to reduce the balance below zero.

       * The result is the person's income bank credit for the fortnight in question.

    * Income credit

    * 1067LE3	For the purposes of point 1067LE2, if the amount that would, apart from this Module, be the person's ordinary income for an income bank fortnight of the person is less than the ordinary income free area (see point 1067LD28):

     * (a) the person has an income credit for that fortnight; and

     * (b) the income credit is an amount equal to the difference between the ordinary income free area (see point 1067LD28) and the firstmentioned amount.

    * Drawing from income bank credit

    * 1067LE4	For the purposes of point 1067LE2, if the amount that would, apart from this Module, be the person's ordinary income for an income bank fortnight of the person is greater than the ordinary income free area (see point 1067LD28):

     * (a) the person is taken to have drawn from the person's income bank credit in respect of that fortnight; and

     * (b) the amount drawn is taken to be an amount equal to the difference between the firstmentioned amount and the ordinary income free area (see point 1067LD28).

     * (b) the person had a working credit balance greater than nil immediately before the date of effect of the determination or cancellation; and

     * (c) the person makes a claim, or is taken to have made a claim, for an austudy payment; and

     * (d) the Secretary determines that the claim is to be granted with effect from a day within 12 months after the date of effect mentioned in paragraph (b); and

     * (e) the person becomes a person to whom this Module applies on a day (the **_module application day_**), being either the day with effect from which the claim is granted or a day following that day; and

     * (f) the person has not reached pension age before the module application day;

    * the working credit balance mentioned in paragraph (b) becomes the opening balance of the income bank credit applicable to the person on the module application day.

    * Opening balance following suspension and subsequent cancellation of another social security pension or benefit

    * 1067LE7	If: 

     * (a) a person ceases to be a working credit participant because of a determination to suspend the person's social security pension or social security benefit; and

     * (g) the person has not reached pension age before the module application day;

    * the working credit balance mentioned in paragraph (c) becomes the opening balance of the income bank credit applicable to the person on the module application day.

#### Module F--Remote area allowance
