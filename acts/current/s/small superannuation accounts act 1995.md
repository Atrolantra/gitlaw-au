### An Act relating to the small superannuation accounts scheme

    * The following is a simplified explanation of this Act: 

     *  	The Australian Taxation Office administers a special account. Notional **accounts** are kept within the special account.

     *  	The account offers employees with small balances an opportunity to avoid the erosion of those balances by fees. 

     *  	Employees may request that account balances be **transferred** to a nominated **superannuation fund **or **RSA**. 

     *  	Except in special cases, employees will not have direct access to their account balances. 

     * ** 	Interest** will be calculated on the daily balance of the account and credited to the account on a quarterly basis. 

     *  	Interest is **exempt from income tax**. 

     *  	If an account balance exceeds $1,200, interest will **only** be credited on the **first $1,200** of the balance. This is an incentive for employees to request that balances of more than $1,200 be transferred to a superannuation fund.

    *  The following is a simplified outline of this Part: 

     *  	Interest is funded by crediting amounts to the Special Account.

     *  	Interest accrues to an account on the daily balance of the account. Interest only accrues on the first $1,200 of the balance of the account.

     *  	Interest is credited each quarter on the allocation day.

     *  	The allocation day is published in the _Gazette_.

     *  	The rate at which interest accrues is called the allocation rate.

     *  	The allocation rate is published in the _Gazette_.

     *  	Interest will not accrue to an account in the following cases: 

         * (a) a deposit is refunded;

         * (b) a shortfall component is incorrectly credited to the account;

         * (c) the $1,200 limit has been avoided by the use of multiple accounts.

#### Division 2--Gross interest amount and net interest amount

##### 37  Simplified outline

    *  The following is a simplified outline of this Division: 

     *  	The expressions **gross interest amount** and **net interest amount** are defined. 

     *  	 Those expressions are used to work out: 

       * (a) how interest is funded; and 

       * (b) the rate at which interest accrues to an account. 

##### 38  Gross interest amount

    * For the purposes of this Part, the **_gross interest amount_** for a quarter is the sum of the following amounts:

     * (a) the income derived by the Commonwealth during the quarter from the investment of amounts standing to the credit of the Special Account;

     * (b) the amount (if any) determined by the Finance Minister in relation to the quarter having regard to the amount standing to the credit of the Special Account that remains uninvested from time to time during the quarter.

##### 39  Net interest amount

    * Net interest amount

    * (1) For the purposes of this Part, the **_net interest amount_** for a quarter is the gross interest amount for the quarter, reduced (but not below 0) by the sum of:

     * (a) the amount determined by the Commissioner of Taxation, where the amount represents a fair approximation of the costs incurred by the Commonwealth during the quarter in connection with the administration of this Act; and

     * (b) the amount, or the total of the amounts, allocated to the quarter under subsection (3).

       * Note: **_Gross interest amount_** is defined by section 38.

     * (a) the amount determined under paragraph (1)(a) in relation to a quarter;

    * exceeds: 

     * (b) the gross interest amount for the quarter;

    * the excess is taken to be the carryforward amount for the quarter.

       *  	Note: **_Gross interest amount_** is defined by section 38.

    * Allocation of carryforward amounts

    * (3) For the purposes of this section, the Finance Minister may determine that:

     * (a) a carryforward amount for a quarter is to be allocated to a later quarter; or

     * (b) different parts of the carryforward amount for a quarter are to be allocated to different later quarters.

    * Amortisation

    * (4) For the purposes of this section, capital costs and development costs are to be amortised in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles.

    * Investment costs

    * (5) For the purposes of this section, the costs incurred by the Commonwealth in connection with the investment of amounts standing to the credit of the Special Account are taken to have been incurred in connection with the administration of this Act.

#### Division 3--Funding of interest

##### 40  Simplified outline

    *  The following is a simplified outline of this Division: 

     *  	Interest is funded by crediting the net interest amount to the Special Account.

     *  	An Unallocated Interest Pool is to be kept within the Special Account.

     *  	Unallocated interest is represented by the balance of the Unallocated Interest Pool.

     *  	In special cases, the Unallocated Interest Pool may be supplemented by crediting an amount to the Special Account.

     *  	Since interest only accrues on the first $1,200 of an account balance, it is possible for a surplus to build up in the Unallocated Interest Pool. The surplus can be debited from the Special Account.

##### 41  Crediting of net interest amount to the Special Account

    * As soon as practicable after the end of a quarter, an amount equal to the net interest amount for the quarter is to be credited to the Special Account.

       * Note: **_Net interest amount_** is defined by section 39.

##### 42  Unallocated Interest Pool

    * Pool

    * (1) For accounting purposes, a separate notional subcomponent, called the Unallocated Interest Pool, is to be kept within the Special Account.

    * Credits to Pool

    * (2) An amount credited to the Special Account under section 41 is to be credited to the Unallocated Interest Pool.

    * Debits from Pool

    * (3) The balance of the Unallocated Interest Pool is to be debited for the purposes of crediting interest to an individual's account.

##### 43  Supplementation of Unallocated Interest Pool

    * When section applies

    * (1) This section applies if the Finance Minister is satisfied that:

     * (a) the balance of the Unallocated Interest Pool is nil; or

     * (b) the balance of the Unallocated Interest Pool is, or is likely to be, insufficient to meet the requirements of the Unallocated Interest Pool.

    * Supplementation

    * (2) The Finance Minister may determine that the Unallocated Interest Pool is to be supplemented by a specified amount.

    * Crediting of the supplementation amount

    * (3) The specified amount is to be credited to the Special Account.

    * Credit to Unallocated Interest Pool

    * (4) The Unallocated Interest Pool is to be credited by the specified amount.

##### 44  Debiting of unallocated interest

    * (1) If the Commissioner of Taxation is satisfied that the balance of the Unallocated Interest Pool exceeds the requirements of the Unallocated Interest Pool, the Commissioner of Taxation must determine that the excess is surplus to the requirements of the Unallocated Interest Pool.

    * (2) The Unallocated Interest Pool is to be debited by an amount equal to the excess.

    * (3) An amount equal to the excess is to be debited from the Special Account.

#### Division 4--Allocation day and allocation rate

##### 45  Simplified outline

    * The following is a simplified outline of this Division: 

     *  	The allocation day for a quarter is published in the _Gazette_. The allocation day is the day on which interest is credited to accounts. 

     *  	The allocation rate for a quarter is published in the _Gazette_. The allocation rate is the rate at which interest accrues to an account. 

     *  	The allocation rate is worked out under section 47. 

##### 46  Gazettal of allocation day and allocation rate

    * (1) As soon as practicable after an amount is credited to the Special Account under section 41 in respect of a quarter (the **_current quarter_**), the Commissioner of Taxation must, by notice published in the _Gazette_, declare that, for the purposes of this Part:

     * (a) a specified day in the quarter next following the current quarter is the **_allocation day_** for the current quarter; and

     * (b) a specified percentage is the **_allocation rate_** for the current quarter.

       * Note: To work out the allocation rate see section 47.

    * (2) The declaration has effect accordingly.

##### 47  Calculation of the allocation rate

    * Application of steps

    * (1) To work out the allocation rate for a quarter, apply the following steps.

    * Adjusted total balances

    * (2) Calculate the **_adjusted total balances_** for the quarter by:

     * (a) working out, for each day in the quarter, the total balances of all the accounts; and

     * (b) adding up those totals; and

     * (c) dividing the result by the number of days in the quarter.

    * For the purposes of this calculation, if an account balance actually exceeds $1,200, the account balance is taken to be $1,200.

    * Provisional rate

    * (3) Calculate the **_provisional rate_** for the quarter as a percentage (to 4 decimal places) using the formula: 

    * where: 

    * **_Net interest amount_** means the net interest amount for the quarter;

    * **_Adjusted total balances_** means the adjusted total balances for the quarter.

       * Note: **_Net interest amount_** is defined by section 39.

    * Total balances

    * (4) Calculate the **_total balances_** for the quarter by:

     * (a) working out, for each day in the quarter, the total balances of all the accounts; and

     * (b) adding up those totals; and

     * (c) dividing the result by the number of days in the quarter.

    * Capped rate

    * (5) Calculate the **_capped rate_** as a percentage (to 4 decimal places) using the formula:

    * where: 

    * **_Gross interest amount_** means the gross interest amount for the quarter;

    * **_Total balances_** means the total balances for the quarter.

       * Note: **_Gross interest amount_** is defined by section 38.

    * Allocation rate--comparison between provisional rate and capped rate

    * (6) Compare the provisional rate with the capped rate:

     * (a) if the provisional rate is less than or equal to the capped rate--the allocation rate equals the provisional rate; or

     * (b) if the provisional rate exceeds the capped rate--the allocation rate equals the capped rate.

#### Division 5--Crediting of interest

##### 48  Simplified outline

    *  The following is a simplified outline of this Division: 

     *  	Interest accrues to an account on the daily balance of the account. Interest only accrues on the first $1,200 of the balance of the account. 

     *  	Interest is credited each quarter on the allocation day. 

##### 49  Accrual of interest on first $1,200 of daily balance

    * (1) Interest accrues to an account each day on the balance of the account as at the end of that day.

    * (2) For the purposes of this Division, if an account balance actually exceeds $1,200, the account balance is taken to be $1,200.

##### 50  Rate of accrual, and crediting, of interest

    * When section applies

    * (1) This section applies to interest that accrues under section 49.

    * Allocation day event, withdrawal event and inactive account debit event

    * (2) Both:

     * (a) the rate of accrual of interest to an account in respect of a particular day (the **_accrual day_**) in a particular quarter; and

     * (b) the time at which accrued interest in respect of the accrual day is to be credited to the account;

    * depends on whichever of the following events first happens after the accrual day: 

     * (c) the occurrence of the allocation day for the quarter (this event is to be known as the **_allocation day event_**);

     * (d) the withdrawal under Part 7 of the balance of the account (this event is to be known as the **_withdrawal event_**);

     * (e) the debiting of the balance of the account from the Special Account under Part 9 (this event is to be known as the **_inactive account debit event_**).

    * Allocation day event

    * (3) If the allocation day event comes first:

     * (a) the rate of accrual is the percentage worked out (to 6 decimal places) using the formula:

     * where: 

     * **_Allocation rate_** means the allocation rate for the quarter; and

     * (b) the accrued interest is to be credited to the account on the allocation day.

    * Withdrawal event

    * (4) If the withdrawal event comes first:

     * (a) the rate of accrual is the percentage worked out (to 6 decimal places) using the formula:

     * where: 

     * **_Adjusted allocation rate_** means the last allocation rate that was published in the _Gazette _before the accrual day; and

     * (b) the accrued interest is to be credited to the account on the day before the day of the withdrawal.

    * Inactive account debit event

    * (5) If the inactive account debit event comes first:

     * (a) the rate of accrual is the percentage worked out (to 6 decimal places) using the formula:

     * where: 

     * **_Adjusted allocation rate_** means the last allocation rate that was published in the _Gazette _before the accrual day; and

     * (b) the accrued interest is to be credited to the account on the day of the debit.

    * Transitional--withdrawal event before first allocation day

    * (6) Despite paragraph (4)(a), if the withdrawal event occurs before the allocation day for the quarter beginning on 1 July 1995, that paragraph has effect, in relation to that event, as if the adjusted allocation rate were 0.4% or such higher rate as the Finance Minister determines.

##### 51  Rounding up

    * If the total amount of interest to be credited to an account on a particular day (when expressed as a number of cents) is not a number of whole cents, that total must be rounded up to the nearest cent.

    * (2) If, because of the $1,200 limit referred to in subsection 49(2):

     * (a) the total amount of interest that accrued to the separate accounts before the day of the amalgamation;

    * exceeds: 

     * (b) the total amount of interest that would have accrued to the amalgamated account if it were assumed that the amalgamated account had been in existence at all times since the earliest time at which any of the separate accounts was opened;

    * then, despite section 49, the excess interest is taken never to have accrued under that section.

    * Debit to amalgamated account
