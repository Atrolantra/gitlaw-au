### An Act to build stronger futures for Aboriginal people in the Northern Territory, and for related purposes

### Part 1--Preliminary

#### Division 1--Introduction

##### 1  Short title

    * This Act may be cited as the_ Stronger Futures in the Northern Territory Act 2012_.

##### 2  Commencement

    * (1) Each provision of this Act specified in column 1 of the table commences, or is taken to have commenced, in accordance with column 2 of the table. Any other statement in column 2 has effect according to its terms.

        * Note: This table relates only to the provisions of this Act as originally enacted. It will not be amended to deal with any later amendments of this Act.

    * (2) Any information in column 3 of the table is not part of this Act. Information may be inserted in this column, or information in it may be edited, in any published version of this Act.

##### 3  Guide to this Act

    * This Act contains a number of measures aimed at building stronger futures for Aboriginal people in the Northern Territory.

Part 2--Tackling alcohol abuse

    * The measures in Part 2 are aimed at reducing alcoholrelated harm to those Aboriginal people. Many of the measures apply in alcohol protected areas (which are particular areas of the Northern Territory that are prescribed by the rules (see section 27)).

    * Some of the measures in Part 2 modify the NT Liquor Act, and licences and permits issued under that Act, so that they apply in alcohol protected areas in a particular way. For example, section 8 inserts a number of offences (such as the offence for consuming liquor in an alcohol protected area) into the NT Liquor Act.

    * Part 2 allows the Minister to request the NT Minister to appoint an assessor to conduct an assessment of particular licensed premises in the Northern Territory if the Minister reasonably believes that the sale or consumption of liquor at or from those premises is causing substantial alcoholrelated harm to the community (see section 15).

    * Part 2 also deals with alcohol management plans and provides a process for the approval of those plans by the Minister (see Division 6 of that Part).

Part 3--Land reform

    * Part 3 contains measures relating to town camps and community living areas. Those measures are aimed at facilitating the granting of rights and interests, and promoting economic development, in those camps and areas. Those measures allow regulations to be made to modify particular laws of the Northern Territory to the extent that those laws apply to town camps or community living areas.

Part 4--Food security

    * Part 4 provides for a licensing regime for certain community stores operating in the food security area (which is the whole of the Northern Territory other than an area that is prescribed by the rules (see section 74)). That regime is aimed at promoting food security for Aboriginal communities.

    * The Secretary may determine, at any time, whether the owner of a community store is required to hold a community store licence. If the Secretary determines that the owner is required to hold a licence, then the store will be prohibited from operating in the food security area unless the owner obtains the licence. The Secretary cannot determine that the owner is required to hold a licence unless the Secretary is satisfied that the store is an important source of food, drink or grocery items for an Aboriginal community.

    * If the Secretary grants a licence, the Secretary may impose conditions on the licence. The owner will be required to comply with those conditions, plus the conditions that are imposed by Part 4 and the rules.

Part 5--Other matters

    * Part 5 has a number of miscellaneous provisions. It requires the Minister to cause an independent review to be conducted of the first 3 years of the operation of this Act (see section 117). It provides that this Act sunsets 10 years after commencement (see section 118). It also has other miscellaneous provisions (such as the power to delegate, the power to make rules and the power to make regulations).

##### 4  Object of this Act

    * The object of this Act is to support Aboriginal people in the Northern Territory to live strong, independent lives, where communities, families and children are safe and healthy.

    * This Part contains measures aimed at reducing alcoholrelated harm to Aboriginal people in the Northern Territory. Many of those measures apply in alcohol protected areas (which are particular areas of the Northern Territory that are prescribed by the rules (see section 27)).

    * Division 2 modifies the NT Liquor Act so that it applies in alcohol protected areas in a particular way. For example, section 8 inserts a number of offences into that Act, such as the offence for consuming liquor in an alcohol protected area.

    * Division 3 modifies NT liquor licences and NT liquor permits that are in force in alcohol protected areas. Those modifications affect what the licence or permit authorises. The Division also allows the Minister to vary the conditions of the licence or permit.

    * Division 4 allows the NT Licensing Commission to post a notice, at an access point to an alcohol protected area, notifying people about the alcohol offences that apply in that area.

    * Division 5 provides a mechanism under which the Minister may request the NT Minister to appoint an assessor to conduct an assessment of particular licensed premises in the Northern Territory. The Minister may only make the request if the Minister reasonably believes that the sale or consumption of liquor at or from the premises is causing substantial alcoholrelated harm to the community.

    * Division 6 deals with alcohol management plans. In particular, it provides a process for the approval of alcohol management plans by the Minister.

    * Division 7 deals with the process for making rules prescribing that an area is an alcohol protected area.

    * Division 8 requires the Minister and the NT Minister to cause an independent review to be undertaken of the operation of specified laws of the Commonwealth and the Northern Territory that relate to alcohol. In particular, the review must assess the effectiveness of those laws in reducing alcoholrelated harm to Aboriginal people.

    * Division 9 deals with miscellaneous matters relating to this Part (such as the NT Licensing Commission providing information requested by the Minister and administrative review of certain determinations made under this Part).

##### 7  Object of this Part

    * The object of this Part is to enable special measures to be taken to reduce alcoholrelated harm to Aboriginal people in the Northern Territory.

    * Application for order

    * (1) The Secretary may apply to a relevant court for an order that a person, who is alleged to have contravened a civil penalty provision, pay the Commonwealth a pecuniary penalty.

    * (2) A subsection of this Part (or a section of this Part that is not divided into subsections) is a **_civil penalty provision_** if the words "civil penalty" and one or more amounts in penalty units are set out at the foot of the subsection (or section).

    * (3) The Secretary must make an application under subsection (1) within 6 years of the alleged contravention.

    * Court may order person to pay pecuniary penalty

    * (4) If the relevant court is satisfied that the person has contravened the civil penalty provision, the court may order the person to pay to the Commonwealth such pecuniary penalty for the contravention as the court determines to be appropriate.

        * Note: Subsection (6) sets out the maximum penalty that the court may order the person to pay.

    * (5) An order under subsection (4) is a **_civil penalty order_**.

    * Determining the amount of a pecuniary penalty

    * (6) The pecuniary penalty must not be more than the pecuniary penalty specified for the civil penalty provision.

    * (7) In determining the amount of a pecuniary penalty, the court must take into account all relevant matters, including:

     * (b) the nature and extent of any loss or damage suffered because of the contravention; and

     * (c) the circumstances in which the contravention took place; and

     * (d) whether the person has previously been found by a court to have engaged in any similar conduct.

##### 76  Civil enforcement of penalty

    * (1) A pecuniary penalty is a debt payable to the Commonwealth.

    * (2) The Commonwealth may enforce a civil penalty order as if it were an order made in civil proceedings against the person to recover a debt due by the person. The debt arising from the order is taken to be a judgement debt.

##### 77  Conduct contravening more than one civil penalty provision

    * (1) If conduct constitutes a contravention of 2 or more civil penalty provisions, proceedings may be instituted under this Part against a person in relation to the contravention of any one or more of those provisions.

    * (2) However, the person is not liable to more than one pecuniary penalty under this Part in relation to the same conduct.

##### 78  Multiple contraventions

    * (1) A relevant court may make a single civil penalty order against a person for multiple contraventions of a civil penalty provision if proceedings for the contraventions are founded on the same facts, or if the contraventions form, or are part of, a series of contraventions of the same or a similar character.

        * Note: For continuing contraventions of civil penalty provisions, see section 87.

    * (2) However, the penalty must not exceed the sum of the maximum penalties that could be ordered if a separate penalty were ordered for each of the contraventions.

    * A contravention of a civil penalty provision is not an offence.

##### 82  Civil proceedings after criminal proceedings

    * A relevant court may not make a civil penalty order against a person for a contravention of a civil penalty provision if the person has been convicted of an offence constituted by conduct that is the same, or substantially the same, as the conduct constituting the contravention.

##### 83  Criminal proceedings during civil proceedings

    * (1) Proceedings for a civil penalty order against a person for a contravention of a civil penalty provision are stayed if:

     * (a) criminal proceedings are commenced or have already been commenced against the person for an offence; and

     * (b) the offence is constituted by conduct that is the same, or substantially the same, as the conduct alleged to constitute the contravention.

    * (2) The proceedings for the order (the **_civil proceedings_**) may be resumed if the person is not convicted of the offence. Otherwise:

     * (a) the civil proceedings are dismissed; and

     * _	_(b)	costs must not be awarded in relation to the civil proceedings.

##### 84  Criminal proceedings after civil proceedings

    * Criminal proceedings may be commenced against a person for conduct that is the same, or substantially the same, as conduct that would constitute a contravention of a civil penalty provision regardless of whether a civil penalty order has been made against the person in relation to the contravention.

##### 85  Evidence given in civil proceedings not admissible in criminal proceedings

    * (1) Evidence of information given, or evidence of production of documents by an individual, is not admissible in criminal proceedings against the individual if:

     * (a) the individual previously gave the evidence or produced the documents in proceedings for a civil penalty order against the individual for an alleged contravention of a civil penalty provision (whether or not the order was made); and

     * (b) the conduct alleged to constitute the offence is the same, or substantially the same, as the conduct alleged to constitute the contravention.

    * (2) However, subsection (1) does not apply to criminal proceedings in relation to the falsity of the evidence given by the individual in the proceedings for the civil penalty order.

     * (a) within a particular period; or

##### 88  Mistake of fact

    * (1) A person is not liable to have a civil penalty order made against the person for a contravention of a civil penalty provision if:

     * (a) at or before the time of the conduct constituting the contravention, the person:

      * (i) considered whether or not facts existed; and

      * (ii) was under a mistaken but reasonable belief about those facts; and

     * (b) had those facts existed, the conduct would not have constituted a contravention of the civil penalty provision.

    * (2) For the purposes of subsection (1), a person may be regarded as having considered whether or not facts existed if:

     * (a) the person had considered, on a previous occasion, whether those facts existed in the circumstances surrounding that occasion; and
