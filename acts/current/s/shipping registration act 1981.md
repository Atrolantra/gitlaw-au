##### 61BM  Mistake of fact

    * (1) A person is not liable to have a civil penalty order made against the person for a contravention of a civil penalty provision if:

     * (a) at or before the time of the conduct constituting the contravention, the person:

      * (i) considered whether or not facts existed; and

      * (ii) was under a mistaken but reasonable belief about those facts; and

     * (b) had those facts existed, the conduct would not have constituted a contravention of the civil penalty provision.

    * (2) For the purposes of subsection (1), a person may be regarded as having considered whether or not facts existed if:

     * (a) the person had considered, on a previous occasion, whether those facts existed in the circumstances surrounding that occasion; and

     * (b) the person honestly and reasonably believed that the circumstances surrounding the present occasion were the same, or substantially the same, as those surrounding the previous occasion.

##### 61BN  State of mind

    * (1) In proceedings for a civil penalty order against a person for a contravention of a civil penalty provision (other than because of subsection 61BL(1)), it is not necessary to prove:

     * (c) the person's recklessness; or

     * (d) the person's negligence; or

     * (e) any other state of mind of the person;

    * other than as expressly provided.

    * (2) Subsection (1) does not affect the operation of section 61BM (mistake of fact).

##### 61BO  Civil penalty provisions contravened by employees, agents or officers

    * If an element of a civil penalty provision is done by an employee, agent or officer of a body corporate acting within the actual or apparent scope of his or her employment, or within his or her actual or apparent authority, the element must also be attributed to the body corporate.

##### 61BP  Continuing contraventions of civil penalty provisions

    * (1) If an act or thing is required under a civil penalty provision to be done:

     * (a) within a particular period; or

     * (b) before a particular time;

    * then the obligation to do that act or thing continues until the act or thing is done (even if the period has expired or the time has passed).

    * (2) A person who contravenes a civil penalty provision that requires an act or thing to be done:

     * (a) within a particular period; or

     * (b) before a particular time;

     * (c) the failure or refusal occurs on more than one day; and

     * (d) each contravention is constituted by the failure or refusal on one of those days.
