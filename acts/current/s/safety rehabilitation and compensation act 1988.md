##### 8  Normal weekly earnings

    * (1) For the purposes of this Act, the normal weekly earnings of an employee (other than an employee referred to in subsection (2)) before an injury shall be calculated in relation to the relevant period under the formula:

    * where: 

    * **_NH_** is the average number of hours worked in each week by the employee in his or her employment during the relevant period;

    * **_RP_** is the employee's average hourly ordinary time rate of pay during that period; and

    * **_A_** is the average amount of any allowance payable to the employee in each week in respect of his or her employment during the relevant period, other than an allowance payable in respect of special expenses incurred, or likely to be incurred, by the employee in respect of that employment.

    * (2) Where an employee is required to work overtime on a regular basis, the normal weekly earnings of the employee before an injury shall be the amount calculated in accordance with subsection (1) plus an additional amount calculated in relation to the relevant period under the formula:

    * where: 

    * **_NH_** is the average number of hours of overtime worked in each week by the employee in his or her employment during the relevant period; and

    * **_OR_** is the employee's average hourly overtime rate of pay during that period.

    * (3) Where an employee was, at the date of the injury, employed by the Commonwealth or a licensed corporation in parttime employment or unpaid employment, any earnings of the employee from any other employment shall, for the purposes of this section, be treated as earnings of the employee from his or her employment by the Commonwealth or the licensed corporation.

    * (4) Where, because of the shortness of the relevant period, it is impracticable to calculate the normal weekly earnings of an employee before an injury under subsection (1) or (2), the normal weekly earnings of the employee before the date of injury shall be taken to be the normal weekly earnings before that date of another employee performing comparable work, being normal weekly earnings from employment by the Commonwealth or a licensed corporation and calculated under subsection (1) or (2), as the case requires.

    * (5) Where, because of the shortness of the relevant period, the normal weekly earnings as calculated in relation to the relevant period under subsection (1) or (2) would not fairly represent the weekly rate at which the employee was being paid in respect of his or her employment before the injury, the normal weekly earnings before the date of the injury shall be calculated in relation to such other period as Comcare considers reasonable for the purpose of arriving at an amount that does fairly represent the weekly rate at which the employee was being so paid.

    * (6) Subject to this section, if the minimum amount per week payable to an employee in respect of his or her employment by the Commonwealth or a licensed corporation at the date of the injury is increased, or would have been increased if the employee had continued in that employment, because of:

     * (a) the attainment by the employee of a particular age;

     * (b) the completion by the employee of a particular period of service; or

     * (c) the receipt by the employee of an increase in salary, wages or pay by way of an increment in a range of salary, wages or pay applicable to the employee or to his or her office, position or appointment;

    * the normal weekly earnings of the employee before the injury, as calculated under the preceding subsections, shall be increased by the same percentage as the percentage by which that minimum amount per week is increased, or would have been increased, as the case may be.

    * (7) Subject to this section, if:

     * (a) an employee continues to be employed by the Commonwealth or a licensed corporation after the date of an injury; and

     * (b) the minimum amount per week payable to the employee in respect of that employment is increased because of the promotion of the employee;

    * the normal weekly earnings of the employee before the injury, as calculated under the preceding subsections, shall be increased by the same percentage as the percentage by which that minimum amount per week is increased.

    * (8) Subject to this section, where:

     * (a) the employment of an employee is of a kind referred to in subsection 5(4) or (6) or subsection (3) of this section; and

     * (b) the employee is not receiving earnings from any other employment at the date of the injury;

    * the normal weekly earnings of the employee before the injury shall be an amount determined by Comcare to be the amount per week that the employee would have been able to earn at the date of the injury (including any amount in respect of overtime worked on a regular basis) if he or she had engaged in suitable paid employment.

    * (9) The normal weekly earnings of an employee before the date of the employee's injury, as calculated under the preceding subsections, must, while the employee continues to be employed by the Commonwealth or a licensed corporation, be increased or reduced by the relevant percentage.

    * (9A) For the purposes of subsection (9), **_relevant percentage_** means the same percentage as the percentage of increase or reduction in the minimum amount per week payable in respect of employees included in a class of employees of which the employee was a member at the date of the injury as a result of:

     * (a) the operation of a law of the Commonwealth or of a State or Territory; or

     * (b) the making, alteration or operation of an award, order, determination or industrial agreement or the doing of any other act or thing, under such a law.

    * (9B) The normal weekly earnings of an employee before injury, as calculated under subsections (1) to (8) and as increased or reduced under subsection (9) must, if the employee has ceased, or ceases, to be employed by the Commonwealth or a licensed corporation, be further increased, with effect from each indexation date in relation to that cessation, by reference to the percentage of increase (if any) of an index that is prescribed for the purposes of this subsection over the year ending on the 31 December preceding each such indexation date.

    * (9C) For the purpose of subsection (9B), the **_indexation date_**, in relation to a cessation of employment, is:

     * (a) the 1 July next following:

      * (i) the date on which this Act receives the Royal Assent; or

      * (ii) the date of that cessation of employment;

     * whichever last occurs; and

     * (b) each subsequent 1 July.

    * (9D) For the purpose of subsection (9B), the regulations may specify the manner of calculating the further increase referred to in that subsection by reference to the movement of the index that is prescribed for the purposes of that subsection.

    * (9E) The normal weekly earnings of an employee before an injury, as calculated under the preceding subsections, must, with effect from 1 July in each year, be further increased by the amount under subsection (9F) if, in the 12 months immediately preceding that 1 July:

     * (a) there was no increase in those earnings under subsection (6), (7) or (9); and

     * (b) there was no reduction in those earnings under subsection (9).

    * (9F) If the normal weekly earnings of an employee before an injury must be increased because of subsection (9E), the amount by which they are increased is the percentage of increase (if any) in the index prescribed by the regulations for the purposes of this subsection over the period of 12 months ending on the 31 December immediately before the relevant 1 July.

    * (9G) For the purposes of subsection (9F), the regulations may specify the manner of calculating the further increase mentioned in that subsection by reference to the movement of the index that is prescribed for the purposes of that subsection.

    * (10) If the amount of the normal weekly earnings of an employee before an injury, as calculated under the preceding subsections, would exceed:

     * (a) where the employee continues to be employed by the Commonwealth or a licensed corporation--the amount per week of the earnings that the employee would receive if he or she were not incapacitated for work; or

     * (b) where the employee has ceased to be employed by the Commonwealth or a licensed corporation--whichever is the greater of the following amounts:

      * (i) the amount per week of the earnings that the employee would receive if he or she had continued to be employed by the Commonwealth or the licensed corporation in the employment in which he or she was engaged at the date of the injury;

      * (ii) the amount per week of the earnings that the employee would receive if he or she had continued to be employed by the Commonwealth or the licensed corporation in the employment in which he or she was engaged at the date on which the employment by the Commonwealth or the licensed corporation ceased;

    * the amount so calculated shall be reduced by the amount of the excess.

##### 9  Relevant period

    * (1) For the purposes of calculating the normal weekly earnings of an employee before an injury, a reference in section 8 to the relevant period is, subject to this section, a reference to the latest period of 2 weeks before the date of the injury during which the employee was continuously employed by the Commonwealth or a licensed corporation.

    * (2) Subject to subsection (3), if, during the period referred to in subsection (1), the minimum amount per week payable to an employee in respect of his or her employment by the Commonwealth or a licensed corporation was varied as a result of:

     * (a) the operation of a law of the Commonwealth or of a State or Territory; or

     * (b) the making, alteration or operation of an award, order, determination or industrial agreement, or the doing of any other act or thing, under such a law;

    * any part of that period that occurred before the variation, or last variation, took place shall be disregarded for the purposes of calculating the relevant period.

    * (3) Where in any case the application of subsection (2) would require that a period be disregarded for the purposes of calculating the relevant period in relation to an employee, and as a result of disregarding that period:

     * (a) it would be impracticable to calculate under section 8 the normal weekly earnings of the employee before an injury; or

     * (b) the normal weekly earnings as so calculated would not fairly represent the weekly rate at which the employee was being paid in respect of his or her employment by the Commonwealth or a licensed corporation before the injury;

    * subsection (2) shall not apply in that case, but the normal weekly earnings of the employee during that period shall be taken to be the amount that would have been his or her normal weekly earnings during that period if the variation had taken effect at the beginning of that period.

    * (4) If, during any part of the period calculated under the preceding subsections, the employee's earnings were reduced, or the employee did not receive any earnings, because of absence from his or her employment for any reason, that part of that period shall be disregarded for the purposes of calculating the relevant period.

    * (3) The Commission may determine, as part of the scope of the licence, that the licensee may accept such liability in respect of such injury, loss, damage or death occurring at a time before the licence came into force.

##### 108A  The consequences of a licensee's authorisation to accept liability

    * (1) If:

     * (a) a licensee is authorised to accept liability to pay compensation and other amounts under this Act in respect of particular injury, loss or damage suffered by, or in respect of the death of, some or all of its employees; and

     * (b) such injury, loss, damage or death occurs;

    * then: 

     * (c) the licensee is liable to pay compensation and other amounts under this Act in respect of that injury, loss, damage or death; and

     * (d) Comcare is not liable to pay compensation or other amounts under this Act in respect of that injury, loss, damage or death.

    * (2) Nothing in subsection (1) affects Comcare's liability to pay compensation or other amounts under this Act in respect of a particular injury, loss, damage or death for which Comcare would have been liable, but for the operation of the licence, to the extent that the liability is not a liability that the licensee is authorised to accept.

    * (3) The fact that a licensee is authorised to accept liability to pay compensation and other amounts under this Act in respect of a particular injury, loss, damage or death does not render the licensee liable to have any proceedings (including proceedings under Part VI) brought against it in respect of that particular injury, loss, damage or death other than proceedings for the recovery of that compensation and those other amounts.

       * Note: If licensees are authorised to manage claims, proceedings may be brought against them in respect of the management of those claims (see subsection 108C(7)).

    * (4) If proceedings have been brought against Comcare in respect of a particular injury, loss, damage or death for which a licensee is liable to pay compensation or other amounts under this Act, Comcare must inform the licensee, in writing, as soon as practicable, that the proceedings have been brought.

    * (5) On being informed that proceedings have been brought against Comcare in respect of a particular injury, loss, damage or death, the court or tribunal before which the proceedings have been brought must, on application of the licensee, join the licensee as a party to the proceedings.

    * (6) A decision in any proceedings referred to in subsection (4) is binding on Comcare and on the licensee concerned, whether or not the licensee has made application to become a party to the proceedings.

    * (7) If a licensee who is a corporation is authorised to accept liability to pay compensation and other amounts under this Act in respect of a particular injury, loss or damage suffered by, or in respect of the death of, some or all of its employees after the licence comes into force then:

     * (a) no law of a State or Territory relating to workers compensation applies to a licensee in respect of such injury, loss, damage or death; and

     * (b) any liability or obligation of the corporation under a law of a State or Territory in respect of such injury, loss or damage suffered, or death occurring, before the licence came into force is unaffected.

#### Division 4--Authorisation to manage claims

##### 108B  Licence can authorise licensee to manage claims

    * (1) A licence may authorise the licensee, or a specified person acting on the licensee's behalf, to manage some or all of the claims made by employees of the licensee under this Act.

    * (2) The scope of the licence, so far as it authorises management by the licensee of claims made under this Act, may be determined by the Commission.

    * (3) A licensee may at any time enter into a contract with another person for the management, on the licensee's behalf, of the claims that the licensee is authorised to manage.

    * (4) If the licensee enters into such a contract it does not come into force unless and until the Commission has varied the licence to note the identity of the person with whom the licensee has contracted for the management of claims.

    * (5) Nothing in this section implies that the scope of the licence, so far as it authorises management of claims by the licensee, may not extend to the management of claims that were made at a time before the licence came into force, whether or not the management of those claims has been commenced before the licence came into force.

    * (6) The scope of the licence, so far as it authorises management of claims made by employees of an eligible corporation, must relate to the same employees of the corporation as those covered by the scope of the licence so far as it relates to acceptance of liability.

##### 108C  The consequences of a licensee's authorisation to manage claims

    * (1) If a licensee is authorised to manage claims, the licensee must determine any particular claim that the licensee is authorised to manage in accordance with the scope of its licence.

    * (2) If a licensee is authorised to manage claims made before the licence comes into force, then, in respect of any particular claim that the licensee is authorised to manage:

     * (a) a determination made by Comcare that is in force immediately before the licence comes into force is taken, after that time, to have been a determination made by the licensee in relation to that claim; and

     * (b) any other thing done by Comcare that is in force immediately before the licence comes into force is taken, after that time, to have been done by the licensee in relation to that claim.

    * (3) If a licensee is authorised to manage claims, then, in respect of any particular claim that the licensee is authorised to manage:

     * (a) any notice or claim given or made under Part V after the licence comes into force is to be given or made to the licensee; and

     * (b) any notice or claim given or made under Part V to Comcare, in force immediately before the licence comes into force, continues in force, after that time, as if it had been given or made to the licensee.

    * (4) If:

     * (a) any proceedings (including proceedings under Part VI) to which Comcare is a party are brought in relation to a determination made, or thing done, by Comcare before a licence comes into force; and

     * (b) those proceedings have not been concluded before the licence comes into force;

    * those proceedings may be continued after that time and, for the purpose of the proceedings as so continued, the licensee is taken to replace Comcare as a party to the proceedings.

    * (5) If, after a licence comes into force:

     * (a) a determination made or other thing done by Comcare is treated under subsection (2) as having been made or done by the licensee; or

     * (b) a notice or claim given or made under Part V to Comcare is treated under subsection (3) as if it had been given or made to the licensee; or

     * (c) proceedings (including proceedings under Part VI) to which Comcare is a party are treated under subsection (4) as proceedings to which the licensee is a party;

    * Comcare must inform the licensee, as soon as practicable, of that determination made or other thing done, of that notice or claim, or of those proceedings.

    * (6) If, in accordance with subsection (4), the licensee replaces Comcare as a party to the proceedings, the court or tribunal before which the proceedings have been brought must, on application by Comcare, join Comcare as a party to the proceedings.
