     *  	The Secretary may determine that a person commits a no show no pay failure, a connection failure, a reconnection failure or a serious failure.

     *  	A person commits such a failure by failing to comply with his or her obligations in relation to a participation payment. The participation payments are newstart allowance, and for some people, youth allowance, parenting payment and special benefit.

     *  	For a no show no pay failure, a penalty amount is deducted from the person's participation payment.

     *  	For a connection failure, a requirement may be imposed on the person (and if the person fails to comply with the requirement, the person commits a reconnection failure).

     *  	For a reconnection failure, generally a penalty amount is deducted from the person's participation payment until the person complies with a requirement imposed on the person.

     *  	For a serious failure, a participation payment is not payable to the person for 8 weeks. The 8 week period may be ended in certain circumstances.

     *  	The Secretary may also determine that a person is unemployed as a result of a voluntary act or misconduct. If the Secretary does so, a participation payment is not payable to the person for either 8 or 12 weeks, depending on the circumstances.

     *  	The Secretary may also determine that a participation payment is not payable to a person for a period because of certain failures. However, once that period ends, the person may be able to receive back pay.

##### 42B  Object of this Division

    * (1) The object of this Division is to encourage people to participate in employment and engage with employment services. It is also the object of this Division to secure compliance with a person's obligations and requirements in relation to participation payments, and to ensure that those who do not comply are reengaged with employment services as quickly as possible.
