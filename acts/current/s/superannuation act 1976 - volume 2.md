### Part VIAA--Superannuation guarantee topup benefit

##### 110SA  Purpose of Part

    * The purpose of this Part is to establish, in respect of certain persons who cease to be eligible employees, an entitlement to a benefit (called **_superannuation guarantee topup benefit_**) so that an employer of such a person while the person was an eligible employee does not have an individual superannuation guarantee shortfall within the meaning of the _Superannuation Guarantee (Administration) Act 1992 _in relation to that person in respect of the period, or any part of the period, during which the person was an eligible employee.

##### 110SB  Interpretation

    * (1) In this Part, unless the contrary intention appears:

    * **_accumulated government body contributions_**, in relation to a person's relevant period of employment, means the total of:

     * (a) the total amount of the productivity contributions applicable to the person in respect of the period; and

     * (b) notional interest on the amount worked out under paragraph (a).

    * **_government body scheme_** means a superannuation scheme:

     * (a) established by, or operating for the benefit of employees of:

      * (i) an authority of the Commonwealth; or

      * (ii) a State or an authority of a State; or

      * (iii) a Territory or an authority of a Territory; or

      * (iv) a body corporate in which the Commonwealth, or a person of the kind referred to in paragraph (i), (ii) or (iii), either individually or in combination with one or more other such persons, has a controlling interest; and

     * (b) that has eligible employees as members; and

     * (c) under which productivity contributions accrue in respect of those eligible employees.

    * **_notional accumulated SG contributions_**, in relation to a person's relevant period of employment, means an amount equal to the sum of:

     * (a) the person's SG minimum contributions in relation to that period as reduced by an amount specified in, or worked out in accordance with, a determination made by an actuary under subsection (5); and

     * (b) notional interest on the amount worked out under paragraph (a).

    * **_other vested benefit_**, in relation to a person, means the value that CSC, having regard to the advice of the Australian Government Actuary, determines to be the value that the benefits paid or payable in respect of the person's relevant period of employment would have if the total amount of these benefits were taken not to include:

     * (a) the amount equal to the total of whichever of the following amounts is, or are, applicable:

      * (i) the amount equal to that part of the accumulated employer contributions in respect of the person that is based on the operation of paragraph10Q(1)(a) and (b) in relation to productivity contributions paid or payable after 30 June 1992;

      * (ii) the amount equal to that part of an amount paid by or in respect of the person that is based on the operation of paragraph10Q(1)(e) and (f) in relation to payments made under section 110L in relation to any period commencing after 30 June 1992;

      * (iii) the amount equal to that part of an amount paid by or in respect of the person that is based on the operation of paragraph10Q(1)(e) and (f) in relation to payments made under section 110M in relation to any period commencing after 30 June 1992;

      * (iv) the amount equal to that part of an amount paid by or in respect of the person that is based on the operation of paragraph10Q(1)(e) and (f) in relation to payments made under section 110MA in relation to any period commencing after 30 June 1992;

     * (b) the amount equal to that part of the person's accumulated contributions based on contributions that became payable, by the person, after 30 June 1992;

     * (c) if a benefit is payable in respect of the person under Part VIAB--the amount equal to that benefit;

     * (d) if a benefit is payable in respect of the person under Subdivision B of Division 2 of Part IX--the amount equal to that benefit.

    * **_period of actual contributory service_**, in relation to a person, means the person's period of contributory service other than any part of that period added by the operation of subsection 128(5) that is not attributable to a transfer value previously paid under Division 3 of Part IX.

#### Division 2--Eligible employees with preserved rights from previous employment

##### Subdivision A--Transfer values

##### 127  Transfer value payable in relation to certain employment

    * (1) Subject to subsection (1AAA), a reference in this Division to a transfer value in relation to an eligible employee is a reference to:

     * (a) a lump sum benefit (**_a paragraph (a) benefit_**):

      * (i) payable in relation to an eligible employee under a superannuation scheme on the termination of employment or cessation of membership otherwise than on the ground of physical or mental incapacity to perform that employment; and

      * (ii) based wholly on contributions by the employer under the scheme or partly on such contributions and partly on contributions by the eligible employee under the scheme;

     * unless that benefit has been applied for the purchase of a deferred annuity or paid into a preservation fund; or

     * (b) an amount payable to or in relation to the eligible employee on surrender of a deferred annuity if a paragraph (a) benefit had been applied for the purchase of that annuity; or

     * (c) an amount payable to or in relation to the eligible employee if that amount is payable from a preservation fund in relation to a paragraph (a) benefit paid to the fund for the benefit of the eligible employee; or

     * (d) an amount payable to, or in relation to, the eligible employee in accordance with Part 8 of the_ Superannuation Guarantee (Administration) Act 1992_.

    * (1AAA) In this Division, a reference to a transfer value in relation to an eligible employee does not include a reference to any part of a lump sum benefit payable under a superannuation scheme that is based on contributions by the employee under the scheme that are of a similar nature to supplementary contributions under this Act or to contributions under the superseded Act for reserve units of pension.

    * (1AA) For the purposes of subsection (1), an amount that is a productivity related benefit within the meaning of Part VIA is not to be treated as a transfer value if the productivity related benefit would be the whole of the transfer value.

    * (2) If, after a transfer value became payable to or in respect of a person under a superannuation scheme, an amount equal to the whole or any part of that transfer value was paid to a person administering another superannuation scheme (not being the scheme constituted by the provisions of this Act):

     * (a) where the whole of the transfer value was so paid--that transfer value shall be disregarded for the purposes of this Division; or

     * (b) where part of the transfer value was so paid--the amount of that transfer value shall be deemed for the purposes of this Division, to be reduced by the amount so paid.

    * (3) Subject to subsection (4), a transfer value shall be deemed, for the purposes of this Division, to have become payable in respect of a person under a superannuation scheme upon the termination of any employment if, upon the termination of that employment, the person was the owner of a life policy, or was entitled to have the rights of the owner of a life policy assigned to him or her, being a policy the premiums for which were, while the person was employed in that employment, paid in whole or in part by the person's employer, and, in that case, the surrender value of the policy as at the date of the termination of the employment shall be taken to be the amount of the transfer value.

    * (4) Where a transfer value is, by virtue of subsection (3), to be deemed, for the purposes of this Division, to have become payable in respect of a person upon the termination of any employment by reason that, upon the termination of that employment, the person was the owner of a life policy, or was entitled to have the rights of the owner of a life policy assigned to him or her, a transfer value shall not be deemed, for those purposes, to have become payable in respect of the person upon the termination of any previous employment by reason that, upon the termination of that previous employment, the person was the owner of that policy, or was entitled to have the rights of the owner of that policy assigned to him or her.

##### 128  Payment of transfer values to CSC

     * (a) the transfer value or transfer values, as the case may be, became payable on or after 25 May 1971; and

     * (b) the eligible employee elects by written notice given to CSC to pay CSC an amount (**_the election amount_**) equal to the amount of the transfer value or, if 2 or more transfer values became payable, the total of the amounts of those transfer values:

     * must be paid by CSC into the Superannuation Fund, and, for the purposes of this Act, the amount so paid is taken to be productivity contributions within the meaning of Part VIA.

    * (3) If, upon the person ceasing to be an eligible employee, a lump sum benefit becomes payable to or in respect of him or her under or in accordance with subsection 62(2) or (2A), 69(2), 72(2), 73(2), 84(2), 87(2), 88(1), 99(2) or 101(2), then, for the purpose of calculating the amount of that benefit, the amount of his or her accumulated basic contributions shall be deemed to be the amount that would have been the amount of his or her accumulated basic contributions if the amount paid into the Superannuation Fund in respect of him or her under paragraph (2)(a) of this section had been an amount equal to twosevenths of the transferred amount (other than so much of that transferred amount as is worked out under paragraph (2)(c)).

    * (4) If, upon the person ceasing to be an eligible employee, a lump sum benefit becomes payable to or in respect of him or her under section 80 or 111 and the amount, or a part of the amount, paid to the Commonwealth in respect of him or her under paragraph (2)(b) of this section is an amount that, whether or not he or she engaged in further employment, was payable to or in respect of him or her on the termination of the previous employment, there is payable to or in respect of the person an additional lump sum benefit of an amount equal to the total of:

    * (3) If, at the operative time, additional pension is payable in respect of the original interest, then the nonmember spouse is entitled to associate additional pension from the operative time, at the rate calculated under the Orders by reference to the transfer amount.

    * Deferred benefits if operative time in growth phase

    * (4) If, at the operative time, standard pension is not payable in respect of the original interest, then the nonmember spouse is entitled to associate deferred benefits in accordance with section 146MC.

##### 146MC  Associate deferred benefits

    * (1) Associate deferred benefits consist of:

     * (a) a lump sum equal to the funded component of the transfer amount, plus interest determined under section 154A; and

     * (b) an associate deferred pension at an annual rate calculated under the Orders by reference to the unfunded component.

    * (3) The nonmember spouse may give a written notice to CSC specifying a date that is not earlier than the 55th anniversary of the nonmember spouse's birth. However, the notice has no effect if, under the SIS Act, the associate deferred pension is not permitted to be paid in cash to the nonmember spouse from the specified date.

    * (4) The benefits are not payable unless:

     * (a) a written application has been made to CSC requesting payment of the benefits; and

     * (b) the applicant has given CSC any information that is necessary to enable CSC to determine whether the benefits are payable.

    * (5) If the nonmember spouse dies before the benefits become payable, CSC must pay the following amounts to the legal personal representative or, if no legal personal representative can be found, to any individual or individuals that CSC determines:

     * (a) the amount referred to in paragraph (1)(a);

     * (b) an amount calculated under the Orders in respect of the associate deferred pension.

##### 146MD  Commutation of small associate pension

    * (1) If:

     * (a) the total annual rate of associate standard pension and associate additional pension (if any) to which the nonmember spouse becomes entitled; or

     * (b) the annual rate of associate deferred pension to which the nonmember spouse becomes entitled;

    * is less than the amount determined under the Orders, then the nonmember spouse may elect to commute those pensions or that pension.

    * (2) The election must be made in writing to CSC not later than 3 months after the nonmember spouse becomes entitled to the pensions or pension.

    * (3) If the nonmember spouse makes the election, then the nonmember spouse is entitled instead to:

     * (a) if paragraph (1)(a) applies--a lump sum equal to the transfer amount; or

     * (b) if paragraph (1)(b) applies--a lump sum calculated under the Orders.

#### Division 3--Reduction of benefits for member spouse

##### 146ME  Operative time during growth phase--reduction of benefits

    * (1) This section applies if:

     * (a) at the operative time, standard pension is not payable in respect of the original interest; and

     * (b) the original interest is not an entitlement to associate deferred benefits.

    * Reduction of accumulated contributions etc.

    * (2) The following amounts are reduced in respect of the original interest:

     * (a) the accumulated basic contributions are reduced by the sum of:

      * (i) the basic contributions component; and

      * (ii) the interest accruing on that component after the operative time;

     * (b) the accumulated supplementary contributions are reduced by the sum of:

      * (i) the supplementary contributions component; and

      * (ii) the interest accruing on that component after the operative time;

     * (c) the accumulated employer contributions are reduced by the sum of:

      * (i) the employer contributions component; and

      * (ii) the interest accruing on that component after the operative time;

     * (d) any benefit under section 110SN is reduced by the sum of:

      * (i) the section 110SL component; and

      * (ii) the interest accruing on that component after the operative time;

     * (e) any benefit under section 130D is reduced by the sum of:

      * (i) the section 130B component; and

      * (ii) the interest accruing on that component after the operative time.

    * Reduction of later salarybased pension

    * (3) If, after the operative time, salarybased pension (the **_original pension_**) becomes payable to the member spouse in respect of the original interest, then the annual rate of the original pension is reduced to the amount worked out using the formula:

        * Note: If the member spouse dies without becoming entitled to salarybased pension, then subsection (3) will nevertheless result in an indirect reduction of any spouse's pension that becomes payable to a surviving spouse. This happens because the amount of the spouse's pension is based on the amount of invalidity pension (salarybased pension) that would have become payable to the member spouse at the time of death.

    * Multiple interest splits for same original interest

    * (4) If, before the original pension becomes payable, the original interest has been split more than once (that is to say, section 146MB has applied more than once), then, in applying the formula in subsection (3), the reduction factor is to be replaced by the number calculated using the following steps, based on the chronological order of the operative times (starting with the earliest):

     * (a) calculate a factor (the **_interim factor_**) using the steps in paragraphs (a) to (c) of the definition of **_reduction factor_** in subsection (6);

     * (b) calculate a factor (the **_interim factor_**) for the next split (the **_current split_**), using the formula:

     * where: 

     * **_unreduced current factor_** means the number calculated using the steps in paragraphs (a) and (b) of the definition of **_reduction factor_** in subsection (6);

     * (c) calculate a factor for each remaining split (if any), using the formula in paragraph (b);

     * (d) add together the factors calculated under paragraphs (a) to (c).

    * Reduction not to affect later nonstandard pension

    * (5) A reduction under subsection (3) is to be disregarded in calculating the amount of any nonstandard pension that later becomes payable.

        * Note: For example, the reduction will be disregarded in calculating the amount of orphan pension payable in respect of a child of the member spouse after the member spouse's death.

    * (6) In this section:

    * **_age factor_** means:

     * (a) if the age in full years is 65 or more--1; or

     * (b) if the age in full years is less than 65--1 reduced by 0.02 per year from 64 years to 60 years, and then by 0.03 per year from 59 years to 31 years.

    * **_final salary amount_** means the number of whole dollars in the member spouse's final annual rate of salary.

    * **_original pension amount_** means the number of whole dollars in the original pension.

    * **_reduction factor_** means the number worked out as follows:

     * (a) calculate a number (the **_service factor_**), by reference to the member spouse's period of contributory service before the operative time, by adding:

      * (i) for service that occurred within the first 20 years:

         * (A) 0.02 for each full year; and

         * (B) 0.02/365 for each leftover day; and

      * (ii) for service that occurred within the next 10 years:

         * (A) 0.01 for each full year; and

         * (B) 0.01/365 for each leftover day; and

      * (iii) for service that occurred within the next 10 years:

         * (A) 0.0025 for each full year; and

         * (B) 0.0025/365 for each leftover day;

     * (b) if the original pension is age retirement pension or early retirement pension, multiply the service factor by the age factor (based on the member spouse's age in full years at the time when the original pension became payable);

     * (c) multiply the number worked out under paragraphs (a) and (b) by the transfer factor.

    * **_salarybased pension_** means a pension that is calculated by reference to the member spouse's final annual rate of salary.

##### 146MF  Operative time during growth phase--reduction where original interest is entitlement to associate deferred benefits

    * (1) This section applies if:

     * (a) at the operative time, standard pension is not payable in respect of the original interest; and

     * (b) the original interest is an entitlement to associate deferred benefits.

    * (2) The deferred benefits, when they become payable, are reduced in accordance with the Orders.

##### 146MG  Operative time during payment phase--reduction of pension

    * (1) If, at the operative time, standard pension is payable in respect of the original interest, then the annual rate of that pension is reduced to the amount calculated under the Orders.

    * (2) If, at the operative time, additional pension is payable in respect of the original interest, then the annual rate of that pension is reduced to the amount calculated under the Orders.

    * (3) A reduction under this section is to be disregarded in calculating the amount of any nonstandard pension that later becomes payable.

        * Note: For example, the reduction will be disregarded in calculating the amount of orphan pension payable in respect of the child of the member spouse after the member spouse's death.

#### Division 4--Miscellaneous

##### 146MH  Ministerial Orders

    * (1) The Minister may, by legislative instrument, make Orders prescribing matters required or permitted by this Part to be prescribed.

    * (2) Despite anything in section 44 of the _Legislative Instruments Act 2003_, section 42 of that Act applies to an Order made under subsection (1) of this section.

### Part IXC--Sustaining the superannuation contribution concession: release of benefits to meet deferred tax liability

##### 146RA  Definitions

    * In this Part: 

    * **_release authority lump sum_** has the meaning given by section 146RB.

##### 146RB  Release of benefits under a release authority

    * (1) A lump sum (the **_release authority lump sum_**) may be paid at a time in compliance with a release authority issued to a person under item 3 of the table in subsection 13510(1) in Schedule 1 to the _Taxation Administration Act 1953 _and given to CSC in accordance with Subdivision 135B in that Schedule if:

     * (a) at or before that time, the person gives CSC written notice of the person's election under section 146RC of this Act (which deals with the reduction of benefits to reflect the release authority lump sum); and

     * (b) at that time, either:

      * (i) there is no surcharge deduction amount in relation to the person; or

      * (ii) subsection (2) applies.

        * Note: The purpose of the release authority is to allow a lump sum to be paid to the Commissioner to meet a debt the person has under Subdivision 133C in Schedule 1 to the _Taxation Administration Act 1953_.

    * Surcharge election must be made or forgone

    * (2) This subsection applies if any of the following are satisfied:

     * (a) the person has made an election under section 80B or 80C (which deal with the adjustment of benefits to take account of the surcharge deduction amount);

     * (b) the person has not made an election under either of those sections and the periods within which such elections may be made have expired;

     * (c) the person gives CSC written notice that the person forgoes making an election under both of those sections.

##### 146RC  Election specifying which benefit is to be reduced

    * (1) A person who gives CSC a release authority in accordance with Division 135 in Schedule 1 to the _Taxation Administration Act 1953_ may make an election specifying which of the following is to be reduced to reflect the release authority lump sum:

     * (a) a lump sum benefit to which the person is (or is about to become) entitled under this Act (unless the lump sum benefit has already been paid);

     * (b) a pension to which the person is (or is about to become) entitled under this Act (whether or not the pension has started to be paid).

    * (2) However, a person cannot specify that 2 or more benefits are to be reduced to reflect a release authority lump sum, unless the person elects to reduce all, or all but one, of the specified benefits to zero.

##### 146RD  Limit on amount that may be released

    * (1) In addition to any requirements in Division 135 in Schedule 1 to the _Taxation Administration Act 1953_, the amount of a release authority lump sum must not have the effect that a benefit specified in an election under section 146RC is reduced below zero.

    * (2) For the purpose of subsection (1), the effect of a release authority lump sum on the amount of a benefit specified in an election under section 146RC is to be worked out after taking account of:

     * (a) the person's surcharge deduction amount (if any); and

     * (b) any reduction under section 79D (which deals with reductions for early release lump sums); and

     * (c) any reductions under Division 3 of Part IXB (which deals with family law splitting).

##### 146RE  Calculation of benefits after payment of release authority lump sum

    *  		(1) If a release authority lump sum is paid in relation to a release authority issued to a person, the benefits to which the person is entitled under this Act must be reduced to reflect the release authority lump sum, in accordance with the person's election under section 146RC.

    * (2) If the election specifies that a pension is to be reduced (but not to zero), the annual rate of the pension is to be reduced so that it equals the amount worked out using this formula:

    * where: 

    * **_conversion factor_** means the factor that is applicable to the person under the determination made by CSC under subsection (4).
