     * (a) the contribution was or is made on or after 1 July 2003 to:

      * (i) a fund that is a complying superannuation fund in relation to the income year of the fund in which the contribution was or is made; or

      * (ii) an RSA the person holds; and

     * (b) the contribution was or is made for the purpose of providing superannuation benefits for the person (regardless whether the benefits are payable to the person's dependants if the person dies before or after becoming entitled to receive the benefits); and

     * (c) the contribution is not any of the following:

      * (i) a rollover superannuation benefit (within the meaning of the _Income Tax Assessment Act 1997_);

     * (c) the total of the person's reportable employer superannuation contributions (within the meaning of the _Income Tax Assessment Act 1997_) for the income year.

    * (2) However, the person's **_total income_** for the income year is reduced by amounts (if any) for which the person is entitled to a deduction as a result of carrying on a business (within the meaning of the _Income Tax Assessment Act 1997_).

    * (3) Subsection (2) does not apply for the purposes of paragraph 6(1)(b).

##### 9  Basic rule--Government cocontribution matches personal contributions

    * (1) The amount of the Government cocontribution in respect of a person for an income year is:

     * (a) for the 200304 income year--an amount equal to the sum of the eligible personal superannuation contributions the person makes during the income year; and

     * (b) for the 200405 income year, the 200506 income year, the 200607 income year, the 200708 income year or the 200809 income year--an amount equal to 150% of the sum of the eligible personal superannuation contributions the person makes during the income year; and

     * (c) for the 200910, 201011 and 201112 income years--an amount equal to the sum of the eligible personal superannuation contributions the person makes during the income year; and

    * (1A) The amount of the Government cocontribution in respect of a person for the 200405 income year, the 200506 income year, the 200607 income year, the 200708 income year or the 200809 income year must not exceed the maximum amount worked out using the following table:

    * (1B) The amount of the Government cocontribution in respect of a person for the 200910 income year, 201011 income year or 201112 income year must not exceed the maximum amount worked out using the following table:

    * (2) Subsections (1), (1A), (1B) and (1C) have effect subject to sections 10A, 11, 12, 21, 22 and 23.

##### 10A  Increases in lower and higher income threshold

    * (1) This section provides for:

     * (a) indexation of the lower income threshold for the 200708 income year and later income years (apart from the 201011, 201112 and 201213 income years); and

     * (b) increases in the higher income threshold for the 200708 income year and each later income year (apart from the 201011, 201112 and 201213 income years) equal to the indexation increase in the lower income threshold for that year.

    * (2) The **_lower income threshold_** for an income year is:

     * (a) for the 200304 income year--$27,500; or

     * (b) for the 200405 income year or a later income year before the 200708 income year--$28,000; or

     * (c) for the 200708 income year--$28,000 multiplied by the indexation factor for that income year; or

     * (d) for a later income year--the amount of the lower income threshold for the previous income year multiplied by the indexation factor for that later income year.

    * (3) The **_higher income threshold_** for an income year is:

     * (a) for the 200304 income year--$40,000; or

     * (b) for the 200405 income year or a later income year before the 200708 income year--$58,000; or

     * (c) for the 200708 income year or a later income year before the 201213 income year--the sum of:

      * (i) the lower income threshold for that income year; and

      * (ii) $30,000; or

     * (d) for the 201213 income year or a later income year--the sum of:

      * (i) the lower income threshold for that income year; and

      * (ii) $15,000.

    * (4) If the lower income threshold for an income year is an amount of dollars and cents:

     * (a) if the number of cents is less than 50--the lower income threshold is to be rounded down to the nearest whole dollar; or

     * (b) otherwise--the lower income threshold is to be rounded up to the nearest whole dollar.

    * (5) The **_indexation factor_** for an income year is the number calculated, to 3 decimal places, using the formula:

    * where: 

    * **_current year_** means the period of 12 months ending on 31 December immediately before the income year for which the lower income threshold is being calculated.

    * **_index number_**, for a quarter, means the estimate of fulltime adult average weekly ordinary time earnings for the middle month of the quarter published by the Australian Statistician.

    * **_previous year_** means the period of 12 months immediately before the current year.

    * (5A) Despite subsection (5), the **_indexation factor_** for the 201011, 201112 and 201213 income years is 1.

    * (6) If the number calculated under subsection (5) for a financial year would, if it were worked out to 4 decimal places, end with a number greater than 4, the number so calculated is increased by 0.001.

    * (7) If at any time, whether before or after the commencement of this Act, the Australian Statistician has published or publishes an index number for a quarter in substitution for an index number previously published for the quarter, the publication of the later index number is to be disregarded.

    * (8) The Commissioner must publish before, or as soon as practicable after, the start of the 200708 income year, and before the start of each later income year, the lower income threshold and the higher income threshold for the income year.

##### 11  Minimum Government cocontribution

    * If the amount of the Government cocontribution in respect of a person for an income year, as calculated under sections 9 and 10 would be less than $20, the amount of the cocontribution is to be increased to $20.

##### 12  Government cocontribution increased by interest amount if paid late in certain circumstances

    * (1) The amount of the Government cocontribution in respect of a person for an income year is increased by the amount of interest worked out under subsection (2) if the Commissioner pays none of the Government cocontribution on or before the payment date for the cocontribution.

    * (2) The interest is to be calculated:

     * (a) on the amount of the Government cocontribution; and

     * (b) for the period from the payment date for the Government cocontribution until the day on which the Commissioner first pays an amount in satisfaction of the Government cocontribution; and

     * (c) on a daily basis; and

     * (d) at the base interest rate for the day on which the interest is calculated.

##### 12A  Amount of the Government cocontribution for 200506 income year

    * (1) This section applies for the purposes of working out the amount of the Government cocontribution in respect of a person for the 200506 income year.

    * (2) Despite sections 9, 10, 10A and 11, that amount is double the amount worked out under those sections in respect of the person for the 200506 income year.

    * (3) Subsection (2) has effect subject to sections 12, 21, 22 and 23.

    * (4) For the purposes of working out an amount of interest under section 12, 21 or 22 in relation to the Government cocontribution in respect of a person for the 200506 income year:

     * (a) disregard subsection (2); and

     * (b) treat an amount paid by the Commissioner as not including any amount paid by the Commissioner because of subsection (2).

### Part 2A--Low income superannuation contribution

##### 12B  Reference to Government cocontribution includes reference to low income superannuation contribution

    * (1) A law of the Commonwealth applies in relation to a low income superannuation contribution in the same way as it applies in relation to a Government cocontribution.

    * (2) Subsection (1) does not apply to:

     * (a) the following provisions:

      * (i) Part 2 of this Act (other than section 12);

      * (ii) this Part;

      * (iia) section 23;

      * (iii) section 54 of this Act; and

     * (b) any other law of the Commonwealth, to the extent that the other law relates to a provision mentioned in paragraph (a) of this subsection.

    * (3) Paragraph 14(1)(a) (Commissioner to have regard to income tax return) does not apply in deciding whether to make a determination under section 13 that a low income superannuation contribution is payable under subsection 12C(2) in respect of a person for an income year.

    * (4) Subsections 24(3) and (4) have an operation in respect of low income superannuation contributions that is separate to their operation in respect of Government cocontributions.

##### 12C  Person entitled to low income superannuation contribution

    * (1) A low income superannuation contribution is payable under this subsection in respect of a person for an income year of the person if:

     * (a) the person's concessional contributions for the financial year that corresponds to the income year are for a financial year starting on or after 1 July 2012; and

     * (b) the person's adjusted taxable income for the income year (worked out in accordance with Schedule 3 to the _A New Tax System (Family Assistance) Act 1999 _(disregarding clauses 3 and 3A of that Schedule)) does not exceed $37,000; and

     * (c) the requirement in paragraph 6(1)(b) is satisfied in respect of the person in relation to the income year; and

     * (d) the requirement in paragraph 6(1)(f) is satisfied in respect of the person in relation to the income year.

    * (2) A low income superannuation contribution is payable under this subsection in respect of a person for an income year of the person if:

     * (a) the person's concessional contributions for the financial year that corresponds to the income year are for a financial year starting on or after 1 July 2012; and

     * (b) 12 months after the end of the income year, the Commissioner reasonably believes there is insufficient information to decide whether to make a determination under section 13 that a low income superannuation contribution is payable under subsection (1) in respect of the person for the income year; and

     * (c) the Commissioner estimates that:

      * (i) the person's adjusted taxable income for the income year (worked out in accordance with Schedule 3 to the _A New Tax System (Family Assistance) Act 1999_ (disregarding clauses 3 and 3A of that Schedule)) does not exceed $37,000; and

      * (ii) 10% or more of the person's total income for the income year (disregarding subsections 8(2) and (3)) is attributable to the person engaging in activities covered under subsection 6(2); and

     * (d) the requirement in paragraph 6(1)(f) is satisfied in respect of the person in relation to the income year.

    * (3) For the purposes of paragraph (1)(c), disregard the words "in which the person makes the contribution" in paragraph 6(2)(a).

    * (4) For the purposes of subparagraph (2)(c)(i), treat the person as having total deductions of $300 for the income year unless the Commissioner has information to the contrary.

##### 12E  Amount of low income superannuation contribution

    * (1) This section applies if a low income superannuation contribution is payable under subsection 12C(1) or (2) in respect of a person for an income year.

    * (2) The amount of the person's low income superannuation contribution for the income year is:

     * (a) unless paragraph (b) or (c) applies--15% of the total of the person's concessional contributions for the financial year that corresponds to the income year; or

     * (b) if the amount worked out under paragraph (a) exceeds $500--$500; or

     * (c) if the amount worked out under paragraph (a) is less than $10--$10.

    * (3) If, apart from this subsection:

     * (a) there would be an underpaid amount as mentioned in section 19 in respect of the person's low income superannuation contribution for the income year; and

     * (b) the underpaid amount would be less than $10;

    * decrease the amount of that low income superannuation contribution by that underpaid amount.

    * (4) If, apart from this subsection:

     * (a) there would be an amount overpaid as mentioned in section 24 in respect of the person's low income superannuation contribution for the income year; and

    * increase the amount of that low income superannuation contribution by that amount overpaid.

##### 12F  Consequences if estimates no longer accurate

     * (b) the Commissioner decides that, had the Commissioner obtained that information before making the determination, the Commissioner would not have made the determination.
