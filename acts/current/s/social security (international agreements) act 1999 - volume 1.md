       * (b) a period of Australian working life residence equal to or greater than the period identified in accordance with paragraph 4 for that person; and

       * (c) a German period of coverage,

    * then for the purposes of a claim for that Australian benefit, that German period of coverage shall be deemed, only for the purposes of meeting any minimum qualifying periods for that benefit set out in the Australian legislation, to be a period in which that person was an Australian resident.

       * (a) has been an Australian resident for a continuous period which is less than the minimum continuous period required by the Australian legislation for qualification of that person for a benefit; and

    * the total of the German periods of coverage shall be deemed to be one continuous period.

    * 3.	For the purposes of this Article, where a person's period as an Australian resident and a German period of coverage coincide, the period of coincidence shall be taken into account once only by Australia as a period as an Australian resident.

    * 4.	The minimum period of Australian working life residence to be taken into account for the purposes of paragraph 1 shall be as follows:

       * (a) for the purposes of an Australian benefit that is payable to a person who is not an Australian resident, the minimum period required shall be 12 months, of which at least six months must be continuous; and

    * 1.	Subject to paragraph 2, where a person who is outside Australia is qualified for an Australian benefit by virtue of this Agreement, other than double orphan pension, the rate of benefit shall be determined according to the Australian legislation.

    * 2.	Subject to paragraph 3, where an Australian benefit is payable, whether by virtue of this Agreement or otherwise, to a person who is outside Australia, the rate of that benefit shall be determined according to Australian legislation but, when assessing the income of that person for the purposes of calculating the rate of the Australian benefit, only a proportion of the German benefit shall be regarded as income. That proportion shall be calculated by multiplying the number of whole months (not exceeding 300) of Australian working life residence used in the assessment of that person's Australian benefit by the amount of German benefit and dividing that product by 300.

    * 3.	Only a person receiving a proportionalised Australian benefit shall be entitled to receive the concessional assessment of income described in paragraph 2.

       * (b) deducting that German benefit from the maximum rate of that Australian benefit; and

       * (c) applying to the remaining benefit obtained under subparagraph (b) the relevant rate calculation set out in the Australian legislation, using as the person's income the amount calculated under subparagraph (a).

    * 7.	The provisions in paragraph 6 shall continue to apply for 26 weeks where a person departs temporarily from .

    * 8.	Where a member of a couple is, or both that member and his or her partner are, entitled to a German benefit or benefits and/or any payment referred to in this Article, each of them shall be deemed, for the purposes of this Article and of the Australian legislation, to be in receipt of one half of either the amount of that benefit or the total of both of those benefits, as the case may be. 

Article 9

  * Payment of Australian benefits overseas

    * 1.	Australian benefits are also payable into the territory of the Federal Republic of Germany.

    * 2.	Where the Australian legislation provides that a benefit is payable outside the territory of , then that benefit, when payable under this Agreement, is also payable outside the territories of both Contracting Parties.

       * (c) departs  within a period specified in that legislation,

2.	Subject to paragraphs 3 and 4 of this Article, where an Australian benefit is payable to a person outside Australia only by virtue of this Agreement, and the person had ceased to be an Australian resident on the date of entry into force of this Agreement, the rate of that benefit shall be determined by:

         * 2.1	calculating that person's income according to the legislation of Australia, including any benefit payable under the legislation of the former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia which that person or the partner of that person is entitled to receive, if applicable;

         * 2.2	applying to the maximum rate of Australian benefit the relevant rate calculator set out in the legislation of Australia, using as the person's income the amount calculated under subparagraph 2.1 of this Article; and

        * 5.2	deducting the amount of the benefit under the legislation of the former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia which that person is entitled to receive from the maximum rate of that Australian benefit; and

        * 5.3	applying to the remaining benefit obtained under subparagraph 5.2 of this Article the relevant rate calculation set out in the legislation of Australia, using as the person's income the amount calculated under subparagraph 5.1.

6.	Where a person departs temporarily from Australia, paragraph 5 of this Article shall continue to apply for 26 weeks from the date of their departure from Australia.

7.	Where a member of a couple is, or both that person and his or her partner are, entitled to a benefit or benefits under the legislation of the former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia each of them shall be deemed, for the purposes of this Article and of the legislation of Australia, to be in receipt of one half of either the amount of that benefit or the total of both of those benefits, as the case may be.

If after applying paragraph 1 of this Article, a person is not entitled to a benefit, the Competent Institution of the former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia shall also take into account periods of insurance or residence completed by its citizens in a third country that has concluded an agreement on social security with the former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia, which includes provision to combine insurance periods.

**Article 14**

Determination of Benefits for the former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia**

**1.

2.	If according to the legislation of the former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia the entitlement to benefits arises solely under the provisions of paragraph 1 of Article 13, the Competent Institution of the former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia shall provide such benefits as follows:

       * 2.1	a theoretical amount of the benefit shall be established, to which the person would be entitled as if the total accumulated periods (insurance periods and periods of Australian working life residence) were fulfilled under the legislation of the former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia;

       * 2.2	on the basis of this theoretical amount, the actual amount shall be established according to the periods of insurance as a proportion of the total accumulated periods;

       * (a) is an Australian resident or a resident of the Czech Republic or a third State with which Australia has concluded an agreement on social security which includes provision for cooperation in the acceptance of claims for benefits and which includes that category of benefit; and

       * (b) is in Australia, or the Czech Republic or that third State,

that person, so long as he or she has been an Australian resident at some time, shall be deemed, for the purpose of lodging that claim, to be an Australian resident and in Australia on that date.

**Article 11**

Totalisation**

**1.	Where a person to whom this Agreement applies has claimed an Australian benefit under this Agreement and has accumulated:

       * (a) a period as an Australian resident that is less than the period required to qualify that person, on that ground, under the legislation of Australia for that benefit; and

       * (b) a period of Australian working life residence equal to or greater than the period identified in accordance with paragraph 4 for that person; and

       * (c) a creditable period completed under the legislation of the Czech Republic;

then, for the purposes of a claim for that Australian benefit, that creditable period completed under the legislation of the Czech Republic shall be deemed to be a period in which that person was an Australian resident only for the purposes of meeting any minimum qualifying periods for that benefit set out in the legislation of Australia.

2.	For the purposes of paragraph 1, where a person:

       * (a) has been an Australian resident for a continuous period which is less than the minimum continuous period required by the legislation of Australia for entitlement of that person to a benefit; and

       * (b) has accumulated a creditable period completed under the legislation of the Czech Republic in two or more separate periods that equals or exceeds in total the minimum period referred to in subparagraph (a);

the total of the creditable periods completed under the legislation of the Czech Republic shall be deemed to be one continuous period.

3.	For the purposes of this Article, where a period by a person as an Australian resident and a creditable period completed under the legislation of the Czech Republic coincide, the period of coincidence shall be taken into account once only by Australia as a period as an Australian resident.

4.	The minimum period of Australian working life residence to be taken into account for the purposes of paragraph 1 shall be as follows:

       * (a) for the purposes of an Australian benefit that is payable to a person who is not an Australian resident, the minimum period required shall be 12 months, of which at least six months must be continuous; and

       * (b) for the purposes of an Australian benefit that is payable to an Australian resident, there shall be no minimum period.

**Article 12**

Calculation of Benefits**

**1.	Subject to paragraph 2, where an Australian benefit is payable only by virtue of this Agreement to a person who is outside Australia, the rate of that benefit shall be determined according to the legislation of Australia.

2.	Paragraph 1 shall continue to apply for 26 weeks where a person comes temporarily to Australia.

3.	Subject to paragraph 4, where an Australian benefit is payable only by virtue of this Agreement to a person who is in Australia, the rate of that benefit shall be determined by:

       * (a) calculating that person's income according to the legislation of Australia but disregarding in that calculation any Czech Republic benefit which that person or the partner of that person is entitled to receive if applicable; and

       * (b) deducting the amount of the Czech Republic benefit which that person is entitled to receive from the maximum rate of that Australian benefit; and

       * (c) applying to the remaining benefit obtained under subparagraph (b) the relevant rate calculation set out in the legislation of Australia, using as the person's income the amount calculated under subparagraph (a).

4.	Paragraph 3 shall continue to apply for 26 weeks where a person departs temporarily from Australia.

5.	Where a member of a couple is, or both that person and his or her partner are, entitled to a Czech Republic benefit or benefits, each of them shall be deemed, for the purposes of this Article and of the legislation of Australia, to be in receipt of one half of either the amount of that benefit or the total of both of those benefits, as the case may be.

6.	Australian age pension shall include additional amounts for dependent children, if applicable, when payable outside Australia under this Agreement. Other additional amounts or supplements to a benefit shall be payable outside Australia only for the period specified in the _Social Security Act 1991_. The reference to the _Social Security Act 1991_ includes any laws that subsequently amend, supplement or replace that Act.

**Chapter 2**

Czech Republic Benefits**

Article 13**

Totalisation**

**1.	Unless otherwise provided in this Agreement, if a person is not eligible for a benefit because he or she has not completed sufficient creditable periods under the legislation of the Czech Republic, the eligibility of that person for that benefit shall be determined by totalising these creditable periods and periods of Australian working life residence, provided those periods do not overlap.

2.	For eligibility for the benefit, the Competent Institution of the Czech Republic shall take into account also creditable periods completed under the legislation of a third State, with which the Czech Republic is bound by social security instruments which provide for the totalising of creditable periods.

    * **Article 14**

    * Calculation of benefits**

**1.	If, under the legislation of the Czech Republic, the conditions for entitlement to benefits are satisfied without taking into account periods of Australian working life residence, the Competent Institution of the Czech Republic shall determine the benefit:

      * (a) on the basis of the creditable periods completed exclusively under its legislation, and at the same time

      * (b) according to the rules provided by paragraph (2), with the exception when the result of this calculation is equal to or lower than the result of the calculation under subparagraph (a).

2.	If, under the legislation of the Czech Republic, the right to benefits can be acquired only with regard to periods of Australian working life residence, or creditable periods completed under the legislation of a third State, then the Competent Institution of the Czech Republic shall:

       * (a) calculate the theoretical amount of the benefit which could have been claimed if all these periods had been completed under the legislation of the Czech Republic and

       * (b) then - on the basis of the theoretical amount calculated in accordance with subparagraph (a) - shall determine the amount of the benefit payable by applying the ratio of the duration of the creditable periods completed under the legislation of the Czech Republic to the total combined periods.

In order to determine the basis for calculation of the benefit, the Competent Institution of the Czech Republic shall - in applying the provision of subparagraph (a) of this paragraph - take into account only income gained during the creditable periods completed under the legislation which it applies. This income - indexed according to Czech legislation - will be considered as gained during the periods that are taken into account for the calculation of the theoretical amount of the benefit.

3.	The person concerned shall be entitled to the highest amount calculated in accordance with paragraphs 1 and 2 from the Competent Institution of the Czech Republic.

4.	If the creditable period completed under the legislation of the Czech Republic is less than 12 months and does not result in any right to benefits, then the Competent Institution of the Czech Republic will not award the benefit.

5.	Events and facts that have legal effect on entitlement, reduction, suspension or benefit amount, and which occurred in the territory of Australia, shall be taken into account as if they had taken place in the territory of the Czech Republic. However, the Czech Competent Authority may, in the interest of categories of beneficiaries, limit the application of this provision.

6.	A person whose disability began before reaching the age of 18 and who has not participated in the insurance scheme for the necessary period shall have the right to a disability benefit provided this person is a resident of the Czech Republic. This condition shall also apply to invalidity and survivors' benefits, where such entitlement, or benefits from which they are derived, can be acquired only with regard to provisions of this Agreement.

4.	The reference in paragraph 1 to an appeal is a reference to an appeal that may be made to an administrative body established by, or administratively for the purposes of, the respective legislation.

       * (a) is an Australian resident or a resident of the Slovak Republic; and

       * (b) is in Australia, or the Slovak Republic,

that person, so long as he or she has been an Australian resident at some time, shall be deemed, for the purpose of lodging that claim, to be an Australian resident and in Australia on that date.

**Article 12**

Totalisation**

**1.	Where a person to whom this Agreement applies has claimed an Australian benefit under this Agreement and has accumulated:

       * (a) a period as an Australian resident that is less than the period required to qualify that person, on that ground, under the legislation of Australia for that benefit; and

       * (b) a period of Australian working life residence equal to or greater than the period identified in accordance with paragraph 4 for that person; and

       * (c) a creditable period under the legislation of the Slovak Republic;

then, for the purposes of a claim for that Australian benefit, that creditable period shall be deemed to be a period in which that person was an Australian resident only for the purposes of meeting any minimum qualifying periods for that benefit set out in the legislation of Australia.

2.	For the purposes of paragraph 1, where a person:

       * (a) has been an Australian resident for a continuous period which is less than the minimum continuous period required by the legislation of Australia for entitlement of that person to a benefit; and

       * (b) has accumulated two or more separate creditable periods that equal or exceed in total the minimum period referred to in subparagraph (a);

the total of the creditable periods completed under the legislation of the Slovak Republic shall be deemed to be one continuous period.

3.	For the purposes of this Article, where a period by a person as an Australian resident and a creditable period completed under the legislation of the Slovak Republic coincide, the period of coincidence shall be taken into account once only by Australia as a period as an Australian resident.

4.	The minimum period of Australian working life residence to be taken into account for the purposes of paragraph 1 shall be as follows:

       * (a) for the purposes of an Australian benefit that is payable to a person who is not an Australian resident, the minimum period required shall be 12 months, of which at least six months must be continuous; and

       * (b) for the purposes of an Australian benefit that is payable to an Australian resident, there shall be no minimum period.

**Article 13**

Calculation of Benefits**

**1.	Where an Australian benefit is payable only by virtue of this Agreement to a person who is outside Australia, the rate of that benefit shall be determined according to the legislation of Australia. The additional child amount shall not be included in the calculation of such benefits.

2.	Where a person comes temporarily to Australia, paragraph 1 shall continue to apply for 26 weeks from the date of their arrival in Australia.

3.	Where an Australian benefit is payable only by virtue of this Agreement to a person who is in Australia, the rate of that benefit shall be determined by:

       * (a) calculating that person's income according to the legislation of Australia but disregarding in that calculation any Slovak Republic benefit which that person or the partner of that person is entitled to receive if applicable; and

       * (b) deducting the amount of the Slovak Republic benefit which that person is entitled to receive from the maximum rate of that Australian benefit; and

       * (c) applying to the remaining benefit obtained under subparagraph (b) the relevant rate calculation set out in the legislation of Australia, using as the person's income the amount calculated under subparagraph (a).

4.	Where a person departs temporarily from Australia, paragraph 3 shall continue to apply for 26 weeks from the date of their departure from Australia.

5.	Where a member of a couple is, or both that person and his or her partner are, entitled to a Slovak Republic benefit or benefits, each of them shall be deemed, for the purposes of this Article and of the legislation of Australia, to be in receipt of one half of that benefit or one half of the total of both benefits, as the case may be.

**Chapter 2**

Slovak Republic Benefits**

Article 14**

Totalisation**

**Unless otherwise provided in this Agreement, if a person is not eligible for a benefit because he or she has not completed sufficient creditable periods under the legislation of the Slovak Republic, the eligibility of that person for that benefit shall be determined by totalising these creditable periods and periods of Australian working life residence, provided those periods do not overlap.

**Article 15**

Calculation of Benefits**

**1.	If, under the legislation of the Slovak Republic, a person or the survivors of that person are eligible for a benefit without the need to totalise with periods of Australian working life residence and by only taking into account creditable periods completed under the legislation of the Slovak Republic, the Competent Institution of the Slovak Republic shall determine the amount of that benefit exclusively on the basis of that creditable period.

2.	If, under the legislation of the Slovak Republic, a person or the survivors of that person are eligible for a benefit only by totalising periods completed under the legislation of both Contracting Parties, the amount of that benefit shall be determined as follows:

       * (a) the Competent Institution of the Slovak Republic shall first determine whether, under the legislation of the Slovak Republic, the person satisfies the conditions for eligibility by taking into account the totalised periods;

       * (b) if the benefit is payable in accordance with subparagraph (a), the Competent Institution of the Slovak Republic shall first calculate the theoretical amount of the benefit payable as if the totalised periods completed under the legislation of both Contracting Parties had been completed under the legislation of the Slovak Republic alone;

       * (c) based on the theoretical amount of the benefit, the institution shall determine the amount of the benefit payable by calculating the proportion corresponding to the actual creditable periods completed under the legislation of the Slovak Republic and the totalised periods completed under the legislation of both Contracting Parties.

3.	If the creditable periods completed under the legislation of the Slovak Republic are less than 12 months, no benefit under this Agreement shall be paid. The preceding sentence shall not apply if a benefit is payable based on those creditable periods alone. 

4.	If, under the legislation of the Slovak Republic, the Competent Institution can determine the amount of benefit only on the basis of creditable periods acquired according to the legislation of the Slovak Republic, the provisions of paragraph 2 shall not apply.

5.	An invalidity pension for a person whose disability arose when the person was a dependent child, or while studying for a doctoral degree and under 26 years of age, shall be payable disregarding the length of the creditable period only if it concerns a person who is a permanent resident of the Slovak Republic.

**PART IV**

MISCELLANEOUS AND ADMINISTRATIVE PROVISIONS**

Article 16**

Lodgement of Documents**

**1.	A claim, notice or appeal concerning a benefit, whether payable by virtue of this Agreement or otherwise, may be lodged in the territory of either Contracting Party.

2.	For the purposes of determining the right to a benefit, the date on which a claim, notice or appeal referred to in paragraph 1 is lodged with the Competent Institution of one Contracting Party shall be considered as the date of lodgement of that document with the Competent Institution of the other Contracting Party. The Competent Institution with which a claim, notice or appeal is lodged shall refer it without delay to the Competent Institution of the other Contracting Party.

3.	A claim for a benefit in accordance with the legislation of one Contracting Party, submitted after this Agreement has entered into force, shall be deemed to be a claim for a corresponding benefit in accordance with the legislation of the second Contracting Party in these instances:

       * b)	if a person has stated in the claim that they had an affiliation with the social security system of the second Contracting Party.

4.	In relation to Australia, paragraph 3 shall only apply if the corresponding claim is received by the Competent Institution within twelve months of the lodgement of the original claim.

**Article 17**

Payment of Benefits**

**In the event that a Contracting Party imposes currency controls, that Contracting Party shall, without delay, take suitable measures to ensure the payment of any amount that must be paid in accordance with this Agreement to persons described in Article 3 who reside in the territory of the other Contracting Party.

**Article 18**

Exemption from Fees and Authentication**

**1.	Where the laws of a Contracting Party provide that any document which is submitted to the Competent Authority or the Competent Institution of that Contracting Party shall be exempted, wholly or partly, from fees or charges, including consular and administrative fees, the exemption shall also apply to corresponding documents which are submitted to the Competent Authority or Competent Institution of the other Contracting Party in the application of this Agreement.

       * (b) a period of Australian working life residence equal to or greater than the period specified in Article 13.4 for that person; and

       * (c) a creditable period under the legislation of the Republic of Hungary;

2.	For the purposes of Article 13.1, where a person:

       * (a) has been an Australian resident for a continuous period which is less than the minimum continuous period required by the legislation of Australia for entitlement of that person to a benefit; and

Calculation of Australian Benefits**

**1.	Subject to Article 14.2, where an Australian benefit is payable only by virtue of this Agreement to a person outside Australia, the rate of that benefit shall be determined according to the legislation of Australia, and proportionalised where applicable, but on the basis that the additional child amount is nil.

3.	Subject to Article 14.4, where an Australian benefit is payable only by virtue of this Agreement to a person who is in Australia, the rate of that benefit shall be determined by:

       * (b) deducting the amount of the benefit under the legislation of the Republic of Hungary which that person is entitled to receive from the maximum rate of that Australian benefit; and

PROVISIONS RELATING TO BENEFITS UNDER THE LEGISLATION OF THE REPUBLIC OF HUNGARY**

Article 15**

Residence in Australia may qualify a person for Hungarian benefits (Totalization)**

**1.	Where the legislation of the Republic of Hungary makes the acquisition, maintenance or recovery of eligibility for a benefit conditional upon the accumulation of creditable periods, if the criteria of eligibility for a benefit are not met solely under the legislation of the Republic of Hungary, the Competent Institution of the Republic of Hungary shall take into account the creditable periods completed under the legislation of Australia as if these periods were completed under its own legislation, provided that such creditable periods do not overlap.

2.	Where the legislation of the Republic of Hungary makes the granting of certain benefits conditional upon the creditable periods completed only in an occupation which is subject to a special scheme, or the eligibility to these benefits is subject to condition of creditable periods completed in specific occupations or employment, periods completed under the legislation of Australia shall only be taken into account for the granting of these benefits if these were completed under a corresponding scheme or, for lack of this scheme, in similar occupation or employment. If the totalization of creditable periods does not establish eligibility to a benefit within the specific scheme of benefits, these creditable periods shall be totalized within the general scheme of insurance.

3.	Where eligibility to a full benefit is acquired under the legislation of the Republic of Hungary without the application of paragraphs 1 and 2 of this Article, the benefit shall be defined by the Competent Institution of the Republic of Hungary only on the basis of creditable periods completed under the legislation which it applies.

4.	Once the Hungarian pension has been awarded the accumulation of additional creditable periods under the legislation of Australia shall not result in the revision of the Hungarian pension.

**Article 16**

Calculating the amount of Hungarian partial benefits**

**Where a person is entitled to a full benefit under the legislation of the Republic of Hungary only on the basis of totalising creditable periods, the Competent Institution of the Republic of Hungary shall calculate the amount of pension to be paid, as if all creditable periods acquired under the legislation of both Contracting Parties were taken into account for the establishment of the pension. The Competent Institution of the Republic of Hungary shall pay only the proportion of the pension calculated by this calculating method that corresponds to the ratio of creditable periods completed under the legislation of the Republic of Hungary to the total creditable periods under the legislation of both Contracting Parties.

**Article 17**

The basis of calculation of benefits**

**Where under the legislation of the Republic of Hungary the benefits are calculated on the basis of income and contributions paid, the Competent Institution of the Republic of Hungary shall take into account only the income or contributions paid under the legislation which it applies.

**Article 18**

Creditable period less than 1 year**

**Where the total creditable periods completed under the legislation of the Republic of Hungary is less than 365 days, provided that no eligibility to benefits is established only on the basis of this creditable period, the Competent Institution of the Republic of Hungary shall not apply totalisation and shall not grant any benefit for a period shorter than 365 days.

**Article 19**

Concurrence of benefits**

**1.	In relation to the Republic of Hungary, the legislation which excludes or limits eligibility to benefits or benefits in the case of concurrence of eligibility, benefits or incomes, shall be applied as appropriate to cases arising from the application of the legislation of Australia.

2.	In relation to the Republic of Hungary, it shall not be possible to acquire or to maintain eligibility to several benefits or incomes of similar type based on the same mandatory insurance period in keeping with this Agreement. This shall not apply to benefits for invalidity, old age or death.
