    * (3C) If the person's entitlement arose under section 78, the annual rate of salary payable to the person at the later time is taken to be the amount per annum that would, if the person had ceased to be an eligible employee on the day immediately before the day on which the person's entitlement arose, have been the person's final annual rate of salary at the time (the **_earlier time_**) that would have been the occasion of the person's so ceasing to be an eligible employee.

    * (3E) If, at any time, whether before or after the commencement of this subsection, the Australian Statistician has published or publishes for a particular period an estimate of a change (including an estimate that no change has occurred) in AWOTE in substitution for an estimate of such a change for that period previously published by the Australian Statistician, the publication of the later estimate is to be disregarded for the purposes of this section.

    * (4) Where the rate of the salary, or of a part of the salary, of an eligible employee is not an annual rate, the amount per annum of that salary, or of that part of that salary, as the case may be, shall, for the purposes of this section, be ascertained:

    * (5) If, because of subsection (1), this Act has a separate operation in respect of a person in relation to any employment, the person may elect, by notice in writing to CSC, that that subsection applies to him or her in respect of that employment before the commencement of this section and, where such an election is made, that subsection is taken to have been in force in relation to the person during the period of that employment.

##### 45  Basic contributions

    * (1) Subject to subsection 3(3) and sections 51, 51A and 54, an eligible employee shall pay fortnightly basic contributions.

         * Note: The amount of fortnightly basic contributions payable might be nil (see subsection 46(2)).

    * (2) Subject to subsection (3), the first fortnightly basic contribution of an eligible employee is payable:

      * (a) in the case of an eligible employee who, immediately before the commencing day, was an employee for the purposes of the superseded Act--on the contribution day next following the commencing day; and

      * (b) in any other case--on the contribution day next following the day on which the person became an eligible employee;

    * and subsequent basic contributions are payable on each succeeding contribution day during the period during which the person continues to be an eligible employee.

    * (3) Where an eligible employee (not being an eligible employee referred to in paragraph (2)(a) who was an existing contributor) dies, or retires on the ground of invalidity, before the day on which, but for his or her death or retirement, his or her first fortnightly basic contribution would have been payable, that contribution shall be deemed to have become payable by him or her on the day on which he or she became an eligible employee.

##### 46  Amount of basic contribution

    * (1) The amount of the fortnightly basic contribution payable by an eligible employee on a contribution day is an amount equal to 5 per centum of the fortnightly rate of salary that was payable (or is deemed by section 47 to have been payable) to the employee on the anniversary of his or her birth last preceding that contribution day or, if that amount is not a multiple of 10 cents, the next higher amount that is such a multiple.

    * (2) However, an eligible employee may elect that the amount of the fortnightly basic contribution payable by the employee is an amount equal to 0% of the fortnightly rate of salary referred to in subsection (1).

         * Note: The election is suspended during some periods of leave of absence without pay of more than 12 weeks (see sections 51A and 51AA).

##### 47  Decreases in salary

    * (1) If, on an anniversary of an eligible employee's birth (in this subsection referred to as the **_relevant anniversary_**), his or her annual rate of salary is less than the highest annual rate of salary that was payable (or is deemed by a previous application of this subsection, or by subsection (3), to have been payable) to him or her on any day during the period commencing on the anniversary of his or her birth last preceding the relevant anniversary and ending on the day immediately preceding the relevant anniversary, his or her annual rate of salary on the relevant anniversary shall, unless he or she has made or makes an election under subsection (2) by virtue of a decrease in his or her annual rate of salary that occurred during that period, be deemed, for the purposes of section 46, and any subsequent application of this subsection, to be such rate as is relevant to the eligible employee under the regulations or if there is no such rate:

      * (a) where paragraph (b) does not apply--that highest annual rate of salary; or

      * (b) where, if:

       * (i) there had not been any decrease in his or her annual rate of salary during the period beginning immediately after the last day on which that highest annual rate of salary was payable to him or her and ending on the relevant anniversary; and

      * the annual rate of salary of the eligible employee on the relevant anniversary (in this paragraph called the**_ imputed annual rate of salary_**) would be higher than that highest annual rate of salary--that imputed annual rate of salary.

    * (2) If the annual rate of salary payable to an eligible employee decreases, the employee may, not later than 3 months after the anniversary of his or her birth next following the date of the decrease, elect, by notice in writing to CSC, that subsection (1) shall not apply in relation to his or her annual salary on that anniversary of his or her birth.

    * (3) Where:

      * (a) an eligible employee makes an election under subsection (2) by virtue of a decrease in his or her annual rate of salary; and

      * (b) the annual rate of his or her salary on the anniversary of his or her birth next following the date of the decrease is less than the highest annual rate of salary that was payable to him or her on any day during the period commencing on the date of the decrease and ending on the day immediately preceding that anniversary;

    * the annual rate of his or her salary on that anniversary shall, for the purposes of section 46 and subsection (1) of this section, be deemed to be such rate as is relevant to the eligible employee under the regulations or if there is no such rate:

      * (c) where paragraph (d) does not apply--that highest annual rate of salary; or

      * (d) where, if:

       * (ii) his or her annual rate of salary had been increased during the period by the same percentage as any overall percentage increase in AWOTE that occurred over the period (being an overall percentage increase worked out from estimates of changes in AWOTE in respect of the period published by the Australian Statistician, other than estimates published in substitution for earlier estimates);

      * the annual rate of salary of the eligible employee on the relevant anniversary (in this paragraph called the **_imputed annual rate of salary_**) would be higher than that highest annual rate of salary--that imputed annual rate of salary.

    * (4) Where:

      * (a) an eligible employee makes an election under subsection (2) by virtue of a decrease in his or her annual rate of salary;

      * (b) the annual rate of salary payable to him or her immediately after the decrease is less than the rate of salary that was payable (or is deemed by subsection (1) or (3) to have been payable) to him or her on the anniversary of his or her birth last preceding the date of the decrease; and

      * (c) the election is made before the anniversary of his or her birth next following the date of the decrease;

    * the annual rate of his or her salary on the anniversary of his or her birth last preceding the date of the decrease shall, for the purpose of calculating the amount of the basic contribution payable by him or her on each contribution day occurring after the date of the election and before the anniversary of his or her birth next following that date, be deemed to be the annual rate of his or her salary immediately after the decrease.

#### Division 4A--Early release of benefits

##### 79A  Definitions

    * (1) In this Division:

    * **_available early release amount_**, in relation to a person at a particular time, means the difference between the person's early release amount at that time and the person's early release deduction amount at that time.

    * **_compassionate ground _**has the same meaning as in regulation 6.01 of the _Superannuation Industry (Supervision) Regulations 1994_.

    * **_deferred benefit member _**means a person, who has ceased to be an eligible employee, to or in respect of whom a deferred benefit has not been paid.

    * **_early release amount_**, in relation to a person at a particular time, means the sum of the following amounts:

      * (a) the person's accumulated basic contributions;

      * (b) the person's accumulated supplementary contributions;

      * (c) the person's accumulated employer contributions (disregarding any amounts mentioned in paragraphs 110Q(1)(c) and (d));

      * (d) the amount (if any) payable in respect of the person under section 110SN;

      * (e) the amount of the benefit payable to the person under Subdivision B of Division 2 of Part IX.

         * Note: This definition is affected by subsection (2).

    * **_early release deduction amount_**, in relation to a person at a particular time, means the total of the following:

      * (a) the amount of each early release lump sum previously paid to or for the benefit of the person;

      * (b) interest on the amount of each such early release lump sum for the period beginning at the time the early release lump sum is paid and ending at the particular time.

    * **_early release lump sum _**has the meaning given by section 79B.

    * **_severe financial hardship _**has the same meaning as in regulation 6.01 of the _Superannuation Industry (Supervision) Regulations 1994_.

    * (2) For the purposes of the definition of **_early release amount_**, work out the sum of the amounts referred to in that definition:

      * (a) in the case of an eligible employee--as if the person ceased to be an eligible employee at that time; or

      * (b) in the case of a deferred benefit member--as if the person ceased to be a deferred benefit member at that time; or

      * (c) in the case of a person who has made an election under section 110T--as if the person's benefit became payable at that time.

         * Note: The components that make up a person's early release amount might be reduced if CSC has received, under Part IXB (family law superannuation splitting), a splitting agreement or splitting order in relation to the person's superannuation interest.

##### 79B  Early release of benefits

    * (1) For the purposes of the _Superannuation Industry (Supervision) Regulations 1994_, a lump sum (the **_early release lump sum_**) may be paid, on the grounds of severe financial hardship or on compassionate grounds, in accordance with those regulations, to or for the benefit of the following persons:

      * (a) an eligible employee;

      * (b) a deferred benefit member;

      * (c) a person who has made an election under section 110T (postponement of benefits).

         * Note: The components that make up the person's early release amount are not reduced when an early release lump sum is paid. However, when a benefit to which the person is entitled under this Act becomes payable to the person, the amount of the benefit is reduced to reflect any previous early release lump sums paid to or for the benefit of the person (see section 79D).

    * (2) To avoid doubt, more than one early release lump sum can be paid to or for the benefit of a person.

    * Benefit does not become payable

    * (3) For the purposes of this Act, merely because an early release lump sum becomes payable to or for the benefit of a person does not mean a benefit to which the person is entitled under this Act becomes payable.

##### 79D  Calculation of benefits after payment of early release lump sums

    * (1) This section applies if:

      * (a) an early release lump sum is paid to or for the benefit of a person; and

      * (b) a benefit to which the person is entitled under this Act becomes payable to the person at a particular time.

    * (2) The amount of the benefit to which the person is entitled to be paid at that time must be reduced to reflect the person's early release deduction amount at that time. However, the method of working out the amount of the reduction is to be determined by CSC.
