##### 100C  Contributions for pension by relevant employee

    * (1) This Division applies to a relevant employee if the employee was, immediately before he became an employee for the purposes of this Act, a member of a superannuation scheme under which:

     * (a) benefits by way of a pension or of a lump sum were payable to a member of the scheme upon the cessation of his employment by reason of his having attained a specified age, being a pension or lump sum the amount of which was related to the salary payable to him immediately before the cessation of his employment;

     * (b) if the superannuation scheme of which a prescribed employee was a member immediately before the relevant date was a scheme under which members were not required to make contributions in respect of the benefits to be provided under the scheme--the employee shall be deemed to be a contributor to the Fund for so many units of pension (including, where necessary, a fraction of a unit) as the Board determines will entitle him to benefits equivalent to those to which he would have been entitled if he had continued to be a member of that superannuation scheme and had continued to be remunerated at the rate at which he was being remunerated immediately before the relevant date, and he is not required to make any contributions for those units of pension.

    * (4) Where the number of units of pension for which a prescribed employee is, upon becoming an employee for the purposes of this Act, liable to contribute to the Fund by virtue of section 20 exceeds the number of units of pension for which he is liable to contribute, or is to be deemed to be a contributor, to the Fund by virtue of subsection (3) that subsection does not affect his liability to contribute for the excess (in this subsection referred to as the additional units of pension), but, if he attained the age of 40 years before the relevant date, section 20A applies to and in relation to those additional units of pension as if they were units of pension for which he is required to contribute by reason of an increase in his salary since the attainment by him of the age of 40 years.

    * (5) Where, immediately before the relevant date, the benefits for which a prescribed employee was entitled to contribute to the superannuation scheme applicable to him exceeded the benefits for which he was contributing to that scheme:

     * (a) subsection (4) applies in relation to him as if the reference to the number of units of pension for which he is liable to contribute or is to be deemed to be a contributor to the Fund by virtue of subsection (3) were a reference to the number of units of pension (including, where necessary, a fraction of a unit) determined by the Board to be the number of units that will entitle him to benefits equivalent to those firstmentioned benefits; and

     * (b) subject to subsection (6), he may, at any time while he is a contributor to the Fund, but not later than 12 February 1976, elect to contribute to the Fund for so many additional units of pension (including, where necessary, a fraction of a unit) as the Board determines to be the number of units that will entitle him to benefits equivalent to that excess.

    * (6) An election under paragraph (b) of subsection (5) does not have effect in relation to a prescribed employee unless, not later than 6 months after the date on which the election is made, he satisfies the Board that he is not suffering from any physical or mental defect (not being a defect that, in the opinion of the Board, is a result of the service of the employee as a member of the Forces as defined in subsection (2) of section 147) likely to render him incapable of performing his duties before he attains the maximum age for retirement.

    * (7) A prescribed employee to whom this section applies shall, for the purposes of this Act, be deemed to be a contributor:

     * (b) in any other case--at rates based on a retiring age of 65 years.

    * (10) Nothing in this Act shall be taken to require or permit a reduction in the number of units of pension for which a prescribed employee is a contributor to a number that is less than the number of units of pension for which he is liable to contribute or for which he is to be deemed to be a contributor, under subsection (3).

##### 100D  Payment of prescribed amount to Board

     * (a) there is payable out of the Fund to or in relation to that prescribed employee, in addition to that refund of contributions, an amount equal to the amount that was paid by the Board to the Commonwealth in accordance with subparagraph (ii) of paragraph (a) of section 100D or with paragraph (b) of that section, as the case requires; and

    * (3) If at any time the number of units of pension for which a relevant employee to whom this section applies would, but for this section, be required by section 20 to contribute to the Fund exceeds the number of units of pension determined by the Board for the purposes of subsection (2) of this section, the employee shall not be required or permitted to contribute to the Fund at that time in respect of a number of units of pension greater than the excess.

    * (4) In the application of Division 2 of Part XA to and in relation to a relevant employee to whom this section applies, a reference in that Division to the number of units of pension for which he would, but for that Division, be required to contribute to the Fund shall be read as a reference to the number of units of pension ascertained by subtracting from the number of units of pension for which he would, but for this section and for that Division, be required to contribute to the Fund, the number of units of pension determined by the Board for the purposes of subsection (2).

#### Division 2--The Superannuation Fund

##### 107B  Definition

    * In this Division, unless the contrary intention appears, **_prescribed employee_** means a State employee who has made an election, and a payment to the Board, in accordance with subsection (2) of section 107C.

##### 107C  Contributions for pension by State employees

    * (1) This Division does not apply to a State employee whose contributions to the State Fund were of a similar nature to contributions under this Act to the Provident Account.

    * (2) A State employee may elect, within 3 months after the relevant date or within such further period as the Board allows, to contribute to the Fund in accordance with this section and may pay to the Board an amount equal to the prescribed amount within that period or within such further period as the Board allows, but any election made after the payday last preceding 1 July 1976 shall be deemed to have been made on that payday.

    * (3) Notwithstanding section 5, a prescribed employee shall be liable to make, and, from and including the relevant date, shall be deemed to have been liable to make, contributions to the Fund for so many units of pension (including, where necessary, a fraction of a unit) as the Board determines to be the number of units that will entitle him to benefits equivalent to those to which he would have been entitled if he had continued to contribute to the State Fund at the rate at which he was contributing to the State Fund immediately before the relevant date, and his contributions for those units of pension shall be at that rate.

    * (4) Where a prescribed employee had, in accordance with the law of the State concerned, deferred making certain contributions to the State Fund:

     * (a) the number of units of pension to be determined by the Board under subsection (3) in relation to him shall include so many units of pension (including, where necessary, a fraction of a unit) as the Board determines to be the number of units that will entitle him to benefits equivalent to those to which he would have become entitled, under the law of the State as in force immediately before the relevant date, if he had continued to contribute to the State Fund and had paid those deferred contributions, together with any interest payable in respect of those deferred contributions, in accordance with that law as so in force; and

     * (b) pension is not payable in respect of the units of pension determined in accordance with paragraph (a) unless and until there has been paid to the Fund, or, on or after 1 July 1976, to the new Superannuation Fund, for the purposes of this subsection, an amount equal to the sum of the contributions and interest that would, if the employee had continued to be a contributor to the State Fund and had ceased to be such a contributor on the day on which he ceases to be a contributor to the Fund, have been payable to the State Fund in relation to those deferred contributions for the purpose of enabling benefits to be payable in respect of those deferred contributions.

    * (5) Where the number of units of pension for which a prescribed employee is, upon becoming an employee for the purposes of this Act, liable to contribute to the Fund by virtue of section 20 exceeds the number of units of pension for which he is liable to contribute to the Fund by virtue of subsection (3) of this section, that subsection does not affect his liability to contribute for the excess (in this subsection referred to as **_additional units of pension_**), but, if he attained the age of 40 years before the relevant date section 20A applies to and in relation to those additional units of pension as if they were additional units of pension for which he is required to contribute by reason of an increase in his salary since the attainment by him of the age of 40 years.

    * (6) Where, immediately before the relevant date, the benefits for which a prescribed employee was entitled to contribute to the State Fund exceeded the benefits for which he was contributing to that fund:

     * (a) subsection (5) applies in relation to him as if the reference to the number of units of pension for which he is liable to contribute to the Fund by virtue of subsection (3) were a reference to the number of units of pension (including, where necessary, a fraction of a unit) determined by the Board to be the number of units that will entitle him to benefits equivalent to those firstmentioned benefits; and

     * (b) subject to subsection (7), he may, at any time while he is a contributor to the Fund, but not later than 12 February 1976, elect to contribute to the Fund for so many additional units of pension (including, where necessary, a fraction of a unit) as the Board determines to be the number of units that will entitle him to benefits equivalent to that excess.

    * (7) An election under paragraph (b) of subsection (6) does not have effect in relation to a prescribed employee unless, not later than 6 months after the date on which the election is made, he satisfies the Board that he is not suffering from any physical or mental defect (not being a defect that, in the opinion of the Board, is the result of the service of the employee as a member of the Forces as defined in subsection (2) of section 147) likely to render him incapable of performing his duties before attaining the maximum age for retirement.

    * (8) A prescribed employee shall, for the purposes of this Act, be deemed to be a contributor:

     * (a) in the case of an employee who contributed to the State Fund for pension on retirement at the age of 60 years or of a female employee who contributed to the State Fund for pension on retirement at the age of 55 years--at rates based on a retiring age of 60 years; or

     * (b) in any other case--at rates based on a retiring age of 65 years.

    * (9) Subject to subsection (10), where at any time, the number of units of pension for which a prescribed employee is liable to contribute under subsection (3) exceeds the number of units of pension for which the employee would, apart from that subsection, be required to contribute under section 20, the employee is not entitled to contribute for any units, other than reserve units, in excess of the firstmentioned number of units.

    * (10) Notwithstanding subsection (9) of this section, section 20B applies, subject to subsection (11) of this section, to and in relation to a prescribed employee in respect of a reduction of his salary or of the prescribed amount referred to in section 20.

    * (11) Nothing in this Act shall be taken to require or permit a reduction in the number of units of pension for which a prescribed employee is a contributor to a number that is less than the number of units of pension for which he is liable to contribute under subsection (3).

    * (12) For the purposes of this section, a reference to the rate at which a prescribed employee was contributing to the State Fund does not include the rate of any contributions that were being paid by him to the State Fund in relation to an amount of a kind referred to in paragraph (a), (b) or (c) of the definition of **_prescribed amount_** in subsection (1) of section 107A.

##### 107D  Prescribed employees contributing for restricted benefits

    * (1) Where a prescribed employee was contributing to the State Fund for benefits declared by the regulations to be restricted benefits:

     * (a) benefits in respect of the units of pension for which he is liable to contribute under this Act are only payable to or in relation to him in the circumstances in which benefits would have been payable to or in relation to him out of the State Fund under the law of the State as in force at the relevant date if he had continued to contribute to the State Fund for those restricted benefits; and

     * (b) the benefits that are payable in respect of those units to or in relation to him in any such circumstances are the benefits determined by the Board to be the equivalent of the benefits that would be payable to or in relation to him out of the State Fund under the law of the State as in force at the relevant date if he had continued to contribute to the State Fund for those restricted benefits at the same rate as the rate at which he was contributing for them immediately before the relevant date.

    * (2) Subsection (1) does not apply to a prescribed employee who has satisfied the Board that he is not suffering from any physical or mental defect likely to render him incapable of performing his duties before attaining the maximum age for retirement.

##### 107E  Prescribed amount paid to Board

    * Upon the payment by a prescribed employee to the Board under subsection (2) of section 107C of an amount equal to the prescribed amount:

     * (a) an amount equal to so much of the prescribed amount as was based upon the contributions made by him to the State Fund or on interest payable in respect of those contributions shall be paid by the Board to the Fund, or, on or after 1 July 1976, to the new Superannuation Fund, and, when so paid, shall be deemed, for the purposes of this Act, to be contributions made to the Fund by the prescribed employee; and

     * (b) an amount equal to so much (if any) of the prescribed amount as was not based upon contributions made by him to the State Fund shall be paid by the Board to the Commonwealth.

##### 107F  Refunds of contributions to prescribed employees

    * In the application of Division 2 of Part XA to and in relation to a prescribed employee, a reference in that Division to the number of units of pension for which he would, but for that Division, be required to contribute to the Fund shall be read as not including the number of units of pension for which he is contributing to the Fund by virtue of subsection (3), or paragraph (b) of subsection (6), of section 107C.

##### 107H  Increased contributions by the Commonwealth

    * Where a pension becomes payable to or in relation to a prescribed employee, each payment that is required by section 33 to be made by the Commonwealth to the Fund in respect of that prescribed employee shall be increased by such amount (if any) as the Board determines to be necessary by reason of the prescribed employee having contributed to the Fund at rates less than those at which, but for this Part, he would have been required to contribute.

##### 107J  Certain amounts to be paid by the Commonwealth to the Fund

    * Where, within 5 years after the relevant date, a prescribed employee is retired on the ground of invalidity or of physical or mental incapacity to perform his duties or a prescribed employee dies, and a pension is payable to or in relation to him, the pension shall be paid from the Fund and there is payable to the Fund out of the Consolidated Revenue Fund an amount equal to the amount by which the proportion of each payment of the pension equivalent to the contributions made by or in respect of the prescribed employee is less than the proportion of each payment of the pension that is payable otherwise than by the Commonwealth under section 33.

    * (2) If at any time the number of units of pension for which a State employee to whom this section applies would, but for this section, be required by section 20 to contribute to the Fund does not exceed the number of units of pension (including, where necessary, a fraction of a unit) determined by the Board to be the number of units of pension that would entitle that employee to benefits equivalent to the benefits to which he would be entitled under the law of the State as in force at the relevant date if he had continued to contribute to the State Fund at the rate at which he was contributing to the State Fund immediately before the relevant date, the employee shall not be required or permitted to contribute to the Fund at that time in respect of units of pension.

    * (3) If at any time the number of units of pension for which a State employee to whom this section applies would, but for this section, be required by section 20 to contribute to the Fund exceeds the number of units of pension determined by the Board for the purpose of subsection (2), the employee shall not be required or permitted to contribute to the Fund at that time in respect of a number of units of pension greater than the excess.

    * (4) In the application of Division 2 of Part XA to and in relation to a State employee to whom this section applies, a reference in that Division to the number of units of pension for which he would, but for that Division, be required to contribute to the Fund shall be read as a reference to the number of units of pension ascertained by subtracting from the number of units of pension for which he would, but for this section and for that Division, be required to contribute to the Fund the number of units of pension determined by the Board for the purpose of subsection (2).

      * (iii) the employee underwent a medical examination required by the person by whom he was employed in the employment referred to in paragraph (a) for the purpose of determining whether his health and physical fitness were of such a standard as would justify his being employed in that employment.

     * (a) the benefits that would have been applicable in respect of the employee if the termination of that employment had been caused by his death, invalidity or physical or mental incapacity would have been, or would have included, benefits by way of a pension;

     * (a) in the case of a person other than a person in relation to whom paragraph (b) applies--the period of three months immediately after he ceased to be such a contributor; or

     * (b) in the case of a person who ceased to be such a contributor by reason of his having voluntarily terminated his employment or service in order to become a candidate for election as a member of a House of the Parliament of Australia or of a State or of the Legislative Assembly of the Northern Territory or a legislative or advisory body for another Territory prescribed for the purposes of section 47C of the _Public Service Act 19221974_ and was a candidate at the election:

      * (ii) if he is not elected--the period of three months immediately after the day of the declaration of the result of the election.

    * (2) Subject to subsection (3):

     * (a) a period in respect of which a pension was payable to a person under this Act by reason of his invalidity or of his physical or mental incapacity to perform the duties of his employment and immediately before the commencement of which he was employed in public employment shall be treated for the purposes of this Division as if it had been a period in which he was employed in public employment; and

     * (b) a period in respect of which a pension was payable to a person under a superannuation scheme applicable in respect of any employment of the person (other than the superannuation scheme constituted by the provisions of this Act relating to the Fund) by reason of his invalidity or of his physical or mental incapacity to perform the duties of that employment and immediately before the commencement of which he was employed in that employment shall be treated for the purposes of this Division as if it had been a period in which he was employed in that employment.

    * that period shall be treated for the purposes of this Division as if it had been a period in which that pension was payable but, if the person was, immediately before the pension became payable, employed in public employment, shall not, in the calculation of the period during which he was employed in public employment, be treated, by reason of paragraph (a) of subsection (2), as if it had been a period during which he was employed in public employment.

    * **_halfyear_** means a period of 6 months beginning on 1 January or 1 July in any year.

    * **_pension_** includes a pension payable by virtue of section 9 or 14 of the _Superannuation Act (No. 2) 1956 _or section 10 of the _Superannuation (Pension Increases) Act 1971_, but does not include:

    * **_prescribed halfyear_** means the halfyear commencing on 1 January 2002 or a subsequent halfyear.

    * **_Statistician_** means the Australian Statistician.

    * (2) Subject to subsection (3), if at any time, whether before or after the commencement of this section, the Statistician has published or publishes in respect of a particular first quarter in a halfyear an all groups consumer price index number for the weighted average of the 8 capital cities in substitution for an index number previously published by him in respect of that quarter, the publication of the later index number shall be disregarded for the purposes of this Part.

    * (3) If at any time, whether before or after the commencement of this section, the Statistician has changed or changes the reference base for the Consumer Price Index, then, for the purposes of the application of this Part after the change took place or takes place, regard shall be had only to index numbers published in terms of the new reference base.

    * (2) The increase provided for by subsection (1) in the rate at which a pension was payable to a person immediately before the commencement of a prescribed halfyear is the prescribed percentage of that rate.

    * **A--B** expressed as a percentage of **B**, where:
