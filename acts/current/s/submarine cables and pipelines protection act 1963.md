##### 3  Saving of other laws

   * (1) This Act shall be read and construed as being in addition to and not in derogation of or in substitution for any other law of the Commonwealth or of a State or Territory. 

   * (2) The reference in the last preceding subsection to a law of the Commonwealth includes a reference to the Imperial Act known as the Submarine Telegraph Act, 1885, insofar as that Act is part of the law of the Commonwealth.

    * (b) that is not a submarine cable (within the meaning of Schedule 3A to the _Telecommunications Act 1997_) in a protection zone (within the meaning of that Schedule).

   * (2) In subsection (1):

   * **_high seas_** has the same meaning as in the United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea done at Montego Bay on 10 December 1982.

##### 5A  Application of the Criminal Code

   * Chapter 2 of the _Criminal Code_ applies to all offences created by this Act.

     * Note: Chapter 2 of the _Criminal Code_ sets out the general principles of criminal responsibility.

##### 7  Persons not to break or injure submarine cables or pipelines

   * (1) A person commits an offence if the person engages in conduct and the conduct results in a ship registered in Australia or in a Territory breaking or injuring:

    * (b) a submarine pipeline; or

    * (c) a submarine high-voltage cable.

     * Penalty: $1,000, or imprisonment for 3 months.

   * (2) Where:

    * (a) a breakage of, or an injury to, a cable or pipeline is caused by persons acting with the sole object of saving their lives or their ships; and

    * (b) those persons took all necessary precautions to avoid breaking or injuring the cable or pipeline,

   * the last preceding subsection does not apply in relation to the break or injury. 

   * (3) In this section:

   * **_engage in conduct_** means:

    * (a) do an act; or

    * (b) omit to perform an act.

##### 8  Liability for breaking or injuring a cable or pipeline

   * If a person, in the course of laying or repairing a submarine cable or pipeline of which he or she is the owner, causes a break in or injury to another cable or pipeline, he or she is liable to bear the cost of repairing the break or injury. 

##### 9  Indemnity for loss of anchor etc

   * If, after all reasonable precautionary measures have been taken, an anchor, a net or any other fishing gear belonging to a ship is sacrificed in order to avoid injuring a submarine cable or pipeline, the owner of the ship is entitled to be indemnified for his or her loss by the owner of the cable or pipeline. 

##### 10  Punishment of offences

   * (1) An offence against this Act may be prosecuted either summarily or upon indictment, but an offender is not liable to be punished more than once in respect of the same offence.
