##### 1  Transfer of national standards and codes of practice

  * A national standard or code of practice that is in force under the _Australian Workplace Safety Standards Act 2005_ immediately before the commencement of this item, is taken, on and after that commencement, to be a national standard or code of practice declared by Safe Work Australia under item 2 of this Schedule.

##### 2  Function and power to declare national standards and codes of practice

  * (1) It is a function of Safe Work Australia to declare national standards and codes of practice relating to occupational health and safety matters.

  * (2) Safe Work Australia may, by written instrument, declare a national standard or code of practice in relation to an occupational health and safety matter.

  * (3) Before declaring a national standard or code of practice, Safe Work Australia must consult in accordance with item 3 of this Schedule.

  * (4) As soon as practicable after Safe Work Australia declares a national standard or code of practice, it must publish in the _Gazette_:

     * (a) the title and objective of the standard or code; and

     * (b) information as to how people may obtain a copy of the standard or code.

  * (5) Safe Work Australia must, as soon as practicable after declaring a national standard or code of practice, give a copy of the standard or code to the Minister.

  * (6) A national standard or code of practice is an instrument of an advisory character and is not a legislative instrument.

##### 3  Steps preparatory to declaring national standards and codes of practice

  * _Gazettal notice_

  * _(1)	Before declaring a national standard or code of practice under item 2 of this Schedule, Safe Work Australia must publish a notice in the _Gazette_ inviting people to make comments on the proposed standard or code.

  * (2) The notice must:

     * (a) set out the title and objective of the proposed standard or code; and

     * (b) set out information as to how people may obtain a copy of the proposed standard or code; and

     * (c) invite people to make comments on the proposed standard or code; and

     * (d) specify the date by which comments must be received, which must be at least 4 weeks after the notice is published; and

     * (e) specify the address to which those comments must be sent.

  * _Other invitations for comment_

  * _(3)	In addition to the notice under subitem (1), Safe Work Australia may use other means to invite a person, or people generally, to make comments on the proposed standard or code. The invitation must:

     * (a) specify the date by which comments must be received, which must be at least 4 weeks after the date of the invitation; and

     * (b) specify the address to which those comments must be sent.

  * (4) If Safe Work Australia gives an invitation under subitem (3), Safe Work Australia must:

     * (a) notify each person who, before the invitation, has already made comments on the proposed standard or code of that invitation; and

     * (b) give the person the opportunity to revise the person's comments within 4 weeks after the date of the notice.

  * (5) However, Safe Work Australia is only required to give one notice to the person in relation to the proposed standard or code.

  * _Consideration of comments_

  * _(6)	Safe Work Australia must consider any comments made to it and, if it thinks fit, may alter the proposed standard or code.

##### 4  Cessation of function and power to declare national standards and codes of practice

  * (1) In this item:

  * **_cessation date_** means 1 January 2011 or such other earlier or later date that is prescribed by the regulations.

  * (2) On and after the cessation date, Safe Work Australia no longer has the functions or powers referred to in items 2 and 3 of this Schedule.

  * (3) However, a national standard or code of practice declared by Safe Work Australia under item 2 of this Schedule, that is in force immediately before the cessation date, continues in force on and after the cessation date.

##### 5  First plans of Safe Work Australia

  * (1) Safe Work Australia must prepare the first draft strategic plan mentioned in section 27 of the _Safe Work Australia Act 2008_ as soon as practicable after the commencement of that section.

##### 7  Regulations

  * (1) The Governor-General may make regulations prescribing matters:

     * (a) required or permitted by this Act to be prescribed; or

     * (b) necessary or convenient to be prescribed for carrying out or giving effect to this Act.

  * (2) In particular, regulations may be made prescribing matters of a transitional nature (including prescribing any saving or application provisions) relating to:
