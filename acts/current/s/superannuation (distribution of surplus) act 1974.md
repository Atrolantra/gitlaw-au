    * (a) the amount available for distribution to or in respect of eligible contributors is the amount of $52,525,000; and

    * (b) the amount available for distribution to or in respect of eligible pensioners is the amount of $17,490,000.

  * (2) As soon as practicable after the date has been fixed in accordance with paragraph (1)(a), the Board shall:

    * (b) allocate among eligible contributors, in such manner as the Treasurer, after receiving advice from the actuary, determines, the amount nearest to the relevant amount that it is practicable to allocate in that manner among eligible contributors.

     * (i) the amount available for distribution to or in respect of eligible pensioners; and

     * (ii) an amount determined by the Treasurer, after receiving advice from the Board, to be the amount that will have accrued to the Fund in respect of the period that commenced on 1 July 1972 and ends on the date so fixed by reason of the retention in the Fund during that period of the amount available for distribution to or in respect of eligible pensioners; and

  * (2) Where an eligible contributor or eligible pensioner who is entitled to an amount under the allocation made under subsection 5(2) or (3), as the case may be, has died before the time of payment of the amount:

    * (a) if the widow of the contributor or pensioner is alive at the time of payment--an amount equal to the amount to which the contributor or pensioner is so entitled shall be paid out of the Fund to that widow; or

    * (b) in any other case--an amount equal to, or amounts aggregating, the amount to which the contributor or pensioner is so entitled shall be paid out of the Fund to such person (if any), or to such persons (if any), as the case requires, as the Board determines.

##### 7  Assignment and attachment of amounts payable
