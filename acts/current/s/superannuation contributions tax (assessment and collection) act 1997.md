### An Act relating to the assessment and collection of superannuation contributions tax, and for related purposes


### Part 1--Preliminary

    * 1**  Short title **[_see_ Note 1]

    * This Act may be cited as the _Superannuation Contributions Tax (Assessment and Collection) Act 1997_.

    * 2**  Commencement **[_see_ Note 1]

    * This Act commences on the day on which it receives the Royal Assent.

##### 3  Act to bind Crown

    * (1) This Act binds the Crown in right of the Commonwealth, of each of the States, of the Australian Capital Territory, of the Northern Territory and of Norfolk Island.

    * (2) Nothing in this Act permits the Crown to be prosecuted for an offence.

##### 4  Extension to Territories

    * This Act extends to Norfolk Island, the Territory of Cocos (Keeling) Islands and the Territory of Christmas Island.

##### 5  Object of Act

    * The object of this Act is to provide for the assessment and collection of the superannuation contributions surcharge payable on surchargeable contributions for high-income individuals.

##### 6  Simplified outline of Act

    * The following is a simplified outline of this Act.

     * (a) If there are surchargeable contributions for a member for the 1996-97 financial year or a later financial year (being a financial year that ends before 1 July 2005), the Commissioner will calculate the member's adjusted taxable income for the financial year.

     * (b) If the amount calculated is greater than the surcharge threshold amount, the Commissioner will calculate the rate of surcharge and the amount of the surcharge payable on the surchargeable contributions. Only surchargeable contributions calculated for a period after 7.30 pm on 20 August 1996 are subject to surcharge.

     * (c) For a defined benefits superannuation scheme, the surcharge is payable on an amount calculated to be the actuarial value of the benefits that accrued to, and the value of the administration expenses and risk benefits provided in respect of, the member for the financial year.

     * (d) If surcharge is payable for a member for a financial year under an assessment made before 23 March 1999, an advance instalment of one-half of the surcharge is payable on account of surcharge payable for the member for the next financial year. However, no instalment is payable if the contributions for the next financial year are held under an unfunded defined benefits superannuation scheme.

     * (e) If, after the assessment of surcharge, the member's adjusted taxable income is found to be different from the amount that was previously calculated or the surchargeable contributions are found to be different from the amount on which the assessment was based:

        * (i) if the person who was liable to pay the assessed surcharge is still the holder of the contributions--the Commissioner may amend the assessment; or

        * (ii) otherwise--the Commissioner may make a further assessment of surcharge.

     * (f) The holder of a member's surchargeable contributions for a financial year is liable to pay:

        * (i) the surcharge on those contributions; and

        * (ii) if the liability to pay the surcharge arose under an assessment made before 23 March 1999--any advance instalment on the member's surchargeable contributions for the next financial year;

     * within prescribed periods.

     * (g) However, if the holder is a superannuation (unfunded defined benefits) provider, the surcharge is not payable until benefits become payable.

     * (h) If liability for surcharge is increased as a result of an amendment of an assessment or the making of a further assessment, interest is payable on the additional surcharge.

     * (i) Either a superannuation provider or a member may object against an assessment of surcharge in the way set out in Part IVC of the _Taxation Administration Act 1953_ for objecting against assessments of income tax.

     * (j) A late payment penalty applies if surcharge or an advance instalment is not paid on time.

### Part 2--Liability to surcharge and advance instalments

##### 7  Superannuation contributions surcharge

    * _Financial years to which surcharge applies_

    * _	(1)	Superannuation contributions surcharge is payable on a member's surchargeable contributions for the financial year that began on 1 July 1996 or a later financial year that ends before 1 July 2005.

    * _No surcharge is payable unless adjusted taxable income is greater than surcharge threshold_

    * _	(2)	Surcharge is not payable for a financial year unless the member's adjusted taxable income for the financial year is greater than the surcharge threshold for the financial year.

    * _No surcharge is payable by residents of external Territories_

    * _	(3)	Surcharge is not payable for a financial year if the person who would be liable to pay the surcharge is the trustee of a Territory trust, a Territory company or a Territory resident for the purposes of Division 1A of Part III of the Income Tax Assessment Act as it applies to the year of income that comprises that financial year.

      * Note: In certain other circumstances surcharge is not payable (see subsection 10(4)).

    * _No surcharge is payable if surcharge is payable under another Act_

    * _	(4)	Surcharge is not payable on a member's surchargeable contributions if surcharge is payable on those contributions under the _Superannuation Contributions Tax (Constitutionally Protected Superannuation Funds) Assessment and Collection Act 1997_.

##### 7A  Adjusted taxable income--first case

    * (1) This section applies to a member for a financial year if:

     * (a) no payments that were eligible termination payments for the purposes of Subdivision AA of Division 2 of Part III of the Income Tax Assessment Act because of paragraph (a) of the definition of **_eligible termination payment_** in subsection 27A(1) of that Act were made to or for the member in the financial year; or

     * (b) one or more such payments were so made but the total of the reduced amounts of the payments (other than payments that were rolled over before 1 July 1997) was equal to or greater than the amount specified in subsection 5(2) of the _Superannuation Contributions Tax Imposition Act 1997_ as altered under section 7 of that Act for the financial year.

    * (2) The **_reduced amount_** of an eligible termination payment is the amount (if any) remaining after deducting from the amount of the payment the amount of any post-June 1994 invalidity component or CGT exempt component of the payment or any part of the payment that was made from an employee share acquisition scheme.

    * (3) The adjusted taxable income of the member for the financial year is the sum of:

     * (a) the member's taxable income of the year of income comprising the financial year less any amounts included in the member's assessable income of that year of income:

      * (i) that were eligible termination payments for the purposes of Subdivision AA of Division 2 of Part III of the Income Tax Assessment Act (other than amounts that were such payments because of paragraph (a) of the definition of **_eligible termination payment_** in subsection 27A(1) of that Act); or

      * (ii) that were so included under section 26AC or under subsection 26AD(2), (3) or (4) of the Income Tax Assessment Act in respect of a bona fide redundancy amount, an early retirement scheme amount or an invalidity amount as defined in section 159S of that Act; and

     * (b) in respect of the financial year beginning on 1 July 1996 or the following financial year--the amount (if any) by which the amount worked out under paragraph (a) would be increased if it were instead worked out ignoring subsection 271-105(1) in Schedule 2F to the Income Tax Assessment Act; and

     * (c) in respect of the financial year beginning on 1 July 1998 or a later financial year--the amount (if any) by which the amount worked out under paragraph (a) would be increased if it were instead worked out ignoring paragraphs 102UK(2)(b) and 102UM(2)(b) of, and subsection 271-105(1) in Schedule 2F to, the Income Tax Assessment Act; and

     * (d) the member's surchargeable contributions for the financial year, worked out ignoring subsection 8(8) of this Act and subsection 9(9) of the _Superannuation Contributions Tax (Members of Constitutionally Protected Superannuation Funds) Assessment and Collection Act 1997_; and

     * (e) in respect of a financial year beginning on or after 1 July 1999--if the member is an employee (within the meaning of the _Fringe Benefits Tax Assessment Act 1986_) who has a reportable fringe benefits total (as defined in that Act) for the year of income comprising the financial year--the reportable fringe benefits total for the year of income.

##### 7B  Adjusted taxable income--second case

    * (1) This section applies to a member for a financial year if:

     * (a) one or more payments that were eligible termination payments for the purposes of Subdivision AA of Division 2 of Part III of the Income Tax Assessment Act because of paragraph (a) of the definition of **_eligible termination payment_** in subsection 27A(1) of that Act were made to or for the member in the financial year; and

     * (b) the total of the reduced amounts of the payments (other than payments that were rolled over before 1 July 1997) was less than the amount specified in subsection 5(2) of the _Superannuation Contributions Tax Imposition Act 1997_ as altered under section 7 of that Act for the financial year.

    * (2) The **_reduced amount_** of an eligible termination payment is the amount (if any) remaining after deducting from the amount of the payment the amount of any post-June 1994 invalidity component or CGT exempt component of the payment or any part of the payment that was made from an employee share acquisition scheme.

    * (3) The adjusted taxable income of the member for the financial year is the sum of:

     * (a) the member's taxable income of the year of income comprising the financial year less any of the following amounts included in the member's assessable income of that year of income:

      * (i) amounts that were eligible termination payments for the purposes of Subdivision AA of Division 2 of Part III of the Income Tax Assessment Act;

      * (ii) amounts that were so included under section 26AC or under subsection 26AD(2), (3) or (4) of the Income Tax Assessment Act in respect of a bona fide redundancy amount, an early retirement scheme amount or an invalidity amount as defined in section 159S of that Act; and

     * (b) in respect of the financial year beginning on 1 July 1996 or the following financial year--the amount (if any) by which the amount worked out under paragraph (a) would be increased if it were instead worked out ignoring subsection 271-105(1) in Schedule 2F to the Income Tax Assessment Act; and

     * (c) in respect of the financial year beginning on 1 July 1998 or a later financial year--the amount (if any) by which the amount worked out under paragraph (a) would be increased if it were instead worked out ignoring paragraphs 102UK(2)(b) and 102UM(2)(b) of, and subsection 271-105(1) in Schedule 2F to, the Income Tax Assessment Act; and

     * (d) in respect of each eligible termination payment referred to in subsection (1)--whichever of the following amounts is appropriate:

      * (i) if the post-20 August 1996 period is less than 365 days--the amount (excluding any cents, cent or fraction of a cent included in that amount) worked out using the formula:

       * (i) so much of the part (if any) of the payment that was not rolled-over as is included in the member's taxable income of the year of income comprising the financial year; and

     * (b) if the Commissioner approves in writing another method as being appropriate in relation to the member for the financial year, being a method that excludes Government co-contributions made under the _Superannuation (Government Co-contribution for Low Income Earners) Act 2003 _and contributions made by the member for which the member is not entitled to an income tax deduction under the Income Tax Assessment Act or under the _Income Tax Assessment Act 1997_--the method so approved.

    * _Regulations_

    * _	(6)	Regulations made for the purposes of paragraph (5)(a) may specify, or make provision for the Commissioner to specify in writing, different methods in relation to different superannuation schemes, different classes of superannuation schemes or different classes of members of a superannuation scheme.

    * _	(8)	The amount of the **_surchargeable contributions_** of a member for a financial year is the amount worked out under subsection (2) or (3) (as appropriate), reduced by the amount worked out under subsection (9), if:

     * (a) an eligible termination payment is made to the member in the financial year from the superannuation fund, approved deposit fund or RSA; and

    * _Amount of the reduction_

      * Step 1._	Work out the amount that would have been the taxed element of the retained amount of the post-June 83 component of the eligible termination payment if the amount of the excessive component of the eligible termination payment had been nil.

      * _Step 2._	Work out the taxed element of the retained amount of the post-June 83 component of the eligible termination payment.

      * _Step 3._	Subtract the result of step 2 from the result of step 1.

      * _Step 4._	Divide the result of step 3 by 0.85.

      * _Step 5._	Subtract the result of step 3 from the result of step 4.

      * _Step 8._	Identify the lesser of the results of steps 6 and 7 (or either result if they are the same).

##### 8A  Holder of surchargeable contributions of a member

    * _Application_

    * _	(1)	This section explains who is to be regarded as the holder of the surchargeable contributions of a member for a particular financial year in respect of which surcharge is payable on those contributions.

    * _Where there are contributed amounts and no payment of benefit has been made_

    * _	(1A)	This section is subject to section 10A.

    * (2) Subject to subsection (3), if:

     * (a) there were any contributed amounts in respect of a member for a financial year; and

     * (b) a lump sum has not been paid, and a pension or annuity has not begun to be paid, to or in respect of the member by the relevant superannuation provider;

    * a reference in this Act to the **_holder _**of the surchargeable contributions of the member for the financial year is a reference to:

     * (c) if only one superannuation provider holds the contributed amounts referred to in paragraph (a) at the time when an assessment is made of the surcharge payable on the surchargeable contributions of the member for the financial year--that superannuation provider; or

     * (d) otherwise--each superannuation provider who holds any of those contributed amounts at that time, to the extent to which the surchargeable contributions of the member for the financial year are included in the contributed amounts held by that provider.

    * _What happens if member dies_

    * _	(3)	If:

     * (a) a superannuation provider would, apart from this subsection, be taken under subsection (2) to be the holder of surchargeable contributions of a member for the financial year; and

     * (b) the member died in the financial year;

    * subsection (2) does not apply in relation to the member in respect of the financial year and later financial years.

    * _Where there are contributed amounts and a payment of benefit has been made_

    * _	(4)	If there were any contributed amounts in respect of a member for a financial year:

     * (a) that have been paid to a person other than a superannuation provider; or

     * (b) in respect of which a pension or annuity has begun to be paid;

    * a reference in this Act to the **_holder _**of the surchargeable contributions of the member for the financial year is a reference to the person to whom the amounts were paid or the pension or annuity has begun to be paid, as the case may be.

##### 9  Surcharge threshold

    * _Surcharge threshold for 1996-97 financial year_

    * _	(1)	The **_surcharge threshold_** for the 1996-97 financial year is $70,000.

    * _Surcharge threshold for later financial year_

    * _	(2)	The **_surcharge threshold_** for a later financial year is the amount calculated using the formula:

    * where: 

    * **_previous surcharge threshold _**means the surcharge threshold for the financial year immediately before the financial year for which the surcharge threshold is being calculated.

    * **_indexation factor _**means the number calculated under subsections (4) and (5) for the financial year for which the surcharge threshold is being calculated.

    * _Rounding off of amount of surcharge threshold_

    * _	(3)	If an amount worked out for the purposes of subsection (2) is an amount of dollars and cents:

**Table A**


Application, saving or transitional provisions**

   * **_Taxation Laws Amendment (Trust Loss and Other Deductions) Act 1998 
   * _(No. 17, 1998)


##### Schedule 1

##### 34  Application

   * The amendment made by this Part applies to the calculation of adjusted taxable income for the financial year that began on 1 July 1996 or a later financial year.

   * _A New Tax System (Closely Held Trusts) Act 1999_ (No. 70, 1999)

##### Schedule 2  

##### 16  Application

   * The amendment made by this Part applies to the calculation of adjusted taxable income for the financial year that began on 1 July 1998 or a later financial year.

   * _Superannuation Contributions and Termination Payments Taxes Legislation Amendment Act 1999_ (No. 131, 1999)

##### Schedule 1

##### 43  Transitional--superannuation providers to give corrective statements

   * (1) If a superannuation provider has, before the commencement of this item, given a statement to the Commissioner under section 13 of the _Superannuation Contributions Tax (Assessment and Collection) Act 1997_ that did not comply with the requirements that would have applied if the amendments made by items of this Schedule that are taken to have commenced on 5 June 1997 had been in force, the provider must give to the Commissioner not later than a date fixed by the Minister by notice published in the _Gazette_, in substitution for the first-mentioned statement, a further statement that complies with those requirements.

   * (2) A superannuation provider who contravenes subsection (1) is guilty of an offence punishable on conviction by a fine of not more than 60 penalty units.

      * Note 1: Chapter 2 of the _Criminal Code_ sets out the general principles of criminal responsibility.

      * Note 2: The amount of a penalty unit is stated in section 4AA of the _Crimes Act 1914_. If a body corporate is convicted of an offence, subsection 4B(3) of that Act allows a court to impose a fine that is not greater than 5 times the maximum fine that could be imposed by the court on an individual convicted of the same offence.

   * (3) Chapter 2 of the _Criminal Code_ applies to offences against subsection (2).

##### 44  Transitional--retrospective objections

   * If a notice of assessment was given to a member or a superannuation provider before the day on which this Act received the Royal Assent: 

     * (a) if the member or provider did not object against the assessment before that day, then, for the purpose of calculating under section 14ZW of the _Taxation Administration Act 1953_ the period within which the member or provider may object against the assessment, the notice is taken to have been served on that day; and

     * (b) if the member or provider objected against the assessment before the day on which this Act received the Royal Assent, the member or provider may make a further objection against the assessment and, for the purpose of calculating under section 14ZW of the _Taxation Administration Act 1953_ the period within which the member or provider may make the further objection against the assessment, the notice is taken to have been served on that day.

##### 45  Transitional--amendments of assessments

   * Nothing in section 17A of the _Superannuation Contributions Tax (Assessment and Collection) Act 1997_ prevents the amendment of an assessment for the purpose of giving effect:

     * (a) to any amendment made by this Schedule or to item 43 or 44; or

     * (b) to anything done under a provision of that Act as amended by this Schedule or under item 43 or 44.

   * _Tax Laws Amendment (Repeal of Inoperative Provisions) Act 2006 
   * _(No. 101, 2006)


##### Schedule 6

##### 1  Application of Schedule 1 and 2 amendments

   * Except as mentioned in items 2 and 3, the repeals and amendments made by Schedules 1 and 2 apply:

     * (a) so far as they affect assessments--to assessments for the 2006-07 income year and all later income years; and

     * (b) otherwise--to acts done or omitted to be done, or states of affairs existing, after the commencement of the repeals and amendments.

##### 6  Object

   * The object of this Part is to ensure that, despite the repeals and amendments made by this Act, the full legal and administrative consequences of:

     * (a) any act done or omitted to be done; or

     * (b) any state of affairs existing; or

     * (c) any period ending;

   * before such a repeal or amendment applies, can continue to arise and be carried out, directly or indirectly through an indefinite number of steps, even if some or all of those steps are taken after the repeal or amendment applies.

##### 7  Making and amending assessments, and doing other things, in relation to past matters

   * Even though an Act is repealed or amended by this Act, the repeal or amendment is disregarded for the purpose of doing any of the following under any Act or legislative instrument (within the meaning of the _Legislative Instruments Act 2003_):

     * (a) making or amending an assessment (including under a provision that is itself repealed or amended);

     * (b) exercising any right or power, performing any obligation or duty or doing any other thing (including under a provision that is itself repealed or amended);

   * in relation to any act done or omitted to be done, any state of affairs existing, or any period ending, before the repeal or amendment applies.

      * Example 1: On 31 July 1999, Greg Ltd lodged its annual return under former section 160ARE of the _Income Tax Assessment Act 1936_. The return stated that the company had a credit on its franking account and that no franking deficit tax was payable for the 1998-99 franking year. Under former section 160ARH of that Act, the Commissioner was taken to have made an assessment consistent with the return.

      * Following an audit undertaken after the repeal of Part IIIAA of that Act, the Commissioner concludes that Greg Ltd fraudulently overfranked dividends it paid during the 1998-99 franking year, and had a franking account deficit for that franking year. As a result, the Commissioner considers that franking deficit tax and a penalty by way of additional tax are payable.

      * The Commissioner can amend the assessment under former section 160ARN of that Act, because item 7 of this Schedule disregards the repeal of that section for the purposes of making an assessment in relation to the 1998-99 franking year. Item 7 will also disregard the repeal of Division 11 of former Part IIIAA to the extent necessary for the Commissioner to assess Greg Ltd's liability to a penalty by way of additional tax.

      * Despite the repeal of sections 160ARU and 160ARV, item 9 will ensure that the general interest charge will accrue on the unpaid franking deficit tax and penalty until they are paid.

      * Item 7 will also preserve Greg Ltd's right, under former section 160ART of that Act, to object against the Commissioner's amended assessment (including the penalty), since the objection is the exercise of a right in relation to a franking year that ended before the repeal of Part IIIAA.

      * Example 2: During the 1997-98 income year, Duffy Property Ltd withheld amounts from its employees' wages as required by former Divisions 1AAA and 2 of Part VI of the _Income Tax Assessment Act 1936_. The company failed to notify the Commissioner of those amounts, and failed to remit them to the Commissioner.

      * Following an audit undertaken after the repeal of those Divisions, the Commissioner discovers that the withheld amounts have not been remitted. The company's records are incomplete and the Commissioner is unable to completely ascertain the extent of its liability for the withheld amounts. Under section 222AGA of that Act, the Commissioner makes an estimate of the liability.

      * Item 7 will disregard the repeal of section 220AAZA of that Act (which empowered the Commissioner to recover the amount of the estimate). Even though the estimate is made after the repeal, it relates to amounts withheld before the repeal.

##### 8  Saving of provisions about effect of assessments

   * If a provision or part of a provision that is repealed or amended by this Act deals with the effect of an assessment, the repeal or amendment is disregarded in relation to assessments made, before or after the repeal or amendment applies, in relation to any act done or omitted to be done, any state of affairs existing, or any period ending, before the repeal or amendment applies.

##### 9  Saving of provisions about general interest charge, failure to notify penalty or late reconciliation statement penalty

   * If: 

     * (a) a provision or part of a provision that is repealed or amended by this Act provides for the payment of:

      * (i) general interest charge, failure to notify penalty or late reconciliation statement penalty (all within the meaning of the _Income Tax Assessment Act 1936_); or

      * (ii) interest under the _Taxation (Interest on Overpayments and Early Payments) Act 1983_; and

     * (b) in a particular case, the period in respect of which the charge, penalty or interest is payable (whether under the provision or under the _Taxation Administration Act 1953_) has not begun, or has begun but not ended, when the provision is repealed or amended;

   * then, despite the repeal or amendment, the provision or part continues to apply in the particular case until the end of the period.

##### 10  Repeals disregarded for the purposes of dependent provisions

   * If the operation of a provision (the **_subject provision_**) of any Act or legislative instrument (within the meaning of the _Legislative Instruments Act 2003_) made under any Act depends to any extent on an Act, or a provision of an Act, that is repealed by this Act, the repeal is disregarded so far as it affects the operation of the subject provision.

##### 11  Schedule does not limit operation of section 8 of the Acts Interpretation Act 1901

   * This Schedule does not limit the operation of section 8 of the _Acts Interpretation Act 1901_.

   * _Superannuation Legislation Amendment (Simplification) Act 2007
   * _(No. 15, 2007)


##### Schedule 1

##### 406  Application

   * (1) The amendments made by this Schedule apply to the 2007-2008 income year and later years.

   * (2) Despite subitem (1), those amendments apply to the 2007-2008 financial year and later years, to the extent that they relate to Division 292 of the _Income Tax Assessment Act 1997_.

   * (3) Despite subitem (1), those amendments apply on and after 1 July 2007, to the extent that they relate to any of the following:

     * (a) Divisions 82 and 83 of the _Income Tax Assessment Act 1997_;

     * (b) Divisions 301 to 307 of that Act.
