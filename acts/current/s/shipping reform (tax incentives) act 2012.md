    * (b) the requirements in section 10 are met for the vessel for one or more days during the certificate year; and

    * (c) during the income year the vessel was used, or was available for use, wholly or mainly for business or commercial activities involving carrying shipping cargo, or shipping passengers, on voyages.

     * Note 1: A certificate is needed for an entity to be eligible for a shipping tax incentive for the certificate year.

     * Note 2: A decision under this subsection is reviewable (see section 24).

   * (2) The certificate may set out:

    * (b) that the entity has a training plan that meets the training requirements; and

    * (c) the days (if any) during the next income year for which all of the requirements referred to in subsection (3) are likely to be met.

   * The certificate may set out other matters.

     * Note 1: The certificate will need to set out the matters in paragraphs (a) and (b) for the entity to be eligible for the exempt income incentive (see section 51-100 of the _Income Tax Assessment Act 1997_).

     * Note 2: For paragraph (c), the applicant may have been required to give information about the next income year (see paragraph 11(2)(b)).

     * Note 3: A decision about the matters set out in the certificate is reviewable (see section 24).

   * (3) The certificate must set out the days during the certificate year for which all of the following requirements are met:

    * (a) the requirements in paragraphs (1)(a), (b) and (c);

    * (b) the management requirements and training requirements, if the certificate sets out the matters in paragraphs (2)(a) and (b).

     * Note: A decision about the matters set out in the certificate is reviewable (see section 24).

   * (4) However, the days set out under subsection (3) must not include:

    * (a) a day during the first 9 months of the certificate year if:

     * (i) a certificate under this section has never been issued to the entity for the vessel for an earlier income year; and

     * (ii) the entity does not have a notice under section 14 for the vessel for the certificate year; or

    * (b) a day that is earlier than 1 July 2012.

   * (5) For the purposes of this Act and the _Income Tax Assessment Act 1997_, the days set out under subsection (3) are the days to which the certificate applies.

     * Note: These days may be varied (see section 13).

   * (6) Despite subsection (1), the Minister is not required to issue a certificate under this section if a request under section 12 for information about the application for the certificate has not been complied with.

##### 9  Shipping exempt income certificates not to be issued in certain circumstances

   * _10 year lockout period applies in certain circumstances_

   * _	(1)	Despite section 8, the Minister must not issue a shipping exempt income certificate under that section to an entity for a vessel for the certificate year if:

    * (a) the entity does not have a shipping exempt income certificate for the vessel for the previous income year; and

    * (b) a shipping exempt income certificate has been issued to the entity for the vessel for that previous income year or an earlier income year; and

    * (c) there are less than 10 income years, or less than the number of income years determined under subsection (3) for the entity, between:

     * (i) the last income year for which a shipping exempt income certificate has been issued to the entity for the vessel; and

     * (ii) the certificate year.

   * (2) A **_shipping exempt income certificate_** is a certificate issued under section 8 that sets out the matters in paragraphs 8(2)(a) and (b).

   * _Reducing the 10 year lockout period_

   * _	(3)	The Minister may, on application, determine a number less than 10 to be the number of income years that applies to the applicant under paragraph (1)(c).

    * (a) in the approved form; and

   * (5) A determination under subsection (3) is not a legislative instrument.

   * _Extension to associates_

   * _	(6)	Paragraphs (1)(a), (b) and (c) apply in relation to an applicant for a certificate as if each entity that is, or has at any time been, an associate of the applicant were at all times a part of the applicant rather than a separate entity.

   * _Certificate can still be issued for other tax incentives_

   * Despite subsection (4), a vessel of a kind specified under paragraph (b) is not an **_excluded vessel_**.

##### 11  Applying for a certificate

   * (1) An application for a certificate under section 8 must be:

    * (a) in the approved form; and

    * (b) accompanied by the fee (if any) specified in regulations made for the purposes of this paragraph; and

    * (c) made after the end of the income year, but at least 30 days before the entity is required to lodge its income tax return for the income year.

     * Note: Section 26 deals with approved forms.

   * (2) As well as requiring information relevant to the income year, the approved form may require:

    * (a) information about any tax incentives the entity utilised for the previous income year in reliance on a certificate issued under section 8 for the previous income year; and

    * (b) information about the following for the next income year:

     * (ii) the applicant's arrangements in relation to the vessel.

     * Note: A certificate may give notice of the likelihood of a further certificate being issued for the next income year (see paragraph 8(2)(c)).

##### 12  Minister may request further information

   * (1) The Minister may request the applicant in writing to give specified information, or specified kinds of information, to the Minister about the application.

   * (2) The request may be for the information or kinds of information to be given within 10 business days after the request was made.

     * Note: Failing to comply with the request may result in the Minister refusing to issue the certificate.

   * (3) The request may be for the information or kinds of information to be given in the approved form.

     * Note: Section 26 deals with approved forms.

   * (4) Subsections (2) and (3) do not limit subsection (1).

##### 13  Non-compliance relating to certificates

   * (1) This section applies in relation to a certificate issued under section 8 to an entity for an income year if:

    * (a) based on information currently before the Minister, the Minister is satisfied that the certificate should not have been issued; or

    * (b) the entity fails to comply, to the extent that it is capable of doing so, with a notice given to it under subsection 19(1) (about providing information) in relation to the certificate.

   * (2) The Minister may:

    * (a) give the entity one or more written requests to take specified remedial action within specified periods; and

    * (b) if satisfied that the entity has failed to comply with a request given under paragraph (a), vary or revoke the certificate by written notice given to the entity.

     * Note 1: A decision under paragraph (b) is reviewable (see section 24).

     * Note 2: An example of a variation is varying the days to which the certificate applies. Another is varying the certificate so that it no longer sets out the matters in paragraphs 8(2)(a) and (b), and so ceases to be a shipping exempt income certificate.

     * Note 3: Revoking the certificate means the entity ceases to have it. If a certificate is revoked, or ceases to be a shipping exempt income certificate, the entity will not be eligible for the exempt income incentive for up to another 10 income years (see section 9).

     * Note 4: Consequences of a revocation will cease to apply if the revocation is set aside on review.

   * (3) If the Minister is satisfied that the circumstances require immediate action, the Minister may, by written notice given to the entity, vary or revoke the certificate without acting under subsection (2).

     * Note: A decision under this subsection is reviewable (see section 24).

     * Note 1: A notice is only relevant for the first income year that the entity seeks shipping tax incentives for the vessel. Getting the notice maximises the incentives for that year (see subsection 8(4)).

     * Note 2: A decision under this subsection is reviewable (see section 24).

   * (2) The notice may set out:

    * (a) that the entity's management arrangements meet the management requirements; and

    * (a) based on information currently before the Minister, the Minister is satisfied that the eligibility notice should not have been given; or

    * (b) the entity fails to comply, to the extent that it is capable of doing so, with a notice given to it under subsection 19(1) (about providing information) in relation to the eligibility notice.

   * (2) The Minister may:

    * (a) give the entity one or more written requests to take specified remedial action within specified periods; and

    * (b) by written notice given to the entity, vary or revoke the eligibility notice if the Minister is satisfied that the entity has failed to comply with a request given under paragraph (a).
