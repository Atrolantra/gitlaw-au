### 
### An Act to impose a superannuation contributions tax and to declare the rate of the tax


    * 1**  Short title **[_see _Note 1]

    * This Act may be cited as the _Superannuation Contributions Tax Imposition Act 1997_.

    * 2**  Commencement **[_see _Note 1]

    * This Act commences on the day on which it receives the Royal Assent.

##### 3  Interpretation

    * Expressions used in this Act that are defined by the _Superannuation Contributions Tax (Assessment and Collection) Act 1997_ have the same meanings as in that Act.

##### 4  Imposition of superannuation contributions surcharge

    * The superannuation contributions surcharge that is payable on a member's surchargeable contributions for a financial year under the _Superannuation Contributions Tax (Assessment and Collection) Act 1997_ is imposed by this Act.

      * Note: Surcharge is not payable for the financial year that began on 1 July 2005 or a later financial year--see subsection 7(1) of the _Superannuation Contributions Tax (Assessment and Collection) Act 1997_.

##### 5  Rate of superannuation contributions surcharge

    * (1AA) In this section:

    * **_higher income amount_** means:

     * (a) for the 2003-2004 financial year--$114,981; and

     * (b) for the 2004-2005 financial year--that amount as indexed under section 7.

    * **_lower income amount_** means:

     * (a) for the 2003-2004 financial year--$94,691; and

     * (b) for the 2004-2005 financial year--that amount as indexed under section 7.

    * **_maximum surcharge percentage_** means:

     * (a) for the 2003-2004 financial year--14.5%; and

     * (b) for the 2004-2005 financial year--12.5%.

    * (1) Unless subsection (3) applies, if the member's adjusted taxable income for a financial year (**_relevant adjusted taxable income_**) is not less than the lower income amount but is less than the higher income amount, the rate of the superannuation contributions surcharge that applies to the member for that year is the percentage (calculated to 5 decimal places) of the member's surchargeable contributions for that year worked out using the formula:



    * where: 

    * **_A_** is:



    * (1A) If the percentage calculated under subsection (1) for a financial year would, if it were worked out to 6 decimal places, end with a number greater than 4, the number so calculated is increased by 0.00001.

    * (2) If the member's adjusted taxable income for a financial year is equal to, or greater than, the higher income amount, the rate of the superannuation contributions surcharge that applies to the member for that year is the maximum surcharge percentage of the member's surchargeable contributions for that year.

    * (3) If:

     * (a) the member has not quoted his or her tax file number in connection with the operation or the possible future operation of the _Superannuation Contributions Tax (Collection and Assessment) Act 1997 _to the superannuation provider, or one of the superannuation providers, who, at the end of a financial year, held any of the member's surchargeable contributions for that year; and

     * (b) the Commissioner has not, after taking all reasonable steps, found out the member's tax file number; and

     * (c) the Commissioner has written a letter to the member at the member's last-known address telling the member that, if the member does not quote his or her tax file number, the rate of surcharge that will apply to the member for a financial year (the **_relevant financial year_**) may be the maximum surcharge percentage of the member's surchargeable contributions for the relevant financial year;

    * the following provisions have effect: 

     * (d) if contributed amounts in respect of contributions began to be paid for or by the member to a superannuation provider before 7 May 1997 and the member's surchargeable contributions for the relevant financial year exceed the surchargeable contributions threshold--the rate of surcharge that applies in respect of the member's surchargeable contributions for the relevant financial year is the maximum surcharge percentage of those contributions;

     * (e) if contributed amounts in respect of contributions began to be paid for or by the member to a superannuation provider before 7 May 1997 and the member's surchargeable contributions for the relevant financial year do not exceed the surchargeable contributions threshold--the rate of surcharge that applies in respect of the member's surchargeable contributions for the relevant financial year is nil;

     * (f) subject to subsection (4), if no contributed amounts in respect of contributions began to be paid for or by the member to a superannuation provider before 7 May 1997--the rate of surcharge that applies in respect of the member's surchargeable contributions for the relevant financial year is the maximum surcharge percentage of those contributions.

    * (4) If:

     * (a) the Commissioner has written a letter to a member as mentioned in paragraph (3)(c); and

     * (b) the member has not quoted his or her tax file number as mentioned in paragraph (3)(a) within 3 months after the letter was sent;

    * paragraph (3)(f) does not apply in respect of the member unless the Commissioner has, after that period, written a further letter to the member:

     * (c) to an address determined by the Commissioner as most appropriate for the letter to reach the member; and

     * (d) in the same terms as the earlier letter.

##### 6  Surchargeable contributions threshold

    * _Surchargeable contributions threshold for the 1996-97 financial year_

    * _	(1)	The **_surchargeable contributions threshold_** for the 1996-97 financial year is $2,000.

    * _Surchargeable contributions for a later financial year  _

    * _	(2)	The **_surchargeable contributions threshold_** for a financial year (the **_relevant financial year_**) after the 1996-97 financial year is the amount worked out using the formula:



    * where: 

    * **_previous threshold_** means the surchargeable contributions threshold for the financial year immediately before the relevant financial year.

    * **_indexation factor_** means the number worked out under subsections 9(4) and (5) of the _Superannuation Contributions Tax (Assessment and Collection) Act 1997_ for the relevant financial year.

    * **_current charge percentage _**means the number that is specified in subsection 19(2) of the _Superannuation Guarantee (Administration) Act 1992 _for the quarter beginning on 1 July of the relevant financial year.

    * **_previous charge percentage _**means the number that is specified in subsection 19(2) of the _Superannuation Guarantee (Administration) Act 1992_ for the quarter beginning on 1 July of the financial year immediately before the relevant financial year.

##### 7  Indexation

    * _Indexation of certain amounts for 2004-05 financial year_

    * _	(1)	Section 5 applies in relation to an indexing financial year as if each indexable amount were replaced by the amount worked out using the formula:



    * where: 

    * **_previous indexable amount_** means the indexable amount for the financial year immediately before the indexing financial year.

    * **_relevant indexation factor_** means the indexation factor for the indexing financial year.

    * _Rounding off of indexed amounts_

    * _	(2)	If an amount worked out under subsection (1) is an amount of dollars and cents:

     * (a) if the number of cents is less than 50--the amount is to be rounded down to the nearest whole dollar; or

     * (b) otherwise--the amount is to be rounded up to the nearest whole dollar.

    * _Indexation factor_

    * _	(3)	The **_indexation factor_** for an indexing financial year is the number calculated, to 3 decimal places, using the formula:



    * where: 

    * **_current March year_** means the period of 12 months ending on 31 March immediately before the indexing financial year.

    * **_previous March year_** means the period of 12 months immediately before the current March year.

    * _Rounding up of indexation factor_

    * _	(4)	If the number calculated under subsection (3) for a financial year would, if it were worked out to 4 decimal places, end with a number greater than 4, the number so calculated is increased by 0.001.

    * _Change in index numbers_

    * _	(5)	If, at any time, whether before or after the commencement of this Act, the Australian Statistician has published or publishes an index number for a quarter in substitution for an index number previously published for the quarter, the publication of the later index number is to be disregarded.

    * _Indexable amounts to be published_

    * _	(6)	The Commissioner must publish before, or as soon as practicable after, the start of the 2004-05 financial year the indexable amounts as replaced under subsection (1) for that year.

    * _Definitions_

    * _	(7)	In this section:

    * **_indexable amount_** means:

     * (a) an amount stated in section 5; or

     * (b) if that amount has previously been altered under this section--the altered amount.

    * **_indexing financial year_** means the 2004-05 financial year.

    * **_index number_**, for a quarter, means the estimate of full-time adult average weekly ordinary time earnings for the middle month of the quarter published by the Australian Statistician.

      * Note: For the purposes of this section, **_Australian Statistician_** means the Australian Statistician referred to in subsection 5(2) of the _Australian Bureau of Statistics Act 1975_.

##### 8  Severability

    * If, apart from this section, section 4 would impose in relation to a State, or an authority or officer of a State, a superannuation contributions surcharge the imposition of which in relation to the State, authority or officer would exceed the legislative power of the Commonwealth, section 4 has effect as if it did not impose that surcharge in relation to the State, authority or officer, as the case may be.

##### 9  Act does not impose tax on property of State

    * (1) Without limiting section 7, this Act does not impose a tax on property of any kind belonging to a State.

    * (2) In this section:

    * **_property of any kind belonging to a State_** has the same meaning as in section 114 of the Constitution.
