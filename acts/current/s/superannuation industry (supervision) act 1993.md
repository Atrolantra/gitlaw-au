### Part 2A--Licensing of trustees and groups of individual trustees

#### Division 1--Object of this Part

##### 29A  Object of this Part and the relationship of this Part to other provisions

    * (1) The object of this Part is to set out provisions relating to the granting of RSE licences to:

     * (a) constitutional corporations; and

     * (b) other bodies corporate; and

     * (c) groups of individual trustees.

    * (2) The following is a simplified outline showing some key relationships between this Part and other provisions of the Act and the regulations that trustees should be aware of:

    * Certain provisions may be contravened if unlicensed trustees carry out particular activities (e.g.: sections 29J and 152). The trustee, or group of individual trustees, of a fund or trust may obtain an RSE licence under this Part.

            * Note 1: If the trustee is a constitutional corporation, the trustee obtaining an RSE licence may result in a fund or trust becoming an approved deposit fund or pooled superannuation trust, which are each registrable superannuation entities.

            * Note 2: If the trustee or group of individual trustees makes an election under section 19, the fund may become a regulated superannuation fund. Regulated superannuation funds other than self managed superannuation funds are registrable superannuation entities.

    * A trustee, or group of individual trustees, that has obtained an RSE licence may have a registrable superannuation entity registered under Part 2B. Certain provisions may be contravened if certain activities are carried out while a registrable superannuation entity is not registered (e.g.: accepting contributions while the entity is unregistered may lead to an offence under section 34.)

            * Note: A failure to register the fund or trust may also lead to a breach of an RSE licence condition and possible loss of the RSE licence.

#### Division 2--Classes of RSE licences

##### 29B  Classes of RSE licences

    * (1) There are to be classes of RSE licences.

    * (2) One class of RSE licences is to be a class that enables a trustee that holds a licence of that class to be a trustee of:

     * (a) any public offer entity; and

     * (b) any other registrable superannuation entity included in a class of registrable superannuation entities specified in regulations made for the purposes of this subsection;

    * subject to any condition imposed on that licence under subsection 29EA(3).

        * Note 1: An RSE licence of this class is called a **_public offer entity licence_**: see subsection 10(1).

        * Note 2: Only constitutional corporations may hold public offer entity licences: see paragraph 29D(1)(g).

    * (3) Another class of RSE licences is to be a class that enables a trustee that:

     * (a) holds a licence of that class; or

     * (b) is a member of a group of individual trustees that holds a licence of that class;

    * to be a trustee of any registrable superannuation entity included in a class of registrable superannuation entities (other than a class of public offer entities) specified in regulations made for the purposes of this subsection, subject to any condition imposed on that licence under subsection 29EA(3).

    * (4) The regulations may provide for other classes of RSE licences. For each such class, the regulations must specify the classes of registrable superannuation entities of which a trustee that:

     * (a) holds a licence of that class; or

     * (b) is a member of a group of individual trustees that holds a licence of that class;

    * is enabled to be a trustee, subject to any condition imposed on that licence under subsection 29EA(3).

    * (5) The classes of registrable superannuation entity that the regulations may specify in relation to a particular class of RSE licence may include one or more classes of registrable superannuation entity that the regulations specify in relation to another class of RSE licence.

### Part 2C--MySuper

#### Division 1--Object of this Part

##### 29R  Object of this Part

    * (1) It is intended that all MySuper products will be simple products sharing common characteristics.

    * (2) The object of this Part is to ensure that a class of beneficial interest in a regulated superannuation fund is not offered as a MySuper product unless it has those characteristics.

    * (3) This is done by requiring the RSE licensee of a regulated superannuation fund to obtain authority from APRA before offering a class of beneficial interest in the fund as a MySuper product.

    * (4) The ability of an RSE licensee to offer a MySuper product is significant for the purposes of the _Superannuation Guarantee (Administration) Act 1992_. Under that Act, employers will need to pay contributions for an employee who has no chosen fund into a fund that offers a MySuper product, in order to meet the choice of fund requirements and so avoid an increased individual superannuation guarantee shortfall for the employee.

#### Division 2--Applying for authority

##### 29S  Application for authority to offer a MySuper product

    * Who may apply?

    * (1) An RSE licensee may apply to APRA for authority to offer a class of beneficial interest in a regulated superannuation fund as a MySuper product.

    * Requirements for applications

    * (2) An application for authority to offer a class of beneficial interest in a regulated superannuation fund as a MySuper product must:

     * (a) be in the approved form; and

     * (b) contain the information required by the approved form; and

     * (c) state the RSE licensee's and the fund's ABNs; and

     * (d) be accompanied by an uptodate copy of the trust deed by which the fund is constituted (except to the extent that the trust deed is constituted by governing rules of the fund); and

     * (e) be accompanied by an uptodate copy of the governing rules of the fund (except to the extent that the governing rules are constituted by the law of the Commonwealth or by unwritten rules); and

     * (f) be accompanied by elections made in accordance with each of the following sections:

      * (i) section 29SAA;

      * (ii) section 29SAB;

      * (iii) section 29SAC.

    * Notifying certain changes while applications are pending

    * (3) If:

    * Notice about complying fund status

     * (a) whether the entity is or is not a complying superannuation fund; or

     * (b) whether the entity is or is not a complying approved deposit fund; or

     * (c) whether the entity is or is not a pooled superannuation trust;

    * as the case may be, in relation to a year of income specified in the notice.

    * Reasons 

    * (2) If the Regulator gives a notice to a trustee of an entity stating that:

     * (a) the entity is not a complying superannuation fund; or

     * (b) the entity is not a complying approved deposit fund; or

     * (c) the entity is not a pooled superannuation trust;

    * as the case may be, in relation to a year of income, the notice must set out the reasons why the Regulator so stated.

    * Commissioner of Taxation to be told about notice 

    * (3) When the APRA gives a notice under this section, APRA must give particulars of the notice to the Commissioner of Taxation.

        * Note: A statement of the tax file number of the entity may accompany the particulars of the notice. See subsection 299U(3).

    * Revocation 

    * (4) If:

     * (a) the Regulator gives a notice under this section (the **_original notice_**) to a trustee of an entity stating that:

      * (i) the entity is a complying superannuation fund; or

      * (ii) the entity is a complying approved deposit fund; or

      * (iii) the entity is a pooled superannuation trust;

     * as the case may be, in relation to a year of income; and

      * (i) the entity is not a complying superannuation fund; or

      * (ii) the entity is not a complying approved deposit fund; or

     * as the case may be, in relation to the year of income;

    * the second notice is taken to revoke the original notice.

        * Note: Because "the Regulator" is whichever of APRA or the Commissioner of Taxation is administering this provision in respect of a fund, a notice could initially be given to a fund by APRA under paragraph 40(4)(a), and later the Commissioner of Taxation could give a notice to the same fund under paragraph 40(4)(b). This is because the fund could have become a self managed superannuation fund after the first notice was given.

      * (i) the period of 12 months beginning on the day on which this section commenced; or 

      * (ii) such later period as is prescribed by the regulations;

     * that section 71E is to apply to all posttest time investments of the fund in that entity;

          * Note: Under subsection 103(2A), the trustee, or the trustees, of the fund must keep the election, or a copy of it, for 10 years after it is made.

    * then subsection (2) or (3), as the case requires, applies, and is taken always to have applied, to the posttest time investment.

    * Sum of purchase prices of posttest time investments does not exceed the principal--investment not an inhouse asset

    * (2) The posttest time investment is not an inhouse asset of the fund at the posttest time if the sum of the following amounts does not exceed the amount of the principal:

     * (a) the purchase price of the posttest time investment;

     * (b) the purchase price of any previous posttest time investment in the first entity by the fund.

    * Sum of purchase prices of posttest time investments exceeds the principal--formula to be applied

    * (3) If the sum of the following:

     * (a) the purchase price of the posttest time investment;

     * (b) the purchase price of any previous posttest time investment in the first entity by the fund;

    * exceeds the amount of the principal, then:

     * (c) the posttest time investment is an inhouse asset of the fund at the posttest time; and

     * (d) if the posttest time investment is the first posttest time investment in respect of which the sum of the amounts referred to in paragraphs (a) and (b) exceeds the amount of the principal--subsection (4) applies to the investment.

    * Reduced value for the purposes of working out value of inhouse assets

    * (4) For the purposes of working out the formula component **_Number of whole dollars in value of inhouse assets of the fund _**under section 75 at the posttest time, the value of the posttest time investment at the posttest time is taken to be the number of whole dollars in the amount worked out as follows:

    * where: 

    * **_excess amount_** means the amount of the excess under subsection (3).

    * **_market value of posttest time investment_** means the market value of the posttest time investment as at the posttest time.

    * **_purchase price of posttest time investment_** means the purchase price of the posttest time investment.

    * Effect of election

    * (5) If the trustee, or the trustees, of a fund make an election under paragraph (1)(e) in respect of the posttest time investments of the fund in an entity, then:

     * (a) sections 71A and 71D do not apply, and are taken never to have applied, to any posttest time investment by the fund in that entity; and

     * (b) this section applies, and is taken always to have applied, to any posttest time investment of the fund in that entity.

        * Note: This means that if a fund makes an election, this section would apply to all investments in the entity after the test time and before 1 July 2009, and sections 71A and 71D would not apply to such investments. 

    * Application of section to loans

    * (6) A reference in this section to an investment in a trust or company is taken to include a reference to a loan to a trust or company. For this purpose, the purchase price of the loan is taken to be the principal of the loan at the time at which the loan was made.

    * Acquiring fund taken to have always held asset

    * (3) For the purposes of applying this Subdivision to the asset at or after the time (the **_acquisition time_**) the trustee or investment manager of the acquiring fund acquires the asset, treat:

        * Note: This means that the trustees of both the transferring fund and the acquiring fund must retain, in accordance with subsection 103(2A), any election made under section 71E in relation to the transferring fund before the transfer of the asset.

    * (5) A person commits an offence if:

     * (a) the person is a trustee of the transferring fund; and

     * (b) just before the acquisition time, the trustee had a duty under subsection 103(2A) to retain an election, or a copy of an election, under section 71E in relation to the transferring fund; and

     * (d) make the declaration available for inspection by a member of the staff of the Regulator if requested to do so by a member of that staff.

        * Note: Section 166 imposes an administrative penalty for a contravention of subsection (2).

     * (b) those copies are made available for inspection by a member of the staff of the Regulator if requested to do so by a member of that staff.

        * Note: Section 166 imposes an administrative penalty for a contravention of subsection (1) in relation to a self managed superannuation fund.

    * (2) A trustee is guilty of an offence if the trustee contravenes subsection (1). This is an offence of strict liability.

      * Penalty: 50 penalty units.

        * Note 1: Chapter 2 of the _Criminal Code_ sets out the general principles of criminal responsibility.

        * Note 2: For **_strict liability_**, see section 6.1 of the _Criminal Code_.

    * (3) In this section:

    * **_member or beneficiary report _**means a report:

     * (a) given under this Act, the _Superannuation (Excluded Funds) Taxation Act 1987_ or the governing rules; and

     * (b) given in the same form (apart from differences relating to the names and addresses of the persons to whom the notices were given):

    * (3) Subsection (1) is a civil penalty provision as defined by section 193, and Part 21 therefore provides for civil and criminal consequences of contravening, or of being involved in a contravention of, that subsection.

    * Timing of notice

     * (b) if there is a group of individual trustees--to have member representatives included in the group; or

         * (C) retirement; or

         * (D) termination of employment; or

        * Note 2: For **_strict liability_**, see section 6.1 of the _Criminal Code_.

##### 108  Duty of trustee of employersponsored fund to establish procedure for appointing independent trustee or independent member of board of directors of corporate trustee

    * (1) This section applies if a standard employersponsored fund (other than a self managed superannuation fund) relies on subsection 89(2) in order to comply with the basic equal representation rules. (That subsection deals with an additional independent trustee or an additional independent director of a corporate trustee.)

    * (2) Each trustee of the fund must ensure that:

     * (a) rules are established (whether by inclusion in the governing rules or otherwise) ensuring that the additional independent trustee or additional independent director, as the case may be, can only be removed by the same procedure as that by which the additional independent trustee or additional independent director was appointed, except in the event of:

      * (i) death; or

      * (ii) mental or physical incapacity; or

      * (iia) the additional independent trustee or additional independent director no longer meeting one or more of the criteria for fitness and propriety relevant to the independent trustee or independent director set out in the prudential standards; or

      * (iii) the additional independent trustee or additional independent director, as the case may be, becoming a disqualified person within the meaning of Part 15; or

##### 108A  Trustee's duty to identify etc. multiple superannuation accounts of members

    * (1) Each trustee of a superannuation entity (other than the trustee of a pooled superannuation trust or a self managed superannuation fund) must ensure that rules are established, which:

     * (a) set out a procedure for identifying when a member of the superannuation entity has more than one superannuation account in the superannuation entity; and

     * (b) require the trustee to carry out the procedure to identify such members at least once each financial year; and

     * (c) if the member has 2 or more superannuation accounts in the superannuation entity--require the trustee to merge the accounts so that the member has only one account balance in respect of those accounts, if the trustee reasonably believes that it is in the best interests of the member to do so; and

     * (d) provide that fees are not payable (other than a buysell spread) for any merger of superannuation accounts that occurs as a result of paragraphs (a) to (c).

    * (2) The requirement in paragraph (1)(c) does not apply if:

     * (a) it is not practicable in the circumstances to merge the member's superannuation accounts; or

     * (b) one or more of the superannuation accounts is a defined benefit interest or income stream.

    * (3) A **_superannuation account _**is a record of the member's benefits, in relation to a superannuation entity in which the member has an interest, which is recorded separately:

     * (a) from other benefits of the member in relation to the entity (if any); and

     * (b) from other benefits of any other member in relation to the entity.

    * To avoid doubt, an FHSA (within the meaning of the _First Home Saver Accounts Act 2008_) is not a superannuation account.

        * Note: FHSA is short for first home saver account.

    * (4) In determining, for the purpose of paragraph (1)(c), whether it is in the best interests of a member to merge his or her superannuation accounts, the trustee must consider the total amount of fees and charges payable by the member in respect of all of his or her accounts in the superannuation entity (including any fees and charges payable by the member for insurance provided in respect of all of his or her accounts).

    * (5) A trustee commits an offence if the trustee contravenes subsection (1). This is an offence of strict liability.

      * Penalty: 50 penalty units.

        * Note 1: Chapter 2 of the _Criminal Code_ sets out the general principles of criminal responsibility.

        * Note 2: For strict liability, see section 6.1 of the _Criminal Code_.

##### 109  Investments of superannuation entity to be made and maintained on arm's length basis

    * (1) A trustee or investment manager of a superannuation entity must not invest in that capacity unless:

     * (a) the trustee or investment manager, as the case may be, and the other party to the relevant transaction are dealing with each other at arm's length in respect of the transaction; or

     * (b) both:

      * (i) the trustee or investment manager, as the case may be, and the other party to the relevant transaction are not dealing with each other at arm's length in respect of the transaction; and

      * (ii) the terms and conditions of the transaction are no more favourable to the other party than those which it is reasonable to expect would apply if the trustee or investment manager, as the case may be, were dealing with the other party at arm's length in the same circumstances.

    * (1A) If:

     * (a) a trustee or investment manager of a superannuation entity invests in that capacity; and

     * (b) at any time during the term of the investment the trustee or investment manager is required to deal in respect of the investment with another party that is not at arm's length with the trustee or investment manager;

    * the trustee or investment manager must deal with the other party in the same manner as if the other party were at arm's length with the trustee or investment manager.

    * (2) Subsections (1) and (1A) are civil penalty provisions as defined by section 193, and Part 21 therefore provides for civil and criminal consequences of contravening, or of being involved in a contravention of, those subsections.

    * (3) A contravention of subsection (1) or (1A) does not affect the validity of a transaction.

### Part 14--Other provisions applying to superannuation entities

     * (b) the governing rules are invalid, to the extent of the inconsistency.

##### 116  Agreement between trustee and investment manager

    * Despite anything in the governing rules of a superannuation entity, any provision of an agreement between a trustee of the entity and an investment manager that purports to exempt the investment manager from liability for negligence, or to limit that liability, is void. 

##### 117  Circumstances in which amounts may be paid out of an employersponsored fund to an employersponsor

    * Excluded superannuation funds

    * (2) On deciding an application for a declaration waiving the disqualified person status of a person to whom paragraphs 1(a), (b) and (c) apply:

     * (a) if the Regulator decides to make the declaration, the Act applies as if the person had never been disqualified; and

     * (b) if the Regulator decides not to make the declaration, the person again becomes a disqualified person from the date of the decision.

     * (a) a person is a disqualified person; and

     * (b) the person is eligible to make application for a declaration waiving his or her status as a disqualified person; and

     * (c) the person makes application for such a declaration under subsection 126B(4);

    * then: 

     * (d) pending the decision of the application the person continues to be a disqualified person for the purposes of this Act; but

     * (e) if the Regulator decides to make a declaration waiving the person's status as a disqualified person, the person is treated, for the purposes of this Act, as if the person had never been a disqualified person.

##### 126F  The Regulator's powers to seek further material

    * (1) If, to decide an application under subsection 126B(1), the Regulator needs:

     * (a) further information; or

     * (b) the applicant's consent to the Regulator making inquiries about the applicant from another person;

    * the Regulator may ask an applicant to provide information or consent.

    * (2) The Regulator may, by notice in writing, require a person who has made an application under subsection 126B(1) to pay to the Regulator an amount equal to the amount of any fees charged to the Regulator by any law enforcement agency, regulatory agency or court for answering any inquiry by the Regulator about the applicant if the fees:

     * (a) are of a kind prescribed for the purposes of this subsection; and

     * (b) exceed an amount prescribed for the purposes of this subsection, or exceed, in total, such an amount.

    * (3) The Regulator may, on the application of a person who has made an application under subsection 126B(1), waive in whole or in part, the requirement to pay an amount under subsection (2) if the Regulator is satisfied that there are special circumstances making it unfair to require the applicant to pay that amount or that part of that amount.

    * (4) If the applicant fails to comply with the request, the Regulator must treat the application as having been withdrawn.

    * (5) Nothing in this section or in section 126B prevents the Regulator from deciding an application before some or all of the requirements in subsection 126B(3) have been complied with.

    * (2) Financial assistance payable to a trustee of a fund is to be paid in such amounts, at such times, and in such manner, as the Minister determines.
