### An Act to change the law relating to royal succession and royal marriages, and for related purposes

##### [Assented to 24 March 2015]

#### Preamble

     * On 28 October 2011, representatives of nations of which Her Majesty is the Sovereign agreed that the rules on succession to, and possession of, the Crown should be changed so as to make succession not depend on gender and to end the disqualification arising from marrying a Roman Catholic.

     * The United Kingdom has further proposed to disqualify certain persons from succeeding to the Crown as a result of marriage, to repeal the _Royal Marriages Act 1772_ and to validate certain marriages made void by that Act.

     * For the purposes of paragraph 51(xxxviii) of the Constitution the Parliaments of all the States have requested the Parliament of the Commonwealth of Australia to enact an Act in the terms, or substantially in the terms, of this Act.

### The Parliament of Australia therefore enacts: 

### Part 1--Preliminary

     * (2) Any information in column 3 of the table is not part of this Act. Information may be inserted in this column, or information in it may be edited, in any published version of this Act.

##### 3  Object of this Act

     * The main object of this Act is to change the law relating to the effect of gender and marriage on royal succession, consistently with changes made to that law in the United Kingdom, so that the Sovereign of Australia is the same person as the Sovereign of the United Kingdom.

##### 6  Succession to the Crown not to depend on gender

### Part 3--Marriage and succession to the Crown

##### 7  Removal of disqualification arising from marriage to a Roman Catholic

     * (1) A person is not disqualified from succeeding to the Crown or from possessing it as a result of marrying a person of the Roman Catholic faith.

     * A person is disqualified from succeeding to the Crown if the person is disqualified by subsection 3(3) of the _Succession to the Crown Act 2013_ of the United Kingdom, as in force at the commencement of this section, from succeeding to the Crown in right of the United Kingdom.

##### 9  Amendments and repeal relating to marriage and succession to the Crown

     * Each Act of England or Great Britain that is specified in Schedule 1, so far as that Act is part of the law of the Commonwealth, a State or a Territory, is amended or repealed as set out in the applicable items in Schedule 1, and any other item in Schedule 1 has effect according to its terms.

### Part 4--Other modifications of parts of the law of the Commonwealth, States and Territories

##### 10  References to Bill of Rights and Act of Settlement

     * References, however expressed, in any law that forms part of the law of the Commonwealth or a Territory, to the provisions of the Bill of Rights or the Act of Settlement relating to succession to, or possession of, the Crown are to be read as including references to the provisions of this Act.
