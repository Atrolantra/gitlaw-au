   * (4) The arrangement referred to in the last preceding subsection, or a supplementary arrangement, may provide for the amounts to be paid by the Commonwealth or the State, or both, as remuneration to the person appointed as Commonwealth Statistician, and for payments by the Commonwealth to the State by way of reimbursement of amounts so paid by the State, and for any other matters incidental to the matters arranged by virtue of that subsection.

   * (5) The _Commonwealth Employees' Furlough Act 1943-1953 _does not apply to a person appointed as Commonwealth Statistician in accordance with a provision included in an arrangement by virtue of subsection (3) of this section in respect of the period during which he continues to hold office as Government Statistician of the State.

   * (6) A person referred to in the last preceding subsection shall be deemed to be an employee within the meaning of the _Commonwealth Employees' Compensation Act 1930-1954_.

   * (7) Nothing in this section affects the operation of any other law providing for the making of arrangements between the Governor-General and the Governor of a State.

   * (8) Notwithstanding section ninety-one of the Public Service Act, an officer of the Public Service of the Commonwealth may, in pursuance of an arrangement under this section, accept or continue to hold an office in the Public Service of a State or otherwise under the law of a State.

##### 6  Election by State employees

   * (1) The Board may request a State employee to elect, by writing addressed to the Board, within the period of twenty-one days after being so requested or within such further period as the Board within the first-mentioned period allows, to be appointed to, or engaged for employment in, the Public Service of the Commonwealth.

   * (2) Such an appointment shall be without examination and without probation.

##### 8  Employment of State temporary employees

   * (1) Where a State employee to whom a request is made under section six of this Act, being a person employed in a temporary capacity, elects, within the prescribed period, to be engaged under this Act, the Board may engage that employee for temporary employment in the Public Service of the Commonwealth.

   * (2) Section eighty-two of the Public Service Act, but not including subsections (1) and (2) of that section, applies in relation to the employment of such an employee.

##### 10  Rate of remuneration

   * (1) Subject to this section, the provisions of Division 6 of Part III of the Public Service Act relating to the reduction in, or suspension of, remuneration payable to an officer, the _Commonwealth Employees (Redeployment and Retirement) Act 1979 _and to any law providing for a reduction in the remuneration payable to officers of the Public Service of the Commonwealth generally, the rate of remuneration of a State employee appointed or engaged under this Act shall, while he continues in the Public Service of the Commonwealth, be not less favourable than that to which, in the opinion of the Board, he would have been entitled in respect of the normal position which he occupied in the State Public Service immediately before his appointment or engagement under this Act.

   * (2) Where, by virtue of the last preceding subsection, the remuneration to which a person is entitled would or might be increased by reason of an increment of salary in respect of the normal position which he occupied in the State Public Service, his entitlement to the increase is subject to the provisions of the regulations under the Public Service Act, and of the determinations in force under subsection 9(7A) or section 82D of that Act that are applicable to him, relating to increments of salary.

   * (3) For the purposes of this section, **_remuneration_** means salary or pay, and includes such allowances as, in the opinion of the Board, should be regarded as having formed part of the salary or pay of the officer or employee in his normal position in the State Public Service.

##### 13  Preservation of sick leave credits

   * A State employee shall, upon his being appointed or engaged under this Act, be credited with the eligibility for sick leave for which he would have been eligible if he had been continuously employed as a permanent officer in the Public Service of the Commonwealth for the period of his continuous service (both permanent and temporary) in the State Public Service (including any service deemed under the law of the State to have been continuous service) or in the service of the State and of the Commonwealth, less any leave of absence on account of illness granted since the commencement of that period or since the nineteenth day of July, One thousand nine hundred and sixteen, whichever is the later.

   * (1) Where a State employee was, immediately before his being appointed or engaged under this Act, entitled to, or eligible for, the grant of furlough or pay in lieu of furlough (including pay to his dependants on his death) after a period of continuous service specified in the law of the State in which he was employed, he or his dependants, as the case may be, shall, after the expiration of that period of continuous service, be entitled to, or eligible for, a grant by the Public Service Board of furlough or pay in lieu of furlough for a period equal to the period to or for which he would have been entitled or eligible if he had continued to be employed in the State Public Service and his service with the Commonwealth were reckoned as service in the State Public Service.

   * (3) Where a State employee is granted furlough or pay in lieu of furlough as provided in subsection (1) of this section or has been, before being so appointed or engaged under this Act, granted furlough or pay in lieu of furlough under the law referred to in that subsection, the period of the furlough so granted, or the period in respect of which the pay is or was granted, as the case may be, shall be deducted from any period of leave for which he is eligible or in respect of which payment may be authorized under the provisions of the _Long Service Leave (Commonwealth Employees) Act 1976_.

   * (4) Where a State employee:

    * (a) has, before 20 December 1976, been granted furlough or pay in lieu of furlough under the Public Service Act or under the _Commonwealth Employees' Furlough Act 1943_; or

    * (b) is, on or after 20 December 1976, granted long service leave or pay in lieu of long service leave under the _Long Service Leave (Commonwealth Employees) Act 1976_;

   * the period of the leave so granted, or the period in respect of which the pay is granted, as the case may be, shall be deducted from any period of furlough for the grant of which he is entitled or eligible, or from any period in respect of which he is entitled to or eligible for pay in lieu of furlough, under subsection (1).

   * (6) Calculations for the purposes of this section shall be made on the basis of furlough on full salary, and any period of furlough on half salary shall be treated as a period of furlough on full salary equal to half that period.

   * (7) For the purposes of this section, **_furlough_** includes long leave of absence, long service leave, extended leave and any other leave of absence in the nature of furlough.

##### 15  Preservation of gratuity rights

   * (1) Where a State employee appointed under this Act would, if he had continued in the State Public Service until retirement from that service and had so retired in any particular circumstances, have been entitled under a law of the State enacted prior to the commencement of this Act to receive an amount by way of gratuity, he is entitled to receive from the Commonwealth that amount by way of gratuity upon his retirement from the Public Service of the Commonwealth in corresponding circumstances.

   * (2) In the event of the death of such a State employee before retirement, such amount as would have been payable to any other person under the provisions relating to gratuities of that law of the State is payable by the Commonwealth to that other person.

##### 16  Superannuation rights

   * (1) In the case of a State employee appointed or engaged under this Act who was, immediately before his appointment or engagement, a contributor to a State Fund as defined by section sixty AN of the _Superannuation Act 1922-1955_:

    * (a) section sixty AV of that Act does not apply;

    * (b) Part IVD of that Act, but not including subsection (4) of section sixty AO, applies as if he were a State employee for the purposes of that Part and, for that purpose, section sixty AO shall be deemed to have no application in relation to reserve units of pension in respect of which the State employee was contributing to the State Fund; and

    * (c) if he is a State employee engaged under this Act for temporary employment, he may make an election and payment under section sixty AO of that Act as if he had become an employee upon the date of that engagement and, upon making such an election and payment, he shall be deemed to have become an employee upon the date of that engagement.

   * (2) Where a State employee makes an election and payment in accordance with section sixty AO of the _Superannuation Act 1922-1955_, the following provisions apply:

    * (a) if the State employee has, at the date on which he is appointed or engaged under this Act, attained the age of forty years and was contributing to the State Fund for the maximum pension for which he could have been so contributing, he shall be deemed to be a contributor to whom paragraph (a) of subsection (4) of section thirteen of the _Superannuation Act 1922-1955 _applies;

    * (b) if the State employee has attained the age of forty years at that date and was not contributing to the State Fund for the maximum pension for which he could have been so contributing, he shall be deemed to be a contributor to whom paragraph (b) of subsection (4) of section thirteen of the _Superannuation Act 1922-1955 _applies and, if he does not elect under subparagraph (i) or (ii) of that paragraph, he shall be deemed to be a contributor to whom paragraph (c) of that subsection applies;

    * (c) for the purposes of the provisions applied by the preceding paragraphs of this subsection, the salary of the employee upon his appointment or engagement under this Act shall be deemed to be his increased salary; and
