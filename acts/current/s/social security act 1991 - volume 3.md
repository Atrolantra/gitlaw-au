## Chapter 3--General provisions relating to payability and rates

### Part 3.6--Benefit Rate Calculator B

##### 1068  Rate of widow allowance, Newstart allowance (18 or over) sickness allowance (18 or over) partner allowance, and mature age allowance under Part 2.12B

    * (1) The rate of:

      * (a) newstart allowance; or

      * (b) sickness allowance; or

      * (c) partner allowance; or

      * (ca) mature age allowance under Part 2.12B; or

      * (d) widow allowance;

    * is to be calculated in accordance with the Rate Calculator at the end of this section.

         * Note: Module A of the Rate Calculator establishes the overall rate calculation process and the remaining Modules provide for the calculation of the component amounts used in the overall rate calculation.

    * (2) If:

      * (a) a person has a relationship with another person, whether of the same sex or a different sex (**_other person_**); and

      * (b) the relationship between them is a de facto relationship in the Secretary's opinion (formed after the Secretary has had regard to all the circumstances of the relationship, including, in particular, the matters referred to in paragraphs 4(3)(a) to (e) and subsection 4(3A));

      * (c) the other person is under the age of consent applicable in the State or Territory in which the person is living;

    * the person's benefit rate is not to exceed the rate at which it would be payable to the person if the other person were the person's partner.

         * Note: This provision has the effect of taking into account the ordinary income and assets of the partner in applying the ordinary income test and assets test respectively.

    * Rate of benefit limited for certain armed services widows

    * (3) If:

      * (a) an armed services widow is receiving a pension under Part II or IV of the Veterans' Entitlements Act at a rate determined under or by reference to subsection 30(1) of that Act; and

      * (b) the widow has been receiving a payment referred to in paragraph (a) continuously since before 1 November 1986; and

      * (c) before 1 November 1986 the widow was also receiving a social security benefit;

    * the rate of benefit payable to the widow is not to be increased: 

      * (d) if, immediately before 1 November 1986, the widow was receiving a social security benefit at a rate less than $124.90 per fortnight--to a rate greater than $124.90 per fortnight; or

      * (e) if, immediately before 1 November 1986, the widow was receiving a social security benefit at a rate equal to or greater than $124.90 per fortnight--to a rate greater than the rate at which it was payable immediately before 1 November 1986.

         * Note 1: A benefit is not payable to a widow who starts to get a payment referred to in subsection (3) after 1 November 1986--see sections 408CF, 614, 660YCF and 771HI.

         * Note 2: For **_armed services widow_** see subsection 4(1).

#### Benefit Rate Calculator B

#### Module A--Overall rate calculation process

    * Method of calculating rate

    * 1068A1	The rate of benefit is a daily rate. That rate is worked out by dividing the fortnightly rate calculated according to this Rate Calculator by 14.

Method statement

       * Step 1.	Work out the person's **_maximum basic rate_** using MODULE B below.

       * Step 1A.	Work out the pension supplement amount (if any) using Module BA below.

       * Step 1B.	Work out the energy supplement (if any) using Module C below.

       * Step 2.	Work out the amount per fortnight (if any) of pharmaceutical allowance using MODULE D below.

       * Step 3.	Work out the applicable amount per fortnight (if any) for rent assistance in accordance with paragraph 1070A(a).

       * Step 4.	Add up the amounts obtained in Step to 4: the result is called the **_maximum payment rate_**.

       * Step 5.	Apply the income test using MODULE G below to work out the income reduction.

       * Step 6.	Take the income reduction away from the maximum payment rate: the result is called the **_provisional fortnightly payment rate_**.

       * Step 7.	The **_rate of benefit _**is the amount obtained by:

         * (a) subtracting from the provisional fortnightly payment rate any special employment advance deduction (see Part 3.16B); and

         * (b) if there is any amount remaining, subtracting from that amount any advance payment deduction (see Part 3.16A); and

         * (c) except where the person is a CDEP Scheme participant in respect of the whole or a part of the period for which the rate of benefit is being worked out, adding any amount payable by way of remote area allowance (see Module J).

         * Note 1: If a person's rate is reduced under step 6, the order in which the reduction is to be made against the components of the maximum payment rate is laid down by section 1210.

         * Note 2: In some circumstances a person may also be qualified for a pharmaceutical allowance under Part 2.22.

         * Note 3: An amount of remote area allowance is to be added under paragraph (c) of step 7 only if the conditions in point 1068J1 are satisfied.

#### Module B--Maximum basic rate

    * Maximum basic rate

    * 1068B1	The maximum basic rate of a person other than a person who is a CDEP Scheme participant in respect of the whole or a part of the period for which the maximum basic rate is being worked out is worked out using Table B. Work out the person's family situation and whether the person has a dependent child or not. The maximum basic rate is the corresponding amount in the **_rate_** column. The maximum basic rate of a person who is a CDEP Scheme participant in respect of the whole or a part of the period for which the maximum basic rate is being worked out is nil (see sections 408CG, 614A, 660YCH and 771HK).

         * Note 1: For **_member of couple_**, **_partnered_**, **_illness separated couple_** and **_partnered (partner in gaol)_** see section 4.

         * Note 2: For **_dependent child_** see section 5.

#### Module G--Income test

    * Effect of ordinary income on maximum payment rate

    * 1068G1	This is how to work out the effect of a person's ordinary income, and the ordinary income of a partner of the person, on the person's maximum payment rate:

Method statement

       * Step 1.	Work out the amount of the person's ordinary income on a fortnightly basis.

             * Note: For the treatment of amounts received from friendly societies, see point 1068G4.

       * Step 2.	If the person is a member of a couple, work out the partner income free area using point 1068G9.

             * Note: The partner income free area is the maximum amount of ordinary income the person's partner may have without affecting the person's benefit.

       * Step 3.	Use paragraph068G10(a), (b) and (c) to work out whether the person has a partner income excess.

       * Step 4.	If the requirements of paragraph068G10(a), (b) and (c) are not satisfied then the person's partner income excess is nil.

       * Step 5.	If the requirements of paragraph068G10(a), (b) and (c) are satisfied, the person's partner income excess is the partner's ordinary income less the partner income free area.

       * Step 6.	Use the person's partner income excess to work out the person's **_partner income reduction_** using point 1068G11.

       * Step 7.	Work out whether the person's ordinary income exceeds the person's ordinary income free area under point 1068G12.

             * Note: A person's ordinary income free area is the maximum amount of ordinary income the person may have without affecting the person's benefit rate.

       * Step 8.	If the person's ordinary income does not exceed the person's ordinary income free area, the person's ordinary income excess is nil.

       * Step 9.	If the person's ordinary income exceeds the person's ordinary income free area, the person's ordinary income excess is the person's ordinary income less the person's ordinary income free area.

       * Step 10.	Use the person's ordinary income excess to work out the person's **_ordinary income reduction_** using point068G14, 1068G15, 1068G16 and 1068G17.

       * Step 11.	Add the person's partner income reduction and ordinary income reduction: the result is the person's **_income reduction_** referred to in Step 5 of point 1068A1.

         * Note 1: For **_ordinary income_** see section 8.

         * Note 2: See point 1068A1 (Steps 6 to 9) for the significance of the person's income reduction.

         * Note 3: The application of the ordinary income test is affected by provisions concerning:

the general concept of ordinary income (sections 1072 and 1073);

    * 1068G2	Subject to point 1068G3, if a person is a member of a couple and the person's partner is receiving a social security pension, a service pension or income support supplement, the person's ordinary income is taken to be one half of the sum of:

      * (a) the amount that would be the person's ordinary income if he or she were not a member of a couple; and

      * (b) the amount that would be the ordinary income of the person's partner if the partner were not a member of a couple.

    * Friendly society amounts

    * 1068G4	The ordinary income of a person: 

      * (a) to whom, or to whose partner, sickness allowance is payable; or

      * (c) to whom, or to whose partner, newstart allowance is payable and who, or whose partner, under Subdivision BA of Division 1 of Part 2.12, is not required to satisfy the activity test;

    * is not to include any amount received by the person or partner from an approved friendly society in respect of the incapacity because of which the person or partner is qualified for the sickness allowance or is not required to satisfy the activity test, as the case may be.

    * 1068G7AP	If a person who is covered by point 1068G7AH receives a single payment in respect of different kinds of termination payments, then, for the purposes of the application of points 1068G7AG to 1068G7AN (inclusive), each part of the payment that is in respect of a different kind of termination payment is taken to be a separate payment and the income maintenance period in respect of the single payment is worked out by adding the periods to which the separate payments relate.

    * Definitions

    * 1068G7AQ	In points 1068G7AG to 1068G7AP (inclusive):

    * **_payment fortnight_** means a fortnight in respect of which a sickness allowance or a newstart allowance, as the case requires, is paid, or would be paid, apart from the application of an income maintenance period, to a person.

      * (c) if the payment is a termination payment and paragraph (b) does not apply--the period of weeks (rounded down to the nearest whole number) in respect of which the person would have received ordinary income, from the employment that was terminated, of an amount equal to the amount of the termination payment if:

       * (i) the person's employment had continued; and

       * (ii) the person received ordinary income from the employment at the rate per week at which the person usually received ordinary income from the employment prior to the termination.

    * Claimant or recipient receives lump sum amount for remunerative work

    * 1068G7B	If a person whose claim for an allowance has been granted receives a lump sum amount after the claim was made that: 

      * (a) is paid to him or her in relation to remunerative work; and

      * (b) is not a payment to which point 1068G8 applies; and

      * (c) is not an exempt lump sum;

      * (a) a person receives a number of ordinary income payments; and

      * (b) each payment is in respect of a period (in this point called the **_work period_**) that is greater than a fortnight; and

      * (c) there is reasonable predictability or regularity as to the timing of the payments; and

      * (d) there is reasonable predictability as to the quantum of the payments;

    * the person is taken to receive in a fortnight falling within, or overlapping with, a work period an amount calculated by:

      * (e) dividing the amount received by the number of days in the work period (the result is called the**_ daily rate_**); and

      * (f) multiplying the daily rate by the number of days in the fortnight that are also within the work period.

     * EXAMPLE OF HOW ORDINARY INCOME RECEIVED AT INTERVALS LONGER THAN A FORTNIGHT IS ALLOCATED TO FORTNIGHTLY PERIODS	

         * _Facts:	_Fred receives $600 each 25 days from remunerative work. The social security benefit becomes payable to Fred such that the first 25 days of his earnings that are counted as ordinary income for the purposes of the ordinary income test are spread over 3 social security benefit payment fortnights as follows:

         * 5 days of the first fortnight;

         * all of the second fortnight;

         * 6 days of the third fortnight.

         * In this example, it is assumed that Fred remains qualified for the social security benefit during the three fortnights and that nothing prevents it from being payable to him. The problem is then to work out what proportion of Fred's earnings to allocate to each fortnight for ordinary income testing purposes.

         * _Application:	_To work out the amount that Fred is taken to receive in the first fortnight first divide the total amount received for the 25 day work period ($600) by the number of days in the work period (25). This gives a daily rate. The daily rate is:

         * Then multiply the daily rate ($24) by the number of days in the fortnight that are also within the work period. The result is:

         * For the second fortnight the calculation is: 

         * For the third fortnight the calculation is: 

         * plus

         * Note that the amount of $192 added for the third fortnight comes from the given fact that Fred receives $600 each 25 days. So, for as long as there is reasonable predictability as to the timing and quantum of Fred's ordinary income from remunerative work where receipt is at intervals longer than a fortnight, then this provision should be used to allocate that income to fortnightly periods for the purposes of the ordinary income test.

    * Payment of arrears of periodic compensation payments

    * 1068G8A	If: 

      * (a) at the time of an event that gives rise to an entitlement of a person to compensation, the person is receiving newstart allowance, sickness allowance, or mature age allowance under Part 2.12B; and

      * (b) in relation to that entitlement, the person receives a payment of arrears of periodic compensation;

    * the person is taken to receive in a fortnight falling within, or overlapping with, the periodic payments period, an amount calculated by:

      * (c) dividing the amount received by the number of days in the periodic payments period (the result is called the**_ daily rate_**); and

      * (d) multiplying the daily rate by the number of days in the fortnight that are also within the periodic payments period.

         * Note: For **_periodic payments period_** see section 17.

    * Partner income free area

    * 1068G9	The partner income free area for a person is: 

      * (a) if the person's partner is not receiving a social security benefit and has not turned 22--the amount of income of the partner (rounded up to the nearest dollar) beyond which youth allowance would not be payable to the partner if the partner were qualified for a youth allowance and were not undertaking fulltime study (see section 541B); or

      * (b) if the person's partner is not receiving a social security benefit and has turned 22--the amount of income of the partner (rounded up to the nearest dollar) beyond which newstart allowance would not be payable to the partner if the partner were qualified for a newstart allowance; or

      * (c) if the person's partner is receiving a social security benefit--the amount of income of the partner (rounded up to the nearest dollar) beyond which that benefit would not be payable to the partner.

         * Facts: _Susan's partner Colin has an ordinary income of $800. Assume that the partner income free area under point 1068G9 is $640.

         * _Application:	_Colin's ordinary income exceeds the partner income free area. He therefore has a partner income excess under point 1068G10 of:

         * Susan's partner income reduction under point 1068G11 is therefore:

    * Ordinary income free area

    * 1068G12	A person's ordinary income free area is $100.

         * Note 1: The amount specified is indexed in line with CPI increases (see sections 1190 to 1194).

         * Note 2: The income free area is used in the ordinary income test in relation to fortnightly income.

    * Ordinary income excess

    * 1068G13	If a person's ordinary income exceeds the person's ordinary income free area:

      * (a) the person has an ordinary income excess; and

    * Ordinary income reduction--general

    * 1068G14	Subject to point 1068G17, if a person has an ordinary income excess, the person's ordinary income reduction is the sum of:

      * (a) the person's lower range reduction (see point 1068G15); and

      * (b) the person's upper range reduction (if any) (see point 1068G16).

    * Lower range reduction

    * 1068G15	The person's lower range reduction is an amount equal to 50% of the part of the person's ordinary income excess that does not exceed $150.

    * Upper range reduction

    * 1068G16	The person's upper range reduction is an amount equal to 60% of the part (if any) of the person's ordinary income excess that exceeds $150.

    * Ordinary income reduction for certain recipients of newstart allowance

    * 1068G17	If: 

      * (a) a person has an ordinary income excess; and

#### Pension PP (Single) Rate Calculator

#### Module A--Overall rate calculation process

    * Method of calculating rate

    * 1068AA1	The rate of pension PP (single) is a daily rate. That rate is worked out by dividing the annual rate calculated according to this Rate Calculator by 364 (fortnightly rates are provided for information only).

Method statement

       * Step 1.	Work out the person's **_maximum basic rate _**using Module B below.

       * Step 1A.	Work out the amount of pension supplement using Module BA below.

       * Step 1B.	Work out the energy supplement (if any) using Module BB below.

       * Step 2.	Work out the amount per year (if any) of pharmaceutical allowance using Module C below.

       * Step 3.	Work out the amount per year (if any) for rent assistance in accordance with paragraph 1070A(b).

       * Step 4.	Add up the amounts obtained in Step, 1A, 1B, 2 and 3: the result is called the **_maximum payment rate_**.

       * Step 5.	Apply the ordinary income test using Module E below to work out the income reduction.

       * Step 6.	Take the income reduction away from the maximum payment rate: the result is called the **_provisional annual payment rate_**.

       * Step 7.	The **_rate of pension PP (single) _**is the amount obtained by:

         * (a) subtracting from the provisional annual payment rate any special employment advance deduction (see Part 3.16B); and

         * (b) if there is any amount remaining, subtracting from that amount any advance payment deduction (see Part 3.16A); and

         * (c) adding any amount payable by way of remote area allowance (see Module F).

         * Note 1: If a person's rate is reduced under Step 6, the order in which the reduction is to be made against the components of the maximum payment rate is laid down by section 1210.

         * Note 2: In some circumstances a person may also be qualified for a pharmaceutical allowance under Part 2.22.

         * Note 3: An amount of remote area allowance is to be added under Step 7 only if the person's provisional payment rate under Step 6 is greater than nil.

    * (2) The period ends after the number of paydays worked out using the following formula have passed:

    * where: 

    * **_amount of advance_** is the amount of the advance paid to the person.

    * **_pharmaceutical allowance rate_** is the yearly amount of pharmaceutical allowance which would be added to the person's maximum basic rate in working out the person's rate of pension PP (single) on the day on which the advance is paid if pharmaceutical allowance were to be added to the person's maximum basic rate on that day.

    * No pharmaceutical allowance if annual limit reached

#### Module E--Ordinary income test

    * Effect of income on maximum payment rate

    * 1068AE1	This is how to work out the effect of a person's ordinary income on the person's maximum payment rate:

Method statement

       * Step 1.	Work out the amount of the person's ordinary income on a yearly basis.

       * Step 2.	Work out the person's ordinary income free area (see point068AE14 to 1068AE18 below).

##### 1068B  Rate of parenting payment--PP (partnered)

    * (1) If a person is a member of a couple, the person's rate of parenting payment is the benefit PP (partnered) rate.

    * (2) The benefit PP (partnered) rate is worked out in accordance with the rate calculator at the end of this section.

         * Note: For **_member of a couple_** see section 4.

#### Benefit PP (Partnered) Rate Calculator

#### Module A--Overall rate calculation process

    * Method of calculating rate--general

    * 1068BA1	The rate of benefit PP (partnered) is a daily rate. That rate is worked out by dividing the fortnightly rate calculated according to this Rate Calculator by 14. There are 2 ways of working out the fortnightly rate:

      * (a) one for a person who is not a partner of a nonindependent YA recipient (see point 1068BA2); and

      * (b) one for a person who is a partner of a nonindependent YA recipient (see point 1068BA3).

         * Note: For **_partner of a nonindependent YA recipient_** see subsection 23(1).

    * Method of calculating rate for person who is not a partner of a nonindependent YA recipient

    * 1068BA2	If a person is not the partner of a nonindependent YA recipient, the fortnightly rate of benefit PP (partnered) for the person is worked out as follows:

Method statement

       * Step 1.	Work out the person's **_maximum basic rate_** using Module C below.

       * Step 2.	Work out the amount per fortnight (if any) of rent assistance in accordance with paragraph 1070A(a).

       * Step 2A.	Work out the pension supplement amount (if any) using Module DA below.

       * Step 2B.	Work out the energy supplement (if any) using Module DB below.

       * Step 3.	Work out the amount per fortnight (if any) of pharmaceutical allowance using Module E below.

       * Step 4.	Add up the amounts obtained in step to 3: the result is called the **_maximum payment rate_**.

       * Step 5.	Apply the income test using Module D below to work out the person's income reduction.

       * Step 6.	Take the income reduction away from the maximum payment rate: the result is called the **_provisional payment rate_**.

       * Step 7.	The rate of benefit PP (partnered) is the difference between:

         * (a) the provisional payment rate; and

         * (b) any advance payment deduction (see Part 3.16A);

       * plus, except where the person is a CDEP Scheme participant in respect of the whole or part of the period for which the rate of payment is being worked out, any amount by way of remote area allowance that, under Module G, is to be added to the person's rate of benefit PP (partnered).

         * Note 1: For **_partner of a nonindependent YA recipient_** see subsection 23(1).

         * Note 2: If a person's rate is reduced under step 6, the order in which the reduction is to be made against the components of the maximum payment rate is laid down by section 1210 (maximum basic rate first, then rent assistance).

    * Method of calculating rate for partner of a nonindependent YA recipient

    * 1068BA3	If a person is the partner of a nonindependent YA recipient, the fortnightly rate of benefit PP (partnered) for the person is worked out as follows:

Method statement

       * Step 1.	Work out the person's **_maximum basic rate_** using Module C below.

       * Step 2.	Work out the amount per fortnight (if any) of rent assistance in accordance with paragraph 1070A(a).

       * Step 2A.	Work out the pension supplement amount (if any) using Module DA below.

       * Step 2B.	Work out the energy supplement (if any) using Module DB below.

       * Step 3.	Work out the amount per fortnight (if any) of pharmaceutical allowance using Module E below.

       * Step 4.	Add up the amounts obtained in step to 3: the result is called the **_maximum payment rate_**.

       * Step 5.	Apply the income test using Module E of the Rate Calculator in section 1068A to work out the person's income reduction.

       * Step 6.	Take the income reduction away from the maximum payment rate: the rate is called the **_provisional payment rate_**.

       * Step 7.	The rate of benefit is the difference between:

         * (a) the provisional payment rate; and

         * (b) any advance payment deduction (see Part 3.16A);

       * plus, except where the person is a CDEP Scheme participant in respect of the whole or part of the period for which the rate of payment is being worked out, any amount by way of remote area allowance that, under Module G, is to be added to the person's rate of benefit PP (partnered).

         * Note 1: For **_partner of a nonindependent YA recipient_** see subsection 23(1).

         * Note 2: If a person's rate is reduced under step 6, the order in which the reduction is to be made against the components of the maximum payment rate is laid down by section 1210 (maximum basic rate first, then rent assistance).

#### Module C--Maximum basic rate

    * Maximum basic rate

    * 1068BC2	If a person is not a CDEP Scheme participant in respect of the whole or part of the period for which the rate of payment is being worked out, the person's maximum basic rate is worked out using Table C. Work out the person's family situation. The maximum basic rate is the corresponding amount in Column 3.

         * Note 1: For **_illness separated couple_**,**_ respite care couple_** and **_partnered (partner in gaol)_** see section 4.

         * Note 2: The rates are indexed 6 monthly in line with CPI increases (see sections 1191 to 1194).

    * Maximum basic rate--CDEP Scheme participant

    * 1068BC3	The maximum basic rate of a person who is a CDEP Scheme participant in respect of the whole or a part of the period for which the maximum basic rate is being worked out is nil (see section 500W).

#### Module D--Income test

    * Effect of income on maximum payment rate

    * 1068BD1	This is how to work out the effect of a person's ordinary income, and the ordinary income of the person's partner, on the person's maximum payment rate:

Method statement

       * Step 1.	Work out the amount of the person's ordinary income on a fortnightly basis.

             * Note: The amount of the person's ordinary income is affected by point068BD2 to 1068BD21.

       * Step 2.	Work out the partner income free area using point 1068BD22.

             * Note: The partner income free area is the maximum amount of ordinary income the person's partner can have without affecting the person's rate.

       * Step 3.	Use point 1068BD23 to work out the person's partner income excess.

       * Step 4.	Use the person's partner income excess to work out the person's partner income reduction using point 1068BD24.

       * Step 5.	Work out whether the person's ordinary income exceeds the person's ordinary income free area (see point 1068BD27).

             * Note: A person's ordinary income free area is the maximum amount of ordinary income the person can have without affecting the person's rate.

       * Step 6.	If the person's ordinary income does not exceed the person's ordinary income free area, the person's ordinary income excess is nil.

       * Step 7.	If the person's ordinary income exceeds the person's ordinary income free area, the person's ordinary income excess is the person's ordinary income less the person's ordinary income free area.

       * Step 8.	Use the person's ordinary income excess to work out the person's **_ordinary income reduction_** using point068BD29 to 1068BD31.

       * Step 9.	Add the person's ordinary income reduction and partner income reduction: the result is the person's income reduction referred to in step 5 of the method statement in point 1068BA2.

         * Note 1: For **_ordinary income_** see section 8.

         * Note 2: See point 1068BA2 (step 6) for the significance of the person's income reduction.

    * Ordinary income of members of certain couples

    * 1068BD2	If a person's partner is receiving a social security pension, a service pension or income support supplement, the person's ordinary income is taken to be one half of the sum of:

      * (a) the amount that would be the person's ordinary income if he or she were not a member of a couple; and

      * (b) the amount that would be the ordinary income of the person's partner if the partner were not a member of a couple.

    * Friendly society amounts

    * 1068BD4	The ordinary income of a person to whose partner a sickness allowance is payable is not to include any amount received by the person from an approved friendly society in respect of the incapacity because of which the partner is qualified for the sickness allowance.

       * Step 3.	Work out under section 1077 the amount of ordinary income the couple would be taken to receive per year on the financial assets:

         * (a) on the assumption that section 1077 applied to the person and the person's partner; and

         * (b) on the assumption that the only financial assets of the person and the person's partner were the financial assets referred to in steps 1 and 2; and

    * 107112	A person's seniors health card income limit is worked out using the Seniors Health Card Income Limit Table. Work out which family situation in the table applies to the person. The person's seniors health card income limit is the corresponding amount in column 3 plus an additional corresponding amount in column 4 for each dependent child of the person.

         * Note: The amounts in column 3 are to be indexed on 20 September 2014 and each later 20 September in line with CPI increases (see sections 1190 to 1194).

    * Longterm financial asset

    * 107113	For the purposes of this Part, a **_longterm financial asset _**is:

      * (a) a financial investment within the meaning of paragraph (i) of the definition of **_financial investment _**in subsection 9(1), where the assettested income stream (long term) arises under a complying superannuation plan (within the meaning of the _Income Tax Assessment Act 1997_) that is not a constitutionally protected fund (within the meaning of that Act); or

      * (b) a financial investment within the meaning of paragraph (j) of the definition of **_financial investment _**in subsection 9(1).

         * Note: Schedule 7 to the _Social Services and Other Legislation Amendment (2014 Budget Measures No. 6) Act 2014_ preserves the rules in this Calculator for a certain kind of longterm financial asset that was being provided to a person immediately before 1 January 2015 where the person held a seniors health card immediately before that day provided that, since that day, the person has held a seniors health card.

### Part 3.9A--Health Care Card Income Test Calculator

##### 1071A  Health care card income test

    * The Health Care Card Income Test Calculator at the end of this section is to be used in working out whether a person satisfies the health care card income test for the purposes of Division 3 of Part 2A.1.

#### Health Care Card Income Test Calculator

    *  Satisfying the health care card income test: persons claiming a card

    * 1071A1	This is how to work out whether a person claiming a health care card satisfies the health care card income test on the day on which the person claims the card, whether or not the person is the holder of a health care card at that time.

Method statement

       * Step 1.	Work out the amount of the person's ascertained income for the period of 8 weeks ending on the day on which the person lodged the claim.

       * Step 2.	Work out the amount of the person's allowable income for the period.

       * Step 3.	If the person's ascertained income for the period is less than the person's allowable income for the period, the person satisfies the health care card income test.

       * Step 4.	If the person's ascertained income for the period equals or exceeds the person's allowable income for the period, the person does not satisfy the health care card income test.

    *  Satisfying the health care card income test: cardholders

    * 1071A2	This is how to work out whether a person who holds a health care card satisfies the health care card income test at a particular time where there has been a change in circumstances.

Method statement

       * Step 1.	Work out the amount of the person's ascertained income for the period of 8 weeks ending on the day on which the change of circumstances occurred.

       * Step 2.	Work out the amount of the person's allowable income for the period.

       * Step 3.	If the person's ascertained income for the period is less than 125% of the person's allowable income for that period, the person satisfies the health care card income test.

       * Step 4.	If the person's ascertained income for the period i25% or more of the person's allowable income for that period, the person does not satisfy the health care card income test.

    * Cessation of dependency

    * 1071A3	For the purposes of point 1071A2, if a person (the **_first person_**) ceases to be a dependant of another person who is the holder of a health care card:

      * (a) the fact that the first person has so ceased is to be disregarded for a period of 4 weeks commencing on the day on which the first person so ceased; and

      * (b) if, at the end of the period, the first person has not become again a dependant of that other person, the first person is taken to have ceased to be a dependant of the other person at the expiration of that period of 4 weeks.

    * Definitions

    * 1071A4	In this Part: 

    * **_allowable income_**, in relation to any period of 8 weeks, means:

      * (a) in relation to a person who had a dependant or dependants on the last day of the period--the amount worked out by multiplying by 8, or such other number as is prescribed, the aggregate of:

       * (i) the amount of the weekly rate of income that would, on the last day of the period, be sufficient to prevent both members of a oneincome couple from receiving newstart allowance; and

       * (ii) $20, or such other amount as is prescribed; and

       * (iii) an amount worked out by multiplying $34, or such higher amount as is prescribed, by the number of the dependants of the person on the last day of the period; or

      * (b) in relation to a person who had no dependants on the last day of the period--the amount worked out by multiplying by 8, or such other number as is prescribed, an amount equal to 60%, or such other percentage as is prescribed, of the aggregate of the amount worked out under subparagraph (a)(i) and the amount referred to in subparagraph (a)(ii) if paragraph (a) had applied to the person.

    * **_ascertained income_**, in relation to a period, means:

      * (a) in relation to a person who is not a member of a couple--the income of the person in respect of that period; and

      * (b) in relation to a person who is a member of a couple--the income of the person and his or her partner in respect of that period.

    * **_income_**, in relation to a person, means ordinary income and, to the extent that they are not ordinary income, includes:

      * (aa) payments of a social security pension or a social security benefit; and

      * (a) if the person is receiving a social security pension or benefit--the person's maintenance income (if any) within the meaning of the Family Assistance Act; and

      * (b) payments of a pension under the Veterans' Entitlements Act; and

      * (c) payments of a pension payable by a foreign country, being a pension that, in the opinion of the Secretary, is similar in character to a pension referred to in paragraph (b); and

      * (e) payments of compensation, including compensation within the meaning of the Military Rehabilitation and Compensation Act; and

      * (f) instalments of parental leave pay; and

      * (g) dad and partner pay.

    * 1071A5	If a weekly rate of income referred to in subparagraph (a)(i) of the definition of **_allowable income_** in point 1071A4 or an amount worked out under paragraph (b) of that definition includes an amount of cents, the amount of that weekly rate is, for the purposes of that definition, increased to the nearest whole dollar.

    * 1071A6	A couple is a **_oneincome couple_** for the purposes of point 1071A4 if only one member of the couple is receiving income.

### Part 3.10--General provisions relating to the ordinary income test

#### Division 1--Ordinary income concept

##### 1072  General meaning of ordinary income

    * A reference in this Act to a person's ordinary income for a period is a reference to the person's gross ordinary income from all sources for the period calculated without any reduction, other than a reduction under Division 1A.

##### 1073  Certain amounts taken to be received over 12 months

    * (1) Subject to point067GH5 to 1067GH20 (inclusive), 1067LD4 to 1067LD16 (inclusive), 1068G7AA to 1068G7AR (inclusive), 1068AE2 to 1068AE12 (inclusive) and 1068BD7 to 1068BD18 (inclusive), if a person receives, whether before or after the commencement of this section, an amount that:

      * (b) is not:

       * (i) income in the form of periodic payments; or

       * (ii) ordinary income from remunerative work undertaken by the person; or

       * (iii) an exempt lump sum.

    * the person is, for the purposes of this Act, taken to receive one fiftysecond of that amount as ordinary income of the person during each week in the 12 months commencing on the day on which the person becomes entitled to receive that amount.

      * (i) is subject to a seasonal work preclusion period;

    * during the period of 12 months referred to in subsection (1).

#### Division 1AAA--Work bonus

##### 1073AA  Work bonus

    * (1) This section applies to a person if:

      * (a) the person's rate of social security pension is calculated in accordance with Pension Rate Calculator A at the end of section 1064 or Pension Rate Calculator C at the end of section 1066; and

      * (b) the person has reached pension age.

         * Note: For **_pension age_** see subsections 23(5A), (5B), (5C) and (5D).

    * Employment income greater than or equal to income concession amount

    * (2) If the person's employment income for an instalment period is greater than or equal to the income concession amount for that period, then, for the purposes of Module E of that Rate Calculator, the amount of the person's employment income for that period is reduced by an amount equal to the income concession amount.

         * Example 1: David earns $2,250 of employment income in an instalment period of 14 days. David's rate of social security pension for that period is greater than nil.

         * David's employment income for that period is reduced by $250, leaving David $2,000 of employment income for that period.

         * Example 2: Amy earns $1,000 of employment income in an instalment period of 14 days. Amy's rate of social security pension for that period is greater than nil.

         * Amy's employment income for that period is reduced by $250, leaving Amy $750 of employment income for that period.

    * (3) If the person's unused concession balance (see section 1073AB) is greater than or equal to the amount (the **_current amount_**) of the person's employment income that remains after applying subsection (2) of this section in relation to an instalment period:

      * (a) for the purposes of Module E of that Rate Calculator, the person's employment income for that period is further reduced to nil; and

      * (b) if the person's rate of social security pension for that period is greater than nil--the person's unused concession balance is reduced by an amount equal to the current amount.

         * Example 1: To continue example 1 in subsection (2), assume David's unused concession balance is $2,000. The current amount is $2,000.

         * David's employment income for that period is further reduced to nil.

         * David's unused concession balance is now nil.

         * Example 2: To continue example 2 in subsection (2), assume Amy's unused concession balance is $1,600. The current amount is $750.

         * Amy's employment income for that period is further reduced to nil.

         * Amy's unused concession balance is now $850.

    * (4) If the person's unused concession balance (see section 1073AB) is greater than nil but less than the amount of the person's employment income that remains after applying subsection (2) of this section in relation to an instalment period:

      * (a) for the purposes of Module E of that Rate Calculator, the person's employment income for that period is further reduced by an amount equal to that unused concession balance; and

      * (b) if the person's rate of social security pension for that period is greater than nil--the person's unused concession balance is reduced to nil.

         * Example: Bill earns $1,250 of employment income in an instalment period of 14 days. Bill's rate of social security pension for that period is greater than nil.

         * Under subsection (2), Bill's employment income for that period is reduced by $250, leaving Bill $1,000 of employment income for that period.

         * Assume Bill's unused concession balance is $800.

         * Under subsection (4), Bill's employment income for that period is further reduced by $800 leaving Bill $200 of employment income for that period.

         * Bill's unused concession balance is now nil.

    * Employment income less than income concession amount

    * (4A) If the person has employment income for an instalment period but that income is less than the income concession amount for that period:

      * (a) for the purposes of Module E of that Rate Calculator, the person's employment income for that period is reduced to nil; and

      * (b) if the person's rate of social security pension for that period is greater than nil--the person's unused concession balance (see section 1073AB) is increased, subject to subsection 1073AB(2), by an amount equal to the difference between that income concession amount and that employment income (before it was reduced).

         * Example: Emma earns $100 of employment income in an instalment period of 14 days. Emma's rate of social security pension for that period is greater than nil.

         * Emma's employment income for that period is reduced to nil.

         * Emma's unused concession balance is increased by $150.

    * No employment income

    * (4B) If:

      * (a) the person has no employment income for an instalment period; and

      * (b) the person's rate of social security pension for that period is greater than nil;

    * the person's unused concession balance (see section 1073AB) is increased, subject to subsection 1073AB(2), by an amount equal to the income concession amount for that period.

    * Definition

    * (4C) The **_income concession amount _**is:

      * (a) for an instalment period of 14 days--$250; and

      * (b) for an instalment period of less than 14 days--the amount worked out using the following formula:

    * Interpretation

    * (5) For the purposes of this section, a person's employment income for an instalment period includes an amount that is taken to have been earned, derived or received over that period because of subsection 1073A(1).

    * (6) If the person is a member of a couple, apply this section in relation to the person, and to the person's partner, before applying point 1064E2 or point 1066E2 (whichever is relevant).

    * (7) In working out a person's employment income for the purposes of this section, disregard subsection 8(1B).

    * (8) If:

      * (a) the person is a member of a couple; and

      * (b) the person's partner's employment income (within the meaning of section 46AB of the _Veterans' Entitlements Act 1986_) is reduced by one or more amounts (each of which is a **_reduction amount_**) under section 46AA of that Act;

    * then, in applying point 1064E2 or point 1066E2 (whichever is relevant), the ordinary income of the person's partner is to be reduced by an amount equal to the total of the reduction amounts.

##### 1073AB  Unused concession balance

    * Initial unused concession balance of nil

    * (1) A person has an unused concession balance of nil on the first day that is after 30 June 2011 and is a day on which section 1073AA applies to the person.

    * Maximum unused concession balance

    * (2) If, apart from this subsection, the person's unused concession balance would exceed $6,500, that balance is instead taken to be $6,500.

         * Example: John has an unused concession balance of $6,400. John earns $50 of employment income in an instalment period of 14 days.

         * Instead of John's unused concession balance increasing to $6,600 under subsection 1073AA(4A), John's unused concession balance increases to $6,500.

    * Effect of ceasing to receive social security pension

    * (3) If the person ceases to receive the social security pension referred to in paragraph 1073AA(1)(a), the person retains the person's unused concession balance immediately before that cessation.

         * Note: If section 1073AA applies to the person again, the person's unused concession balance will be that retained balance.

#### Division 1AA--Employment income attribution rules

##### 1073F  Working out accruals and depletions of working credit for social security beneficiaries

    * This section determines, in respect of each working credit participant who is receiving a social security benefit, whether, for each day in an instalment period:

      * (a) there is an accrual to the participant's working credit balance; or

      * (b) the participant's working credit balance is unaffected; or

      * (c) the participant's working credit balance is depleted;

    * and, if there is an accrual to, or a depletion from, the participant's working credit balance, the amount of that accrual or depletion.

Method statement

       * Step 1.	Work out the amount of the participant's employment income earned, derived or received on the day. This could be a nil amount or it could be an amount that is taken, under section 1073B, to have been earned, derived or received on the day.

       * Step 2.	Multiply the amount determined under step 1 by 14. This is the participant's rate of employment income on a fortnightly basis for the day.

       * Step 3.	Add to the participant's rate of employment income on a fortnightly basis for the day the participant's rate of any other ordinary income on a fortnightly basis for the day. This is the participant's rate of total ordinary income on a fortnightly basis for the day.

       * Step 4.	If the participant's rate of total ordinary income on a fortnightly basis for the day is less than $48, there is an accrual to the participant's working credit balance for the day of an amount equal to one fourteenth of the amount by which $48 exceeds that rate. The maximum working credit balance is:

         * (a) if the participant became a working credit participant on a day under subsection 1073E(2), (3), (4), (5), (5A) or (6) and on that day the participant was receiving youth allowance, the participant was not undertaking fulltime study and the participant was not a new apprentice--$3,500; or

         * (b) in any other case--$1,000.

       * Step 5.	If the participant's rate of total ordinary income on a fortnightly basis for the day is at least $48 but does not exceed the ordinary income free area applicable to the participant for the day under the income test module of the appropriate rate calculator, the participant's working credit balance for the day is neither increased nor reduced.

       * Step 6.	If the participant's rate of total ordinary income on a fortnightly basis for the day is at least $48 and exceeds the participant's applicable ordinary income free area for the day, the participant's working credit balance, if it is greater than nil on the day, is depleted on that day by the least of:

         * (a) the amount of employment income determined under step 1; or

         * (b) one fourteenth of the amount by which the participant's rate of total ordinary income on a fortnightly basis exceeds the participant's applicable ordinary income free area; or

         * (c) the participant's available working credit balance.

##### 1073G  Working out the effect of a working credit depletion on the fortnightly rate of ordinary income for a social security beneficiary

    * If, under section 1073F, the working credit balance of a working credit participant is depleted on a particular day, the participant's rate of ordinary income on a fortnightly basis for that day is reduced by the working credit depletion amount applicable to that day, determined under step 6 of the method statement, multiplied by 14.

##### 1073H  Working out accruals and depletions of working credit for social security pensioners

    * This section determines, in respect of each working credit participant who is receiving a social security pension, whether, for each day in an instalment period:

      * (a) there is an accrual to the participant's working credit balance; or

      * (b) the participant's working credit balance is unaffected; or

      * (c) the participant's working credit balance is depleted;

    * and, if there is an accrual to, or a depletion from, the participant's working credit balance, the amount of that accrual or depletion.

Method statement

       * Step 1.	Work out the amount of the participant's employment income earned, derived or received on the day. This could be a nil amount or it could be an amount that is taken, under section 1073B, to have been earned, derived or received on the day.

       * Step 2.	Multiply the amount determined under step 1 by 364. This is the participant's rate of employment income on a yearly basis for the day.

       * Step 3.	Add to the participant's rate of employment income on a yearly basis for the day the participant's rate of any other ordinary income on a yearly basis for the day. This is the participant's rate of total ordinary income on a yearly basis for the day.

       * Step 4.	Divide the participant's rate of total ordinary income on a yearly basis for the day by 26. This is the participant's rate of total ordinary income, expressed on a fortnightly basis, for the day.

       * Step 5.	Divide the yearly ordinary income free area applicable to the participant for the day under the ordinary income test module of the appropriate rate calculator by 26. This is the participant's applicable ordinary income free area, expressed on a fortnightly basis, for the day.

       * Step 6.	If the participant's rate of total ordinary income, expressed on a fortnightly basis, for the day, is less than $48, there is an accrual to the participant's working credit balance, for the day, of an amount equal to one fourteenth of the amount by which $48 exceeds that rate. The maximum working credit balance is $1,000.

       * Step 7.	If the participant's rate of total ordinary income, expressed on a fortnightly basis, for the day, is at least $48 but does not exceed the participant's applicable ordinary income free area, expressed on a fortnightly basis for the day in accordance with step 5, the participant's working credit balance for the day is neither increased nor reduced.

       * Step 8.	If the participant's rate of total ordinary income, expressed on a fortnightly basis, for the day, is at least $48 and exceeds the participant's applicable ordinary income free area, expressed on a fortnightly basis for the day in accordance with step 5, the participant's working credit balance, if it is greater than nil on the day, is depleted on that day by the least of:

         * (a) the amount of employment income determined under step 1; or

         * (b) one fourteenth of the amount by which the participant's rate of total ordinary income, expressed on a fortnightly basis, exceeds the participant's applicable ordinary income free area, expressed on that basis; or

         * (c) the participant's available working credit balance.

##### 1073I  Working out the effect of a working credit depletion on the yearly rate of ordinary income for a social security pensioner

    * If, under section 1073H, the working credit balance of a working credit participant is depleted on a particular day, the participant's rate of ordinary income on a yearly basis for that day is reduced by the working credit depletion amount applicable to that day, determined under step 8 of the method statement, multiplied by 364.

##### 1073J  Working credit balance prevents loss of qualification in certain cases

    * (1) If:

      * (a) a person receiving disability support pension, carer payment, youth allowance, newstart allowance or sickness allowance is a working credit participant; and

      * (b) either:

       * (i) the participant commences to earn, derive or receive, or to be taken to earn, derive or receive, employment income; or

       * (ii) there is an increase in the employment income that is earned, derived or received, or taken to be earned, derived or received, by the participant; and

      * (c) the participant has a working credit balance greater than nil at the start of the instalment period of the participant in which the commencement or increase occurs; and

      * (d) but for the commencement or increase, the participant would have continued to be qualified for the payment mentioned in paragraph (a) until the earlier of:

       * (i) a day determined under Division 8 or 9 of Part 3 of the Administration Act; or

       * (ii) the day on which the participant's working credit balance is reduced to nil;

    * the participant is to be treated as if he or she had continued to be so qualified until the earlier of the days determined as referred to in subparagraphs (d)(i) and (ii).

    * (2) If:

      * (a) a woman receiving wife pension is a working credit participant; and

      * (b) the partner of the participant ceases to receive age pension or disability support pension on and from a day (the **_cessation day_**); and

      * (c) the partner ceases to receive that pension:

       * (i) because of the employment income of the partner (either alone or in combination with any other ordinary income earned, derived or received, or taken to have been earned, derived or received, by the partner); and

       * (ii) after any working credit balance of the partner is reduced to nil; and

      * (d) as a result of the partner's so ceasing to receive that pension, the participant ceases to be qualified for wife pension on and from the cessation day; and

      * (e) the participant has a working credit balance greater than nil at the start of the instalment period of the participant in which the cessation day occurs; and

      * (f) but for the employment income, or combined income, referred to in paragraph (c), the participant would have continued to be qualified for wife pension until the earlier of:

       * (i) a day determined under Division 8 or 9 of Part 3 of the Administration Act; or

       * (ii) the day on which the participant's working credit balance is reduced to nil;

    * the participant is to be treated as if she had continued to be so qualified until the earlier of the days referred to in subparagraphs (f)(i) and (ii).

##### 1134  Effect of participation in pension loans scheme--pension or allowance rate

    * (1) If:

      * (a) a person is qualified to participate in the pension loans scheme; and

      * (b) the person makes a request to participate under section 1136; and

      * (d) the Secretary is satisfied that the amount of any debt that becomes payable by the person to the Commonwealth under this Division is readily recoverable;

    * then: 

      * (e) the rate of the pension or allowance payable to the person by operation of the scheme is to be:

       * (i) the maximum payment rate; or

       * (ia) if DFISA under Part VIIAB of the Veterans' Entitlements Act is payable to the person--the maximum payment rate less the DFISA rate; or

       * (ii) some other rate nominated by the person;

      * whichever is the lowest.

         * Note: For **_maximum payment rate _**see subsection 1133AA(1).

    * (2) The pension or allowance is to commence to be paid at the rate payable by operation of the scheme in respect of the first instalment period for which an instalment is paid after the request is lodged.

##### 1135  Effect of participation in pension loans scheme--creation of debt

    * (1) If the rate of the pension or allowance payable by operation of the pension loans scheme is more than the rate that would have been received by the person but for the operation of the scheme, the person owes a debt to the Commonwealth.

    * (3) This is how to work out the amount of the debt owed by the person from time to time:

Method statement

       * Step 1.	Work out the sum of the amount of pension or allowance received by the person from time to time under the pension loans scheme: the result is the **_primary loan amount_**.

       * Step 2.	Add to the primary loan amount the amount of any registration costs payable by the person under subsection 1143(4): the result is the **_registration cost adjusted amount_**.

       * Step 3.	Take away from the registration cost adjusted amount the sum of the amount of pension or allowance (if any) that would have been received by the person but for the operation of the scheme: the result is the **_basic amount of debt_**.

       * Step 4.	Add to the basic amount of debt the amount of interest payable. The interest payable is compound interest at the rate fixed under subsection (4) and compounding fortnightly: the result is the **_total amount of debt_**.

       * Step 5.	From the total amount of debt take away any amount of the debt already paid to the Commonwealth: the result is the current amount of debt owed by the person.

    * (4) The rate at which compound interest is payable under subsection (3) is the rate fixed from time to time by the Minister by legislative instrument.

##### 1135A  Effect of participation in pension loans scheme--maximum loan available

    * (1) The maximum loan available to a person under the pension loans scheme is the amount worked out using the formula:

    * where: 

    * **_age component amount _**means the amount specified in column 2 of the Table in subsection (3), in relation to:

      * (a) if the person is not a member of a couple--the age the person turned on his or her last birthday; or

      * (b) if the person is a member of a couple--the age the younger member of the couple turned on his or her last birthday.

    * **_value of real assets _**means:

      * (a) if neither subparagraph 1133(1)(d)(ii) nor subparagraph 1133(2)(d)(ii) applied to the person when the person made his or her request to participate in the pension loans scheme--the value of the real assets (after deduction of any guaranteed amount); or

      * (b) if subparagraph 1133(1)(d)(ii) or (2)(d)(ii) applied to the person when the person made his or her request to participate in the pension loans scheme--the value of the charge referred to in paragraph 1133(3)(c).

         * Note 1: For **_real assets _**see subsection 1133AA(1).

         * Note 2: For **_guaranteed amount _**see subsection 1133AA(1).

    * (2) For the purposes of subsection (1), the following provisions have effect:

      * (a) if, but for this paragraph, the value of real assets would be an amount that exceeds $10,000 but is not a multiple of $10,000, the value is to be taken to be the next lower amount that is a multiple of $10,000;

      * (b) if, but for this paragraph, the value of real assets would be less than $10,000, the value is to be taken to be nil.

    * (3) The following is the Table referred to in subsection (1):

             * Note: For **_housing loan_** see subsection 10A(9).

       * Step 2.	Work out the notional rate of interest for the loan using subsection (2), (3) or (4).

       * Step 3.	Work out the actual rate of interest for the loan in the appropriate tax year using subsection (5).

       * Step 4.	Work out whether the actual rate of interest exceeds the notional rate of interest.

       * Step 5.	If the actual rate of interest is equal to or exceeds the notional rate of interest, the value of the loan fringe benefit is nil.

             * Note: If the value of the loan fringe benefit is nil, you do not have to go any further in the Method statement.

       * Step 6.	If the actual rate of interest is less than the notional rate of interest, take the actual rate of interest away from the notional rate of interest.

       * Step 7.	Work out the amount of the loan (both the principal and interest) that is outstanding in the appropriate tax year using subsection (6).

       * Step 10.	Apply the formula:

       * Step 11.	The amount obtained by applying the formula in Step 10 is the **_value of the loan fringe benefit_**.

             * Note: If the person is a member of a couple, the value of the loan fringe benefit is to be halved in certain circumstances (see subsection (7)).

    * (2) The notional rate of interest for the tax year ending 30 June 1993 is:

      * (a) 10% for a housing loan; and

##### 1157TE  Value of payments associated with enjoying housing rights--general

    * (1) This is how to work out the value of a housing fringe benefit to which subsection 1157I(5) applies that is provided to a person who is not an employee of the Defence Force:

Method statement

       * Step 1.	Work out the location of the unit of accommodation and go to the appropriate row of the Housing Fringe Benefits Value Table.

       * Step 2.	Work out the type of accommodation and go to the appropriate column in the Table: the number where the row and column intersect is the **_weekly market rent_** of the unit of accommodation.

             * Note: If the person is a member of a couple, the weekly market rent is to be halved in certain circumstances (see subsection (4)).

       * Step 3.	Work out how many complete weeks in the appropriate tax year the unit of accommodation was or will be available to the person.

       * Step 4.	Multiply the weekly market rent of the unit of accommodation and the number of weeks obtained in Step 3: the result is the **_provisional value of the housing fringe benefit_**.

       * Step 5.	Work out the allowable rent for the unit of accommodation in the appropriate tax year using subsection (3).

             * Note: If a person is a member of a couple, the allowable rent is to be halved in certain circumstances (see subsection (4)).

       * Step 6.	Work out the amount the employer paid or will pay by way of the housing fringe benefits in respect of the unit of accommodation in the appropriate tax year: the result is the **_employer subsidy_**.

       * Step 7.	Work out the amount (if any) by which the allowable rent exceeds the employer subsidy: the result is the **_employee contribution_**.

             * Note: If the employer subsidy equals or exceeds the allowable rent, the employee contribution is nil.

       * Step 8.	Take the employee contribution away from the provisional value of the housing fringe benefit: the result is the **_value of the housing fringe benefit_**.

    * (2) The following Table is to be used in working out the value of a housing fringe benefit to which subsection 1157I(5) applies that is provided to a person who is not an employee of the Defence Force:

         * Note 1: For **_unit of accommodation_**, **_metropolitan location_**, **_nonmetropolitan location_** and **_special housing location_** see section 10A.

         * Note 2: A housing fringe benefit that is received outside  is to be valued (see section 1157B).

         * Note 3: For  see subsection 23(1).

    * (3) The allowable rent is the amount of rent that the Secretary is satisfied is payable for the unit of accommodation in the appropriate tax year by:

      * (a) if the person is not a member of a couple--the person; or

      * (b) if the person is a member of a couple--the person and the person's partner.

    * (4) If:

      * (a) the person is a member of a couple; and

      * (b) the person's partner receives a housing fringe benefit in the appropriate tax year; and

      * (c) the person's and the partner's housing fringe benefits relate to the same unit of accommodation;

    * the weekly market rent obtained in Step 2 of the Method statement and the allowable rent obtained in Step 5 of the Method statement are both to be halved.

       * Step 2.	Work out how many complete weeks in the appropriate tax year the unit of accommodation was or will be available to the person.

       * Step 3.	Multiply the weekly market rent of the unit of accommodation and the number of weeks obtained in Step 2: the result is the **_provisional value of the housing fringe benefit_**.

       * Step 4.	Work out the allowable rent for the unit of accommodation in the appropriate tax year using subsection (3).

             * Note: If a person is a member of a couple, the allowable rent is to be halved in certain circumstances (see subsection (4)).

       * Step 5.	Work out the amount the employer paid or will pay by way of the housing fringe benefits in respect of the unit of accommodation in the appropriate tax year: the result is the **_employer subsidy_**.

       * Step 6.	Work out the amount (if any) by which the allowable rent exceeds the employer subsidy: the result is the employee contribution.

             * Note: If the employer subsidy equals or exceeds the allowable rent, the employee contribution is nil.

#### Division 5--Farmers' income test

##### 1185K  Does a person satisfy the farmers' income test?

    * How to work out whether the farmers' income test is satisfied

    * (1) This is how to work out whether a person who has transferred his or her qualifying interest in a farm or farms satisfies the farmers' income test for the purposes of this Part:

Method statement

       * Step 1.	Work out under subsection (2) the amount of the person's ordinary income (other than ordinary income from farming) for each of the last 3 financial years before the applicable completion day (the **_income test years_**).

       * If the person was a member of a couple on the applicable completion day, work out also under subsection (2) the amount of his or her partner's ordinary income (other than ordinary income from farming) for the 3 income test years.

       * Add up all the amounts so obtained. The result is called the person's **_total nonfarm income_**.

       * Step 2.	Work out under subsection (3) the amount of the person's ordinary income from farming for each of the 3 income test years.

       * If the person was a member of a couple on the applicable completion day, work out also under subsection (3) the amount of his or her partner's ordinary income from farming for the 3 income test years.

       * Add up all the amounts of positive income for both the person and the person's partner and deduct from that total the amounts of negative income (if any) for both the person and the person's partner. The result is called the person's **_total farm income_** (which may be either positive or negative).

       * Step 3.	Work out the person's **_total income for the 3 income test years_**:

         * (a) if the person's total farm income is a positive amount--by adding that amount to the amount of the person's total nonfarm income; or

         * (b) if the person's total farm income is a negative amount--by deducting that amount from the amount of the person's total nonfarm income.

       * Step 4.	Work out under subsection (4) the maximum basic rate for age pension applicable to the person. Multiply that rate by 3. The result is called the person's **_maximum basic entitlement_**.

       * Step 5.	If the person's total income for the 3 income test years is less than the person's maximum basic entitlement, the person satisfies the farmers' income test for the purposes of this Part.

       * If the person's total income for the 3 income test years equals or exceeds the person's maximum basic entitlement, the person does not satisfy the farmers' income test for the purposes of this Part.

    * Person's ordinary income from all sources other than farming

    * (2) For the purpose of working out a person's ordinary income from all sources other than farming during a financial year, the following provisions have effect:

      * (a) the provisions of Part 3.10 other than Division 1B apply to the person and so apply as if any reference in Division 1A to a tax year were a reference to that financial year;

      * (b) any return on a financial asset that the person has actually received during the financial year is taken to be ordinary income of the person.

    * Person's ordinary income from farming

    * (3) For the purpose of working out a person's ordinary income from farming during a financial year, the following provisions have effect:

      * (a) the provisions of Part 3.10 other than Division 1B apply to the person and so apply as if:

       * (i) any reference in subsection 1074(1) to a tax year were a reference to that financial year; and

       * (ii) subsection 1074(2) and section 1075 were omitted;

      * (b) any return on a financial asset that the person has actually received during the financial year and that relates to a farm or a relevant farm asset is taken to be ordinary income of the person from farming;

      * (c) if, at the end of the financial year, the value of all trading stock on hand that relates to a farm is less than the value of all such trading stock on hand at the beginning of that financial year--the amount of the difference is to be deducted from that part of the person's ordinary income from farming for that financial year that is income in the form of profits;

      * (d) there is also to be deducted from the person's ordinary income from farming:

       * (i) losses and outgoings that relate to a farm and are allowable deductions for the purposes of section 81 of the _Income Tax Assessment Act 1997_; and

       * (ii) amounts that relate to a relevant farm asset and can be deducted in respect of plant (within the meaning of the _Income Tax Assessment Act 1997_) under Division 40 of that Act; and

       * (iii) amounts that relate to a farm or a relevant farm asset and are allowable deductions under subsection 82AAC(1) of the _Income Tax Assessment Act 1936_;

      * (e) if a negative result is obtained after applying paragraphs (c) and (d)--the person's ordinary income from farming for the financial year is a negative income;

      * (f) if paragraph (e) does not apply--the person's ordinary income from farming for the financial year is a positive income.

    * Person's maximum basic rate for age pension

    * (4) For the purposes of Step 4 in the Method statement in subsection (1), the maximum basic rate for age pension applicable to the person is:

      * (a) if the person was a member of a couple at any time during the 3 years immediately before the operative day--an amount equal to twice the sum of:

       * (i) the amount that was, on the operative day, the maximum basic rate for a partnered person under Module B of Pension Rate Calculator A in section 1064; and

       * (ii) the amount that was, on the operative day, the person's pension supplement worked out under Pension Rate Calculator A; or

      * (b) if paragraph (a) does not apply--an amount equal to the sum of:

       * (i) the amount that was, on the operative day, the maximum basic rate for a person who is not a member of a couple under Module B of Pension Rate Calculator A in section 1064; and

       * (ii) the amount that was, on the operative day, the person's pension supplement worked out under Pension Rate Calculator A.

    * Meaning of **total net value**

    * **	(1)	For the purposes of subsections 1185R(1) and (2), the **_total net value_** of a sugarcane farm, or sugarcane farms, and relevant sugarcane farm assets, the eligible interests in which have been transferred, is to be calculated as follows:

    * where: 

    * **_market value of sugarcane farm assets_** means the total of the market values of the sugarcane farm, or sugarcane farms, and relevant sugarcane farm assets immediately before the transfer of the eligible interests.

    * **_sugarcane farm debts_** means the total of any amounts of money that:

      * (a) had been borrowed for the purposes of undertaking one or more sugarcane farm enterprises on the sugarcane farm or sugarcane farms; and

      * (b) had not been repaid before the transfer of the eligible interests.

         * Note: The total net value of a sugarcane farm, or sugarcane farms, and relevant sugarcane farm assets is not affected by the number of persons who have interests in them.

    * (2) Subsection (1) has effect subject to subsections (3), (4) and (5).

    * Value of farm reduced by value of transferee's interest

    * (3) If:

      * (a) a person transfers eligible interests that the person has in a sugarcane farm, or sugarcane farms, and relevant sugarcane farm assets; and

      * (b) immediately before the transfer by the person of his or her eligible interests in the farm, or farms, and relevant farm assets, the transferee had an eligible interest in the farm, or one of those farms, or a relevant farm asset;

    * then, the **_total net value_** of the farm, or farms, and relevant farm assets is the amount worked out under subsection (1) reduced by the value of the transferee's eligible interest in the farm or relevant farm asset at that time.

    * Value of farm affected by previous transaction

    * (4) If:

      * (a) a person transfers his or her eligible interests in a sugarcane farm, or sugarcane farms, and relevant sugarcane farm assets; and

      * (b) at any time after 29 April 2004 the person making the transfer entered into a transaction or transactions; and

      * (c) the result of the transaction or transactions was that the total net value (worked out in accordance with subsection (1)) of the farm, or farms, and relevant farm assets immediately before the transfer is less than the total net value that that farm, or those farms, and relevant farm assets would have had immediately before the transfer if the person had not entered into the transaction or transactions (the **_unreduced value_**);

    * then, the **_total net value_** of the farm, or farms, and relevant farm assets is taken to be an amount equal to the unreduced value.

    * Life interest retained in principal home on farm

    * (5) If:

      * (a) a person transfers eligible interests that the person has in a farm by way of gift; and

      * (b) the person retains a freehold estate, a leasehold interest or a life interest in the dwellinghouse on the farm, and any adjacent area of land used primarily for private or domestic purposes in association with that dwellinghouse, that constitute the person's principal home;

    * then: 

      * (c) for the purposes of subsections 1185R(1) and (2), the person is taken to have transferred the whole of his or her eligible interest in the farm by way of gift; and

      * (d) in assessing the market value of the farm for the purposes of subsection (1), the value of the dwellinghouse and any adjacent area of land used primarily for private or domestic purposes in association with that dwellinghouse is not to be included.

         * Note: For **_eligible interest, relevant sugarcane farm asset_**, **_sugarcane farm_** and **_transfer _**see subsection 17B(1).

#### Division 2--Modification of provisions relating to assets test

#### Division 4--Sugarcane farmers' income test

##### 1185Y  Does a person satisfy the sugarcane farmers' income test?

    * How to work out whether the sugarcane farmers' income test is satisfied

    * (1) This is how to work out whether a person who has transferred his or her eligible interest in a sugarcane farm or sugarcane farms satisfies the sugarcane farmers' income test for the purposes of this Part:

Method statement

       * Step 1.	Work out under subsection (2) the amount of the person's ordinary income (other than ordinary income from farming) for each of the last 3 financial years before the applicable completion day (the **_income test years_**).

       * If the person was a member of a couple on the applicable completion day, work out also under subsection (2) the amount of his or her partner's ordinary income (other than ordinary income from farming) for the 3 income test years.

       * Add up all the amounts so obtained. The result is called the person's **_total nonfarm income_**.

       * Step 2.	Work out under subsection (3) the amount of the person's ordinary income from farming for each of the 3 income test years.

       * If the person was a member of a couple on the applicable completion day, work out also under subsection (3) the amount of his or her partner's ordinary income from farming for the 3 income test years.

       * Add up all the amounts of positive income for both the person and the person's partner and deduct from that total the amounts of negative income (if any) for both the person and the person's partner. The result is called the person's **_total farm income_** (which may be either positive or negative).

       * Step 3.	Work out the person's **_total income for the 3 income test years_**:

         * (a) if the person's total farm income is a positive amount--by adding that amount to the amount of the person's total nonfarm income; or

         * (b) if the person's total farm income is a negative amount--by deducting that amount from the amount of the person's total nonfarm income.

       * Step 4.	Work out under subsection (4) the maximum basic rate for age pension applicable to the person. Multiply that rate by 3. The result is called the person's **_maximum basic entitlement_**.

       * Step 5.	If the person's total income for the 3 income test years is less than the person's maximum basic entitlement, the person satisfies the sugarcane farmers' income test for the purposes of this Part.

       * If the person's total income for the 3 income test years equals or exceeds the person's maximum basic entitlement, the person does not satisfy the sugarcane farmers' income test for the purposes of this Part.

    * Person's ordinary income from all sources other than farming

    * (2) For the purpose of working out a person's ordinary income from all sources other than farming during a financial year, the following provisions have effect:

      * (a) the provisions of Part 3.10 other than Division 1B apply to the person and so apply as if any reference in Division 1A to a tax year were a reference to that financial year;

      * (b) any return on a financial asset that the person has actually received during the financial year is taken to be ordinary income of the person.

    * Person's ordinary income from farming

    * (3) For the purpose of working out a person's ordinary income from farming during a financial year, the following provisions have effect:

      * (a) the provisions of Part 3.10 other than Division 1B apply to the person and so apply as if:

       * (i) any reference in subsection 1074(1) to a tax year were a reference to that financial year; and

       * (ii) subsection 1074(2) and section 1075 were omitted;

      * (b) any return on a financial asset that the person has actually received during the financial year and that relates to a farm or a relevant farm asset is taken to be ordinary income of the person from farming;

      * (c) if, at the end of the financial year, the value of all trading stock on hand that relates to a farm is less than the value of all such trading stock on hand at the beginning of that financial year--the amount of the difference is to be deducted from that part of the person's ordinary income from farming for that financial year that is income in the form of profits;

      * (d) there is also to be deducted from the person's ordinary income from farming:

       * (i) losses and outgoings that relate to a business of primary production and are allowable deductions under section 81 of the _Income Tax Assessment Act 1997_; and

       * (ii) deductions for the cost of depreciating assets that are used in a business of primary production and are allowable deductions under Subdivisions 40A to 40E (inclusive), or Division 328, of the _Income Tax Assessment Act 1997_; and

       * (iii) contributions that are allowable deductions under section 29060 of the _Income Tax Assessment Act 1997_;

      * (e) if a negative result is obtained after applying paragraphs (c) and (d)--the person's ordinary income from farming for the financial year is a negative income;

      * (f) if paragraph (e) does not apply--the person's ordinary income from farming for the financial year is a positive income.

    * Person's maximum basic rate for age pension

    * (4) For the purposes of Step 4 in the Method statement in subsection (1), the maximum basic rate for age pension applicable to the person is:

      * (a) if the person was a member of a couple at any time during the 3 years immediately before the applicable completion day--an amount equal to twice the sum of:

       * (i) the amount that was, on the applicable completion day, the maximum basic rate for a partnered person under Module B of Pension Rate Calculator A in section 1064; and

       * (ii) the amount that was, on the applicable completion day, the person's pension supplement worked out under Pension Rate Calculator A; or

      * (b) if paragraph (a) does not apply--an amount equal to the sum of:

       * (i) the amount that was, on the applicable completion day, the maximum basic rate for a person who is not a member of a couple under Module B of Pension Rate Calculator A in section 1064; and

       * (ii) the amount that was, on the applicable completion day, the person's pension supplement worked out under Pension Rate Calculator A.

    * Definitions

    * (5) In this section:

    * **_applicable completion day_**, in relation to a transfer, means the earlier of:

      * (a) the day on which the transfer was completed; and

      * (b) the RASF closing day.

    * **_income_**, in relation to a person, has the same meaning as in subsection 8(1), except that, in addition to any amount that is not income of the person because of subsection 8(4), (5), (7A) or (8), any payment to the person under the Veterans' Entitlements Act is not income of the person for the purposes of this section.

    * **_ordinary income from farming_**, in relation to a person who has an eligible interest in a sugarcane farm or sugarcane farms, means the ordinary income of the person from:

      * (a) the sugarcane farm, or sugarcane farms, and any relevant sugarcane farm assets; and

      * (b) any other farm, or farms, or relevant farm assets in which the person has an interest.

#### Division 2--CPI indexation

##### 1191  CPI Indexation Table

    * (1) Subject to subsection (1A), an amount referred to in the following CPI Indexation Table below is to be indexed under this Division on each indexation day for the amount, using the reference quarter and base quarter for the amount and indexation day and rounding off to the nearest multiple of the rounding amount:

    * (1A) The pension MBR amount (item 1 of table) and the benefit MBR (ordinary) amount (item 2 of table) are not to be indexed on 20 March 1993.

    * Highest quarter

    * (2) A reference in the CPI Indexation Table to the highest of a group of quarters is a reference to the quarter in that group that has the highest index number.

##### 1192  Indexation of amounts

    * (1) If an amount is to be indexed under this Division on an indexation day, this Act has effect as if the indexed amount were substituted for that amount on that day.

    * (2) This is how to work out the indexed amount for an amount that is to be indexed under this Division on an indexation day:

Method statement

       * Step 1.	Use section 1193 to work out the indexation factor for the amount on the indexation day.

       * Step 2.	Work out the current figure for the amount immediately before the indexation day.

       * Step 3.	Multiply the current figure by the indexation factor: the result is the **_provisional indexed amount_**.

       * Step 4.	Use section 1194 to round off the provisional indexed amount: subject to Division 3, the result is the indexed amount. (The indexed amount (including one replaced under Division 3) may be increased under section 1195 in certain cases.)

         * Note 1: For **_current figure_** see subsection 20(1).

         * Note 2: On the indexation days following 19 March 2001, the indexation of amounts that were increased by 4% or 10% on 1 July 2000 may be affected by section 1206GB.

    * (1) This section applies to the amount (the **_starting amount_**) referred to in column 2 of item 1 of the table in subsection 1191(1), except to the extent that it covers the maximum basic rate for pension PP (single).

    * (2) If the indexed amount for the starting amount, worked out under section 1192 on an indexation day and disregarding section 1195 and this Division, is less than the living cost amount worked out on that indexation day using the following method statement, then that indexed amount is taken to be an amount equal to that living cost amount:

Method statement

       * Step 1.	Use section 1197 to work out the living cost indexation factor on that indexation day.

       * Step 2.	Work out the current figure for the starting amount immediately before that indexation day.

             * Note: For **_current figure_** see subsection 20(1).

       * Step 3.	Multiply the current figure by the living cost indexation factor: the result is the **_provisional living cost amount_**.

       * Step 4.	Use section 1198 to round off the provisional living cost amount: the result is the **_living cost amount_**.

         * Note 1: If the indexed amount for the starting amount, worked out under section 1192, is taken to be an amount equal to that living cost amount, there may be a further increase of that replaced indexed amount under section 1195.

         * Note 2: On and after 20 March 2013, the indexation of certain amounts may be affected by Division 8.

##### 1197  Living cost indexation factor

    * (1) Subject to subsections (5) and (6), the living cost indexation factor on an indexation day is:

    * worked out to 3 decimal places.

    * (3) For the purposes of this section, the **_reference quarter_** is:

      * (a) if the indexation day is a 20 March--the most recent December quarter before the indexation day; and

      * (b) if the indexation day is a 20 September--the most recent June quarter before the indexation day.

    * (4) For the purposes of this section, the **_base quarter_** is the June or December quarter that:

      * (a) is a quarter before the reference quarter; and

      * (b) has the highest living cost index number.

    * Rounding

    * (5) If a living cost indexation factor worked out under subsection (1) would, if it were worked out to 4 decimal places, end in a number that is greater than 4, that indexation factor is to be increased by 0.001.

    * (6) If a living cost indexation factor worked out under subsections (1) and (5) would be less than 1, that indexation factor is to be increased to 1.

    * Publication of substituted living cost index numbers

    * (7) Subject to subsection (8), if at any time (whether before or after the commencement of this section) the Australian Statistician publishes a living cost index number for a quarter in substitution for a living cost index number previously published by the Australian Statistician for that quarter, the publication of the later living cost index number is to be disregarded for the purposes of this section.

    * Change to reference base

    * (8) If at any time (whether before or after the commencement of this section) the Australian Statistician changes the reference base for the Pensioner and Beneficiary Living Cost Index, regard is to be had, for the purposes of applying this section after the change takes place, only to living cost index numbers published in terms of the new reference base.

##### 1198  Rounding off amounts

    * (1) If a provisional living cost amount is a multiple of $2.60, the provisional living cost amount becomes the living cost amount.

    * (2) Subject to subsection (3), if a provisional living cost amount is not a multiple of $2.60, the living cost amount is the provisional living cost amount rounded up or down to the nearest multiple of $2.60.

    * (3) If a provisional living cost amount is not a multiple of $2.60 but is a multiple of $1.30, the living cost amount is the provisional living cost amount rounded up to the nearest multiple of $2.60.

#### Division 4--Adjustment of other rates

##### 1198A  Adjustment of single pension rate MBR amounts

    * (2) For the purposes of this section, the adjusted single pension amount is worked out as follows:

Method statement

       * Step 1.	Work out the amount substituted for the amount specified in column 3 of item 2 of Table B in point 1064B1 on that indexation day under section 1192.

       * Step 2.	Multiply the amount worked out at step 1 by 2.

       * Step 3.	Work out 66.33% of the amount worked out at step 2.

       * Step 4.	Round the amount worked out at step 3 to the nearest multiple of $2.60 (rounding up if necessary): the result is the **_adjusted single pension amount_**.

      * (b) rounding off the provisional replacement amount in accordance with section 1206GD, using the rounding base for the base amount (see column 3 of Table A).

##### 1206GB  Adjustment of amounts following 1 July 2000 increase

    * (1) If an amount (the **_affected amount_**) is:

      * (a) an amount described in the table in section 1206GA or in the table in section 1206GAA that is indexed under Division 2 of this Part; or

      * (b) a maximum basic rate provided for in point 1064B1, 1065B1, 1066B1 or 1068AB1; or

      * (c) a pension supplement provided for in point 1064BA2, 1065BA2, 1066BA2 or 1068ABA2;

    * this section applies to modify the way the amount is indexed under Division 2 of this Part for a limited period after 19 March 2001.

Method statement

       * Step 1.	Work out the current figure for the affected amount on 19 March 2001.

       * Step 2.	Multiply the current figure by 0.02. The result is the **_provisional overall adjustment amount_**.

       * Step 3.	Round off the provisional overall adjustment amount in accordance with subsections (3) to (5), using:

         * (a) for an affected amount described in the table in section 1206GA or in the table in section 1206GAA--the rounding base set out in that table for that amount; and

         * (b) for a maximum basic rate provided for in point 1064B1, 1065B1, 1066B1 or 1068AB1--the rounding base of $2.60; and

         * (c) for a pension supplement provided for in point 1064BA2, 1065BA2, 1066BA2 or 1068ABA2--the rounding base of $0.10.

       * The result is the **_overall adjustment amount_**.

       * Step 4.	For the first indexation day for an affected amount that occurs after 19 March 2001, subtract the current figure from the indexed amount (arrived at using the method statement in subsection 1192(2)). The result (which could be zero) is the **_first indexation increase amount_**.

       * Step 5.	Compare the overall adjustment amount with the first indexation increase amount. If the overall adjustment amount is equal to or less than the first indexation increase amount, go to step 6. If the overall adjustment amount is greater than the first indexation increase amount, go to Step 9.

       * Step 6.	Subtract the overall adjustment amount from the indexed amount referred to in Step 4.

       * Step 7.	If the indexed amount is a pension supplement, round off the result in accordance with subsections (3) to (5) (as if the amount were a provisional overall adjustment amount), using the rounding base of $2.60.

       * Step 8.	The result obtained under step 6 or step 7 (as the case requires) is taken to be the indexed amount for the purposes of step 4 of the method statement in subsection 1192(2) and this section has no further application in relation to the affected amount.

             * Note: The indexed amount for the purposes of step 4 of the method statement in subsection 1192(2) may be increased under section 1195 in certain cases.

       * Step 9.	The indexed amount for the purposes of step 4 of the method statement in subsection 1192(2) is taken to be equal to the current figure worked out under step 2 of the method statement in subsection 1192(2). Go to step 10.

             * Note: The indexed amount for the purposes of step 4 of the method statement in subsection 1192(2) may be increased under section 1195 in certain cases.

       * Step 10.	For the second indexation day for the affected amount that occurs after 19 March 2001, subtract the first indexation increase amount from the overall adjustment amount. The result is the **_remaining adjustment amount_**.

       * Step 11.	Subtract the current figure from the indexed amount (arrived at using the method statement in subsection 1192(2)). The result (which could be zero) is the **_second indexation increase amount_**.

       * Step 12.	Compare the remaining adjustment amount with the second indexation increase amount. If the remaining adjustment amount is equal to or less than the second indexation increase amount, go to step 13. If the remaining adjustment amount is greater than the second indexation increase amount, go to step 16.

       * Step 13.	Subtract the remaining adjustment amount from the indexed amount.

       * Step 14.	If the indexed amount is a pension supplement, round off the result in accordance with subsections (3) to (5) (as if the amount were a provisional overall adjustment amount), using the rounding base of $2.60.

       * Step 15.	The result obtained under step 13 or step 14 (as the case requires) is taken to be the indexed amount for the purposes of step 4 of the method statement in subsection 1192(2) and this section has no further application in relation to the affected amount.

             * Note: The indexed amount for the purposes of step 4 of the method statement in subsection 1192(2) may be increased under section 1195 in certain cases.

       * Step 16.	The indexed amount for the purposes of step 4 of the method statement in subsection 1192(2) is taken to be equal to the current figure worked out under step 2 of the method statement in subsection 1192(2). Go to step 17.

             * Note: The indexed amount for the purposes of step 4 of the method statement in subsection 1192(2) may be increased under section 1195 in certain cases.

       * Step 17.	Repeat the method set out in step0 to 16 in relation to the third indexation day and to subsequent indexation days until the remaining adjustment amount is zero.

    * Application of section 1195 to affected amounts

    * (2) Section 1195 does not apply at Step 4 or Step 11 of the Method statement in this section.

    * Rounding of provisional overall adjustment amounts

    * (3) If a provisional overall adjustment amount is a multiple of the rounding base, the provisional overall adjustment amount is the overall adjustment amount.

    * (4) If a provisional overall adjustment amount is not a multiple of the rounding base, the overall adjustment amount is the provisional overall adjustment amount rounded up or down to the nearest multiple of the rounding base.

    * (5) If a provisional overall adjustment amount is not a multiple of the rounding base, but is a multiple of half the rounding base, the overall adjustment amount is the provisional overall adjustment amount rounded up to the nearest multiple of the rounding base.

#### Division 8--Adjustments relating to clean energy household assistance

##### 1206GF  Special rules for indexation of certain rates on or after 20 March 2013

    * (1) The indexation factor for an amount set out in subsection (2) on an indexation day on or after 20 March 2013 is to be reduced by the brought forward CPI indexation amount, but not below 1.

         * Note: Once the brought forward CPI indexation amount becomes 0, there will be no further reduction of the factor.

         * Example: Assume that the indexation factor worked out under section 1193 on 20 March 2013 is 1.003. The brought forward CPI indexation amount in relation to 20 March 2013 is 0.007 (as there has been no previous reduction). That indexation factor is reduced to 1 on 20 March 2013.

         * Further assume that on 20 September 2013 the indexation factor is 1.010. The brought forward CPI indexation amount in relation to 20 September 2013 is 0.004. That indexation factor is reduced to 1.006 on 20 September 2013.

         * The brought forward CPI indexation amount in relation to later indexation days is now 0 so there is no further reduction of the indexation factor.

    * (2) For the purposes of subsection (1), the amounts are as follows:

      * (a) pension MBR;

      * (b) PS rate;

      * (c) PS minimum rate;

      * (d) PS basic rate;

      * (e) benefit MBR (ordinary);

      * (f) pension supplement component for pension bonus;

      * (g) maximum transitional pension rates.

    * (3) The living cost indexation factor worked out under section 1197:

      * (a) for pension MBR, except to the extent that pension MBR covers the maximum basic rate for pension PP (single); and

      * (b) for each indexation day on or after 20 March 2013;

    * is to be reduced by the brought forward PBLCI indexation amount, but not below 1.

         * Note: Once the brought forward PBLCI indexation amount becomes 0, there will be no further reduction of the factor.

         * Example: Assume that the living cost indexation factor worked out under section 1197 on 20 March 2013 is 1.003. The brought forward PBLCI indexation amount in relation to 20 March 2013 is 0.007 (as there has been no previous reduction). That indexation factor is reduced to 1 on 20 March 2013.

         * Further assume that on 20 September 2013 the living cost indexation factor is 1.010. The brought forward PBLCI indexation amount in relation to 20 September 2013 is 0.004. That indexation factor is reduced to 1.006 on 20 September 2013.

         * The brought forward PBLCI indexation amount in relation to later indexation days is now 0 so there is no further reduction of the living cost indexation factor.

    * (4) Neither paragraph (2)(a), nor subsection (3), affect:

      * (a) the rate of a payment worked out under clause 146 of Schedule 1A; or

      * (b) an amount worked out in relation to a pension because of clause 149 of that Schedule.

    * (5) In this section:

    * **_brought forward CPI indexation amount_**, in relation to a day, means:

      * (a) if subsection (3) applies for the amount, and the brought forward PBLCI indexation amount in relation to the day is 0--0; and

      * (b) otherwise--0.007 less any reduction made under subsection (1) for a previous day.

    * **_brought forward PBLCI indexation amount_**, in relation to a day, means:

      * (a) if the brought forward CPI indexation amount in relation to the day is 0--0; and

      * (b) otherwise--0.007 less any reduction made under subsection (3) for a previous day.

##### 1206GG  Special rules for indexation of certain rates on or after 1 January 2014

    * (1) The indexation factor for AP MBR or YA MBR on an indexation day on or after 1 January 2014 is to be reduced by the brought forward indexation amount, but not below 1.

    * (2) In this section:

    * **_brought forward indexation amount_**, in relation to a day, means 0.007 less any reduction made under this section for a previous day.

         * Note: Once the brought forward indexation amount becomes 0, there will be no further reduction of the factor.

         * Example: Assume that the indexation factor worked out under section 1193 on 1 January 2014 is 1.003. The brought forward indexation amount in relation to 1 January 2014 is 0.007 (as there has been no previous reduction). That indexation factor is reduced to 1 on 1 January 2014.

         * Further assume that on 1 January 2015 the indexation factor is 1.010. The brought forward indexation amount in relation to 1 January 2015 is 0.004. That indexation factor is reduced to 1.006 on 1 January 2015.

         * The brought forward indexation amount in relation to later indexation days is now 0 so there is no further reduction of the indexation factor.

##### 1206H  Advance payment deduction

    * (1) Subject to subsection (2) and section 1206L, an advance payment deduction is to be made from the rate of a social security entitlement that is payable to a person if:

      * (a) the person has received an advance payment, or an instalment of an advance payment, of that social security entitlement or of another social security entitlement that was previously payable to the person; and

      * (b) the person has not yet repaid the whole of the advance payment or instalment; and

      * (c) the amount of the advance payment or instalment that has not been repaid is not a debt under subsection 1224E(1).

         * Note: For **_social security entitlement _**see subsection 23(1).

    * (2) An advance payment deduction is not to be made from a person's rate on:

      * (a) the payday on which the advance payment is paid; or

      * (b) the payday on which the first instalment of the advance payment is paid;

    * as the case requires.

##### 1206J  Amount of advance payment deduction--basic calculation

    * Subject to sections 1206K, 1206L, 1206M and 1206N, the advance payment deduction for an advance payment of a social security entitlement is worked out by dividing the full amount of the advance payment by 13.

##### 1206K  Person may request larger advance payment deduction

    * (1) Subject to subsection (2) and sections 1206L, 1206M and 1206N, a person's advance payment deduction is increased to a larger amount if the person asks the Secretary in writing for the advance payment deduction to be the larger amount.

    * (2) Subsection (1) does not apply if the Secretary is satisfied that the person would suffer severe financial hardship if the advance payment deduction were the larger amount.

##### 1206L  Reduction of advance payment deduction in cases of severe financial hardship

    * Reduction

    * (1) Subject to subsection (2) and sections 1206M and 1206N, if:

      * (a) the person applies in writing to the Secretary for an advance payment deduction to be decreased, or to be stopped, because of severe financial hardship; and

      * (b) the Secretary is satisfied that:

       * (i) the person's circumstances are exceptional and could not reasonably have been foreseen at the time of the person's application for the advance payment; and

       * (ii) the person would suffer severe financial hardship if the advance payment deduction that would otherwise apply were to continue;

    * the Secretary may determine in writing that, for the period specified in the determination, the advance payment deduction is to be a lesser amount (which may be a nil amount) specified in the determination.

    * Review of reduction

    * (2) At any time while the determination is in force, the Secretary may:

      * (a) vary the determination so as to require to be deducted from the person's rate an advance payment deduction larger than the deduction (if any) previously applying under the determination, but smaller than the deduction applying immediately prior to the determination; or

      * (b) revoke the determination;

    * but only if the Secretary is satisfied that the person would not suffer severe financial hardship because of the variation or revocation.

    * Variation or revocation in writing

    * (3) A variation or revocation of a determination must be in writing.

##### 1206M  The final advance payment deduction

    * Final advance payment deduction not to exceed unpaid amount

    * (1) If an advance payment deduction that would otherwise be deducted from a person's rate exceeds the part of the advance payment that the person has not yet repaid (by previous deductions under this Part or otherwise), the amount of that advance payment deduction equals the part that the person has not yet repaid.

         * _Example:	_

          * Facts: _Assume that, in the example at the end of section 1206J, Anne has requested that the advance payment deduction be the larger amount of $55 (see section 1206K), so that the advance payment of $450 will be repaid sooner.

          * _Application:	_If $55 is deducted from Anne's fortnightly rate of benefit, $440 will have been repaid after 8 successive fortnights, leaving $10 unpaid. Under section 1206M, the final advance payment deduction will be $10.

    * This section subject to section 1206N

    * (2) This section has effect subject to section 1206N.

##### 1206N  Provisional payment rate insufficient to cover advance payment deduction

    * (1) If the provisional payment rate referred to in the relevant Rate Calculator is less than the advance payment deduction would be apart from this subsection, the advance payment deduction is taken to be equal to the provisional payment rate.

    * (2) If:

      * (a) a person's rate of pension is the notional income/assets tested rate referred to in the Method statement in point 1065A1 in Pension Rate Calculator B; and

      * (b) the provisional payment rate worked out for the person using Pension Rate Calculator A in accordance with Step 1 of the Method statement in point 1065A1 in Pension Rate Calculator B is less than the advance payment deduction would be apart from this subsection;

    * the advance payment deduction is taken to be equal to the provisional payment rate referred to in paragraph (b).

    * (3) If:

      * (a) a person's rate of pension is the nonincome/assets tested rate referred to in the Method statement in point 1065A1 in Pension Rate Calculator B; and

    * the advance payment deduction is taken to be equal to the maximum payment rate referred to in paragraph (b).

    * (4) If:

      * (a) a person's rate of pension is the notional income/assets tested rate referred to in the Method statement in point 1066BA1 in Pension Rate Calculator E; and

      * (b) the provisional payment rate worked out for the person using Pension Rate Calculator D in accordance with Step 1 of the Method statement in point 1066BA1 in Pension Rate Calculator E is less than the advance payment deduction would be apart from this subsection;

       * Step 2.	Use the person's residence period to work out the person's **_residence factor_** using Module C below.

       * Step 3.	Work out the rate that would be the person's pension or allowance rate if this Rate Calculator did not apply to the person: the result is called the person's **_notional domestic rate_**.

       * Step 4.	Multiply the person's notional domestic rate by the person's residence factor: the result is the person's portability rate.

    * Limit in portability rate

    * 1221A2	If a person's portability rate as calculated under point 1221A1 would exceed the rate (the **_notional rate_**) that would be the person's notional domestic rate under that point if the person had a residence factor of 1, the person's portability rate is the rate that equals the notional rate.

##### Module B--Australian working life residence

    * Working life

    * 1221B1	For the purposes of this Module, a person's working life is the period beginning when the person turn6 and ending when the person reaches pension age.

         * Note: For **_pension age_** see subsections 23(5A), (5B), (5C) and (5D).

    * Australian working life residence (general)

    * 1221B2	Subject to point221B3 and 1221B4, a person's **_period of Australian working life residence_** as at a particular time is the number of months in the period, or the aggregate of the periods, during the person's working life during which the person has, up to that time, been an Australian resident.

         * Note: For the method of calculating the number of months in the period see point221B3 and 1221B4 below.

    * Calculation of number of months

    * 1221B3	If a person's period of Australian working life residence would, apart from this point, be a number of whole months, the period is to be increased by one month.

    * 1221B4	If a person's period of Australian working life residence would, apart from this point, be a number of whole months and a day or days, the period is to be increased so that it is equal to the number of months plus one month.

##### Module C--Residence factor

    * Residence factor (period of Australian working life residence 35 years or more)

    * 1221C1	If a person's period of Australian working life residence is 420 months (35 years) or more, the person's residence factor i.

         * Note: If a person's residence factor i, the person's pension will be payable outside  at the full domestic rate.

    * Residence factor (period of Australian working life residence under 35 years)

    * 1221C2	If a person's period of Australian working life residence is less than 420 months (35 years), the person's residence factor is:

    * whichever is the later.

    * Underestimating value of property

    * (2) If:

      * (a) a debt arose because the debtor or the debtor's partner underestimated the value of particular property of the debtor or partner; and

    * (2) Subsection (1) does not apply if the debt is at least $50 and could be recovered by deductions under section 1231 from a social security payment of the debtor.

         * Note: Section 1237AAE limits the circumstances in which an assurance of support debt may be waived under this section, and the amount of the debt that may be waived.

    * Settlement of proceedings before the AAT

    * (2) If the Secretary has agreed to settle proceedings before the AAT relating to recovery of a debt on the basis that the debtor will pay less than the full amount of the debt, the Secretary must waive the right to recover the difference between the debt and the amount that is the subject of the settlement.

    * Waiver where at least 80% of debt recovered and debtor cannot pay more

    * (3) If:

      * (a) the Commonwealth has recovered at least 80% of the original value of a debt from a debtor; and

      * (b) the Commonwealth and the debtor agree that the recovery is in full satisfaction for the whole of the debt; and

      * (c) the debtor cannot repay a greater proportion of the debt;

    * the Secretary must waive the remaining 20% or less of the value of the original debt.

    * Agreement for partpayment in satisfaction of outstanding debt

    * (4) If the Secretary and a debtor agree that the debtor's debt will be fully satisfied if the debtor pays the Commonwealth an agreed amount less than the amount of the debt outstanding at the time of the agreement (the **_unpaid amount_**), the Secretary must waive the right to recover the difference between the unpaid amount and the agreed amount.

    * Limits on agreement to accept partpayment in satisfaction of outstanding debt

    * (5) The Secretary must not make an agreement described in subsection (4) unless the Secretary is satisfied that the agreed amount is at least the present value of the unpaid amount if it is repaid in instalments of amounts, and at times, determined by the Secretary.

    * Formula for working out present value of unpaid amount

    * (6) For the purposes of subsection (5), the**_ present value of the unpaid amount _**is the amount worked out in accordance with the following formula:

    * where:

    * **_interest _**is the annual rate of interest specified by the Minister by legislative instrument.

    * **_repayment period _**is the number of years needed to repay the unpaid amount if repayments equal to the annual repayment were made each year.

         * _Example:	_

          * Facts: _	Bill owed a debt of $35,000 to the Commonwealth. After repaying $5,000 (leaving an unpaid amount of $30,000), he offers to make an immediate payment of a further $20,000 in full satisfaction of the debt. The Secretary is satisfied that Bill cannot repay a larger amount of the debt than this. The Secretary believes that $1,500 of the debt would be recovered under Part 5.3 in a year, at which rate it would take 20 years to repay the debt. The Minister has specified an interest rate of 5% a year for the purposes of subsection (6).

          * _Application:	_The Secretary can accept Bill's offer and make an agreement with him as described in subsection (4), because the $20,000 is more than the present value of $30,000 repaid over 20 years at a 5% interest rate (which is

          * If the Secretary makes the agreement, the Secretary must waive $10,000 of the debt (the difference between the unpaid amount of $30,000 and the agreed amount of $20,000).

    * (3) If the Secretary has been given a security that meets the requirements of subsection 1061ZZGD(3) in connection with the assurance, the Secretary may waive under section 1237AAA, 1237AAB or 1237AAD the right to recover an amount of the debt that is not greater than the difference (if any) between:

    * (5) If subsections (3) and (4) apply, the Secretary may waive under section 1237AAD the right to recover an amount of the debt that is not greater than the amount (if any) of the debt that may be waived taking into account both of those subsections.

##### 135  Unlimited maximum portability period for disability support pension

    * (1) The Secretary may determine that a person's maximum portability period for disability support pension is an unlimited period if:

      * (a) at the commencement of this clause, the person is absent from  and receiving disability support pension; and

      * (b) under this Act as in force immediately before the commencement, that absence could not affect the person's right to continue to be paid the disability support pension throughout the period of that absence; and

      * (c) after the commencement, the person enters  but does not become an Australian resident again.

         * Note: The condition in paragraph (1)(b) may be met:

           * (a) because the person was severely disabled (see subsection 1214(1) and item 2 of the table in subsection 1217(5) as those subsections were in force just before the commencement); or

           * (b) because clause 128 (as in force just before the commencement) applied to the person section 1213A as in force before its repeal by the _Social Security and Veterans' Entitlements Legislation Amendment (Miscellaneous Matters) Act 2000_.

    * (2) The determination has effect for the purposes of Part 4.2 of this Act as it applies in relation to an absence after the person's entry, despite the repeal and substitution of items 2 and 3 of the table in section 1217 of this Act by the _Family and Community Services and Veterans' Affairs Legislation Amendment (2003 Budget and Other Measures) Act 2003_.

##### 136  Transitional definition of deductible amount (commencing 1 July 2007)

    * (1) This clause applies if:

      * (b) the person receives income support payment in respect of a continuous period starting before, and ending on or after, the person's trigger day (see subsection (5)); and

      * (c) the amount of the income support payment received before the person's trigger day was affected by the deduction of a deductible amount (within the meaning of this Act or the Veterans' Entitlements Act, as the case requires, apart from this clause) from the amount of the payments payable to the person for a year under the income stream; and

      * (d) if the person's trigger day is after 1 July 2007--the income stream has not been partially commuted on or after 1 July 2007 and before the person's trigger day.

         * Note 1: If the income stream is wholly commuted, this clause will stop applying because the person will no longer be receiving payments from the income stream (see paragraphs (1)(a) and (d)).

         * Note 2: For the deduction of a deductible amount from amounts payable under certain defined benefit income streams, see sections 1099A and 1099D of this Act and sections 46V and 46Y of the Veterans' Entitlements Act.

    * (2) Despite the amendment of this Act by Part 2 of Schedule 8 to the _Tax Laws Amendment (Simplified Superannuation) Act 2007_, for the purposes of working out the amount of any income support payment (other than a service pension or income support supplement) received by the person on or after the trigger day in respect of the remaining part of the period mentioned in paragraph (1)(b), the **_deductible amount_**, in relation to the income stream for a year, is the greater of the following amounts:

      * (a) the deductible amount mentioned in paragraph (1)(c);

      * (b) the sum of the amounts that are the tax free components (worked out under subsections 307125(4) to (7) of the _Income Tax (Transitional Provisions) Act 1997_) of the payments received from the income stream during the year.

    * (3) However, this clause stops applying to an income stream immediately after the time (if any) that the deductible amount in relation to the income stream is, under subclause (2), the amount mentioned in paragraph (2)(b).

    * (4) For the purposes of this clause, without limiting paragraph (1)(b), if the form of a person's income support payment mentioned in paragraph (1)(b) changes during a period, the continuity of the period is not broken by the change.

         * Example: The form of a person's income support payment may change from one kind of payment (for instance, a service pension under the Veterans' Entitlements Act) to another (for instance, a social security pension under this Act).

    * (5) In this clause:

    * **_trigger day_**, for a person, means:

      * (a) if the person is under 60 years at the end of 30 June 2007--the day the person turns 60; or

      * (b) if the person is 60 years or over at the end of 30 June 2007--1 July 2007.

    * Application

    * (1) This clause applies if clause 146 affects the rate at which a social security pension is payable to a person.

    * Purpose

    * (2) The purpose of this clause is to ensure that the person is treated appropriately in relation to the payment, and income taxation, of the pension by modifying the operation of the social security law (and thus affecting the related income tax law) in relation to the person and the pension.

         * Note: This clause does not modify the operation of subsection 20A(4), which provides for working out the person's minimum pension supplement amount.

    * Pension supplement amount

    * (3) The social security law applies in relation to the person's pension as if the amount described in subparagraph 146(4)(a)(i), as affected by any indexation and any relevant reduction described in paragraph 146(4)(a), were an amount added under the pension supplement Module of the relevant Pension Rate Calculator (and therefore used to work out the rate of the pension).

         * Note 1: One effect of subclause (3) is that the amount is the person's pension supplement amount (as defined in subsection 23(1)).

         * Note 2: If that amount exceeds the person's pension supplement basic amount (as affected by subclause (4)), other effects of subclause (3) include the following:

           * (a) the excess being taxexempt pension supplement under subsection 20A(6) of this Act;

           * (b) Part 2.25C (Quarterly pension supplement) of this Act applying, which may affect timing of payment of some of the pension under the Administration Act;

           * (c) the possibility of the minimum amount of fortnightly instalments of the pension being affected under section 43 of the Administration Act;

           * (d) telephone allowance not being payable because of section 1061R of this Act;

           * (e) utilities allowance not being payable because of section 1061T of this Act.

         * Note 3: Yet another effect of subclause (3) is that section 1210 will affect the operation of reductions of the maximum payment rate because of the income test and assets test.

    * Pension supplement basic amount

    * (4) The social security law applies in relation to the person's pension as if:

      * (a) each reference in the table in subsection 20A(5) to $507 were a reference to $14,814.80; and

      * (b) the reference in the table in subsection 20A(5) to $423.80 were a reference to $12,373.40.

         * Note 1: This affects the person's pension supplement basic amount.

         * Note 2: The provisions for indexing amounts in the table in subsection 20A(5) apply to the higher figures mentioned in this subclause.

    * Energy supplement

    * (5) If subclause 147(1) or (2) is relevant to the person, the social security law applies in relation to the person's pension as if:

      * (a) the energy supplement Module of the relevant Pension Rate Calculator were the same as Module C of Pension Rate Calculator A; and

      * (b) the person's energy supplement (if any) resulting from that Module were used to work out the rate of the person's pension.

         * Note 1: This energy supplement is included in the total worked out under paragraph 146(4)(a) (see subparagraph 146(4)(a)(ia)).

         * Note 2: This subclause causes Division 2 of Part 2.18A (Quarterly energy supplement) of this Act to apply. If quarterly energy supplement is payable, then no energy supplement will be available to be included in the total worked out under paragraph 146(4)(a) (see point 1064C1 of this Act).

         * Note 3: Other effects of this subclause include:

           * (a) the possibility of the minimum amount of fortnightly instalments of the pension being affected under section 43 of the Administration Act; and

           * (b) that section 1210 will affect the operation of reductions of the maximum payment rate because of the income test and assets test.

##### 150  Persons exempt from requirement to be Australian residents to qualify for disability support pension

    * Paragraphs 94(1)(ea), 94A(1)(ja) and 95(1)(d) do not affect the qualification for disability support pension of:

      * (a) a person to whom the provisions mentioned in subclause 128(1) continue to apply as described in that subclause; or

      * (b) a person who is covered by a determination under clause 135.

         * Note: Those paragraphs are in Subdivision A of Division 1 of Part 2.3, which is about qualification for disability support pension.
