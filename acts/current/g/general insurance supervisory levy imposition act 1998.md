      * (i) unless subparagraph (ii) or (iii) applies--the amount that, for the financial year, is the special levy percentage of the general insurance company's eligible premium income; or

      * (ii) if the amount worked out under subparagraph (i) exceeds the special maximum levy amount for the financial year--the special maximum levy amount; or

      * (iii) if the amount worked out under subparagraph (i) is less than the special minimum levy amount for the financial year--the special minimum levy amount.

      * Note: The special levy percentage, the special maximum levy amount and the special minimum levy amount are as determined under subsection (3).

     * (g) the **_special levy percentage _**for each financial year; and

     * (h) how a **_general insurance company's eligible premium income _**is to be worked out.

    * (4) An amount determined under subsection (3) as the maximum restricted levy amount must not exceed the statutory upper limit as at the time when the determination is made.

    * (4A) An amount determined under subsection (3) as the special maximum levy amount must not exceed the special statutory upper limit as at the time when the determination is made.

    * (5) The Treasurer's determination under paragraph (3)(d) of how a general insurance company's levy base is to be worked out is to include, but is not limited to, a determination of the day as at which the general insurance company's levy base is to be worked out. That day must be:

     * (a) if the general insurance company was a general insurance company at all times from and including 17 March of the previous financial year to and including the following 30 June--a day in the period from and including that 17 March to and including the following 14 April; or

    * (6) The Treasurer's determination under paragraph (3)(h) of how a general insurance company's eligible premium income is to be worked out is to include, but is not limited to, a determination of:

    * (7) A determination under subsection (3) may make different provision for different classes of general insurance company.

##### 9  Calculation of indexation factor

    * (1) The indexation factor for a financial year is the number worked out by:

     * (b) adding 0.030 to the number worked out under paragraph (a).

    * (2) The indexation factor is to be calculated to 3 decimal places, but increased by .001 if the 4th decimal place is more than 4.
