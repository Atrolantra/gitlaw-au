##### 3  Object of Act

    * The object of this Act is to protect the health and safety of people, and to protect the environment, by identifying risks posed by or as a result of gene technology, and by managing those risks through regulating certain dealings with GMOs.

##### 4  Regulatory framework to achieve object

    * The object of this Act is to be achieved through a regulatory framework which: 

     * (aa) provides that where there are threats of serious or irreversible environmental damage, a lack of full scientific certainty should not be used as a reason for postponing costeffective measures to prevent environmental degradation; and

     * (a) provides an efficient and effective system for the application of gene technologies; and

     * (b) operates in conjunction with other Commonwealth and State regulatory schemes relevant to GMOs and GM products.

         * Note: Examples of the schemes mentioned in paragraph (b) are those that regulate food, agricultural and veterinary chemicals, industrial chemicals and therapeutic goods.

##### 5  Nationally consistent scheme

    * It is the intention of the Parliament that this Act form a component of a nationally consistent scheme for the regulation of certain dealings with GMOs by the Commonwealth and the States.

##### 6  Act to bind the Crown

    * (1) This Act binds the Crown in each of its capacities.

    * (2) Nothing in this Act renders the Crown liable to be prosecuted for an offence.

##### 7  

    * This Act extends to every external Territory other than .

##### 8  Offences

    * (1) Chapter 2 of the _Criminal Code_ applies to all offences against this Act.

#### Division 1--Simplified outline

##### 39  Simplified outline

    * The following is a simplified outline of this Part: 

    * This Part provides a licensing system under which a person can apply to the Regulator for a licence authorising dealings with GMOs.

    * This Part sets out the processes to be followed by the Regulator in relation to applications involving 2 kinds of dealings: 

        * (a) those that involve the intentional release of a GMO into the environment; and

        * (b) those that do not involve the intentional release of a GMO into the environment.

    * A licence can cover dealings by persons other than the licence holder. The licence holder is required to inform such persons of any conditions of the licence that apply to them.

#### Division 2--Licence applications

##### 40  Person may apply for a licence

    * (1) A person may apply to the Regulator for a licence authorising specified dealings with one or more specified GMOs by a person or persons.

    * (2) The application must be in writing, and must contain:

     * (a) such information as is prescribed by the regulations (if any); and

     * (b) such information as is specified in writing by the Regulator.

    * (3) The application must specify whether any of the dealings proposed to be authorised by the licence would involve the intentional release of a GMO into the environment.

    * (4) The dealings in respect of which a person may apply for a licence may be:

     * (a) all dealings with a GMO, or with a specified class of GMOs; or

     * (b) a specified class of dealings with a GMO, or with a specified class of GMOs; or

     * (c) one or more specified dealings with a GMO, or with a specified class of GMOs.

    * (5) The applicant may apply for a licence authorising such dealings by:

     * (a) a specified person or persons; or

     * (b) a specified class of person; or

     * (c) all persons.

    * (6) The application must be accompanied by the application fee (if any) prescribed by the regulations.

##### 40A  Licences relating to inadvertent dealings

    * (1) If the Regulator is satisfied that a person has come into possession of a GMO inadvertently the Regulator may, with the agreement of the person, treat the person as having made an inadvertent dealings application.

    * (2) To avoid doubt, subsection (1) does not prevent a person from making an application under section 40 in respect of a GMO that has inadvertently come into the person's possession.

        * Note: Sections 46A and 49 have the effect that the Regulator may expedite consideration of an application to dispose of a GMO that has come into a person's possession inadvertently. These sections have effect whether the application is made under section 40, or is taken to have been made under this section.

##### 41  Application may be withdrawn

    * (1) The applicant may withdraw the application at any time before the licence is issued.

    * (2) The application fee is not refundable if the applicant withdraws the application.

##### 42  Regulator may require applicant to give further information

    * (1) The Regulator may, by notice in writing, require an applicant for a licence to give the Regulator such further information in relation to the application as the Regulator requires.

    * (2) The notice may specify the period within which the information is to be provided.

    * (3) The Regulator may require information to be given under this section at any time before the Regulator decides the application, whether before or after the Regulator has begun to consider the application.

##### 43  Regulator must consider applications except in certain circumstances

    * (1) The Regulator must consider an application under section 40 for a licence in accordance with this Part.

    * (2) However, the Regulator is not required to consider the application, or may cease considering the application, if:

     * (a) the application does not contain the information specified by the Regulator or prescribed by the regulations; or

     * (b) the application does not satisfy subsection 40(3); or

     * (c) the application is not accompanied by the application fee (if any) prescribed by the regulations; or

     * (d) the applicant did not provide further information required by the Regulator by notice under section 42 within the period specified in the notice; or

     * (e) the Regulator is satisfied that to issue the licence would be inconsistent with a policy principle in force under section 21; or

     * (f) the Regulator is satisfied (having regard to the matters specified in section 58) that the applicant is not a suitable person to hold a licence.

    * (3) The Regulator must issue the licence, or refuse to issue the licence, within the period (if any) prescribed by the regulations.

##### 44  Regulator may consult with applicant

    * Before considering an application in accordance with the requirements of this Part, the Regulator may consult the applicant, or another regulatory agency, on any aspect of the application.

##### 45  Regulator must not use certain information in considering licence application

    * If: 

     * (a) a person (the **_first person_**) applies for a GMO licence; and

     * (b) the first person provides information to the Regulator for the purposes of the Regulator's consideration of the application; and

     * (c) the information is confidential commercial information;

    * the Regulator must not take that information into account for the purposes of considering an application by another person for a GMO licence, unless the first person has given written consent for the information to be so taken into account.

#### Division 3--Initial consideration of licences for dealings not involving intentional release of a GMO into the environment

##### 46  Applications to which this Division applies

    * Despite section 46, this Division does not apply to an application for a GMO licence if the Regulator is satisfied that:

     * (a) the dealings proposed to be authorised by the licence are limited to dealings to be undertaken for the purposes of, or for purposes relating to, disposing of a GMO; and

     * (b) the applicant for the licence came into possession of the GMO inadvertently.

##### 47  What the Regulator must do in relation to application

    * (1) Before issuing the licence, the Regulator must prepare a risk assessment and a risk management plan in relation to the dealings proposed to be authorised by the licence.
