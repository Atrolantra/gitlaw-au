     * (a) to ensure that all gaming machines are capable of supporting a venuebased voluntary precommitment scheme; and

     * (aa) to ensure that a venuebased voluntary precommitment scheme operating in a State or Territory is capable of connecting to a State or Territory wide voluntary precommitment scheme that operates within the State or Territory; and
