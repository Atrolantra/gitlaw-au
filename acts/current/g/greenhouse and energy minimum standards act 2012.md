### An Act to promote the development and adoption of products that use less energy and produce fewer greenhouse gases, and for related purposes

### Part 1--Preliminary

#### Division 1--Preliminary

##### 1  Short title

    * This Act may be cited as the _Greenhouse and Energy Minimum Standards Act 2012_.

##### 2  Commencement

    * (1) Each provision of this Act specified in column 1 of the table commences, or is taken to have commenced, in accordance with column 2 of the table. Any other statement in column 2 has effect according to its terms.

        *  	Note: This table relates only to the provisions of this Act as originally enacted. It will not be amended to deal with any later amendments of this Act.

    * (2) Any information in column 3 of the table is not part of this Act. Information may be inserted in this column, or information in it may be edited, in any published version of this Act.

#### Division 2--Guide to this Act

##### 3  Guide to this Act

Overview

    * This Act is about promoting the development and adoption of products to reduce energy use and greenhouse gas production (see the objects in Division 3 of this Part).

    * This is achieved by applying greenhouse and energy minimum standards (GEMS) in association with the supply and commercial use of products that use energy, or affect the energy used by another product. These standards are provided for by requirements in Ministerial determinations (GEMS determinations).

Key concepts (Part 2)

    * The key concepts used in this Act are unfolded in Part 2. These include GEMS products, GEMS determinations, models of GEMS products, registration of models against GEMS determinations, and supplying (or offering to supply) GEMS products.

Supply and commercial use of products (Part 3)

    * Generally speaking, a product (a GEMS product) covered by a GEMS determination can only be supplied or offered for supply, or used for a commercial purpose, if:

        * (a) the model of the product is registered under this Act against the determination; and

        * (b) the product complies with the determination; and

        * (c) the supply, offer or use complies with the determination.

    * Contravention of these rules may result in prosecution for offences or exposure to liability for civil penalties.

GEMS determinations and registration (Parts 4, 5 and 6)

    * GEMS determinations cover different product classes. They specify requirements for energy consumption, greenhouse gas production, labelling and some other matters, including the environment and human health.

    * Generally speaking, all models of GEMS products must be registered on the GEMS Register to make sure they comply with relevant GEMS determinations. A senior officer of the Department (the GEMS Regulator) is responsible for the registration system and, more broadly, the administration of this Act.

Compliance and enforcement (Parts 7 and 8)

    * Compliance with the rules about supply and commercial use can be monitored, and suspected contraventions can be investigated, by GEMS inspectors appointed under the Act. The Act sets out the circumstances in which inspections can take place, the powers of inspectors and the requirements for obtaining warrants for entry to premises without consent and, in the case of investigation warrants, for the seizure of evidential material.

    * A contravention of this Act may result in prosecution for an offence, exposure to liability for a civil penalty (under an infringement notice or a court order), suspension or cancellation of registration, the imposition of enforceable undertakings and court orders for injunctions. Details of offences, contraventions and adverse decisions, including the names of those involved, may also be publicised.

Merits review and protection of information (Parts 9 and 10)

    * Decisions about registration may be reviewed internally and by the Administrative Appeals Tribunal. The Act also protects commercially sensitive information against unauthorised disclosure.

Introductory matters (Part 1)

    * There is a Dictionary in Division 4 of this Part. The Dictionary is a list of every term that is defined in this Act. A term is either defined in the Dictionary itself, or elsewhere in this Act. If a term is defined elsewhere, the Dictionary includes a signpost.

    * The application of this Act to the Crown and in the external Territories is dealt with in Division 5 of this Part. That Division also provides for when this Act is intended to operate concurrently with State and Territory laws.

#### Division 3--Objects of this Act

##### 4  Objects of this Act

    * The objects of this Act are: 

     * (a) to give effect to certain obligations that Australia has under the Climate Change Convention; and

     * (b) to promote the development and adoption of products that:

      * (i) use less energy; or

      * (ii) produce fewer greenhouse gases; or

      * (iii) contribute to reducing the amount of energy used, or greenhouse gases produced, by other products.

### Part 2--Key concepts

#### Division 1--Guide to this Part

##### 10  Guide to this Part

    * This Part is about some of the key concepts used in this Act, and the interrelationships between those concepts.

    * This Act applies to GEMS products, which are products that use energy, or affect the amount of energy used by another product, and belong to a product class for which a GEMS determination has been made (under Part 4).

    * GEMS products may be determined to be category A products or category B products. Category B products have a higher impact on energy use or greenhouse gas production than category A products. Different penalty levels apply to contraventions of the main rules about supply and use of GEMS products in Part 3, depending on the category of the product.

    * GEMS products belong to a particular model if they have the same technical specifications, brand name (or manufacturer) and a unique identifier. Generally speaking, all models of GEMS products must be registered under Part 5 (in the GEMS Register) against GEMS determinations.

    * A model's registration may be affected by a replacement determination updating the GEMS determination against which the model was initially registered. This might affect whether products of the model can be supplied, or used for commercial purposes.

    * There is a broad concept of supply and offer to supply. This affects the application of the main rules in Division 2 of Part 3 about supplying and offering to supply GEMS products.

#### Division 2--Key concepts

##### 11  GEMS products, GEMS determinations and product classes

    * (1) A **_GEMS product_** is a product that:

     * (a) uses energy or affects the amount of energy used by another product; and

     * (b) is in a product class covered by a GEMS determination.

    * (2) A **_GEMS determination_** is a determination made by the Minister under section 23 that:

     * (a) specifies one or more classes of products (**_product classes_**) that it covers; and

     * (b) specifies requirements for products in those product classes in accordance with Part 4.

        * Note 1: For paragraph (a), a class of products may be specified by reference to a range of matters, including:

         * (a) the function the products perform; and

         * (b) the materials from which the products are manufactured; and

         * (c) the size or capacity of the products; and

         * (d) whether the products contain a particular feature (for example a screen or monitor) or are capable of operating in different modes (for example in standby mode).

        * Note 2: For when a GEMS determination is in force, see sections 34 and 35.

    * (3) A single product may be in more than one product class (whether or not specified in the same GEMS determination).

        * Note: If a single product is in more than one product class, the product must comply with requirements under this Act for each of those product classes.

        * For example, a product that operates both as a washing machine and as a clothes dryer would need to comply with separate requirements for washing machines (where washing machines are a product class) and clothes dryers (where clothes dryers are a product class).

    * (4) A GEMS product in a product class covered by a GEMS determination is either a **_category A product_** or a **_category B product_** for that product class, as specified in the determination (see section 29).

        * Note: Different penalty levels apply for certain offences under this Act, depending on whether a product is a category A product or a category B product for a product class.

    * (5) A **_replacement determination_** is a GEMS determination made in accordance with section 35 that specifies that it replaces another GEMS determination (a **_revoked determination_**).

##### 12  Models of GEMS products to be registered in relation to product classes

    * (1) A model of a GEMS product in a particular product class must be registered under Part 5 in relation to that product class, unless the model is exempt from registration in relation to that product class as specified in a GEMS determination (see section 30).

        * Note 1: If the model is in more than one product class, the model will need to be registered under Part 5 in relation to each of those product classes.

        * Note 2: Offences apply in relation to supplying a GEMS product, or using a GEMS product for a commercial purpose, if the model of the product is not registered (see Part 3).

    * (2) Two or more GEMS products are of the same **_model_** if, and only if:

     * (a) the products have the same technical specifications, in so far as those specifications relate to the extent to which the products comply with the requirements of this Act; and

     * (b) either:

      * (i) there is a single brand or trade mark used in supplying or offering to supply the products; or

      * (ii) if there is no such brand or trade mark--the products have the same manufacturer; and

     * (c) there is a single unique identifier (the **_model identifier_**) used in supplying or offering to supply the products, or manufacturing the products, to identify the products as being of that model.

        * Note 1: The expression **_this Act_** has an extended meaning (see the Dictionary in section 5).

        * Note 2: A model may be registered in relation to a product class even if there is only one product of that model (see subsection 41(2)).

    * (3) A single registration may cover 2 or more models in relation to a product class only if those models are in the same **_family of models_** in accordance with the GEMS determination for that product class (see section 28).

    * (4) A model cannot be covered by more than one registration in relation to a particular product class.

##### 13  Models to be registered against GEMS determinations

    * (1) Under Part 5, a model of a GEMS product is **_registered against _**a GEMS determination in relation to a product class.

    * (2) The GEMS determination against which the model is registered in relation to the product class is either:

     * (a) the GEMS determination against which the model is registered under section 43 (registration by the GEMS Regulator); or

     * (b) a replacement determination against which the model is taken to be registered because of subsection 36(2) (registration not affected by replacement determination).

    * (3) A model's registration in relation to a product class is, or is not, **_affected _**by a replacement determination as specified in the replacement determination (see section 36).

        * Note: If a model's registration is affected by a replacement determination:

         * (a) the registration will cease to be in force under section 48 on the day the replacement determination comes into force; and

         * (b) products of the model imported into, or manufactured in, Australia after the replacement determination comes into force might not be able to be supplied, or used for a commercial purpose, unless the model is registered against the replacement determination (see Part 3).

##### 14  Supplying and offering to supply GEMS products

    * (1) A **_supply_** of a GEMS product includes a supply of the product by way of sale, exchange, gift, lease, loan, hire or hirepurchase.

    * (2) For the purposes of subsection (1), it is irrelevant whether the supply is:

     * (a) for consideration; or

     * (b) a wholesale or retail supply.

        * Note: Offences under this Act relating to supplying, or offering to supply, GEMS products do not apply in relation to secondhand products.

    * (3) **_Offer to supply_** a GEMS product includes make available, expose, display or advertise the product for supply.

### Part 3--Requirements for suppliers and commercial users of GEMS products

#### Division 1--Guide to this Part

##### 15  Guide to this Part

    * This Part sets out the main rules that govern supplying and offering to supply GEMS products and using GEMS products for commercial purposes.

    * Division 2 permits a GEMS product to be supplied or offered for supply only if certain GEMS determination requirements and registration requirements have been complied with.

    * Division 3 permits a GEMS product to be used for a commercial purpose only if certain GEMS determination requirements and registration requirements have been complied with.

    * Generally speaking, a product imported into, or manufactured in, Australia before the relevant GEMS determination comes into force may continue indefinitely to be supplied (or offered for supply), or used for a commercial purpose, without complying with the requirements of the GEMS determination or being registered against it (unless there is a limited grandfathering period (see section 31)).

    * The rules in Division 2 governing supplying, and offering to supply, GEMS products do not apply to secondhand products. The rules in Division 3 governing use of GEMS products for commercial purposes do not apply to products supplied to the user in Australia.

    * A particular model of a GEMS product may be exempt (under section 37) from particular requirements of GEMS determinations on certain conditions. In addition, models of products in a particular product class may be exempt (under section 30) from registration requirements in relation to that product class.

    * A particular use of a GEMS product may also be exempt from the application of the rules in Division 3 if it is personal use, for testing purposes or is prescribed by the regulations (see section 20).

    * Contravening the rules in Division 2 or 3 may result in prosecution for offences or exposure to liability for civil penalties. All offences are strict liability. Different penalties apply depending on whether the relevant GEMS product is a category A or a category B product.

    * Division 4 sets out general provisions about the supply and use of GEMS products, and in particular the potential constitutional limitations that might apply.

### Part 4--GEMS determinations

#### Division 1--Guide to this Part

##### 22  Guide to this Part

    * This Part is about how GEMS determinations are made, and the requirements (GEMS requirements) which are imposed by the determinations.

    * Division 2 provides for GEMS determinations to be made by Ministerial determination, subject to the consent of a certain number of States and Territories to the making and replacement of GEMS determinations.

    * GEMS determinations must contain requirements relating to energy use or greenhouse gas production (GEMS level requirements) or requirements about labelling (GEMS labelling requirements). They may also contain other requirements relating to efficiency levels, performance, the environment and human health.

    * Division 3 provides for GEMS determinations to be updated by replacement determinations. Replacement determinations must specify whether they affect the registration of models of GEMS products.

    * If a replacement determination affects a model's registration, the registration ceases to be in force under Part 5 from the time the replacement determination comes into force. This might affect a person's ability to supply or use for a commercial purpose products of the model imported into, or manufactured in, Australia after that time (see Part 3).

    * If a replacement determination does not affect a model's registration, the model is taken to continue to be registered against the replacement determination, and may continue to be supplied (or offered for supply) and used for commercial purposes relying on that registration.

    * Division 4 allows product models to be exempted from requirements of GEMS determinations.

#### Division 2--Making GEMS determinations

##### 23  Minister may make GEMS determinations

    * (1) The Minister may, by legislative instrument, make a determination that specifies one or more classes of products that it covers, if the products in those classes:

        * Note: Requirements under paragraph (a) or (b) may relate, for example, to one or more of the following:

         * (a) the characteristics, contents, placement and quality of labels or marks attached or applied to products or displayed on packaging for products;

         * (b) documents or other material used for, or provided in connection with, the supply of products;

         * (c) advertising products.

    * (2) A requirement may only be specified under paragraph (1)(a) or (b) in relation to a product class for the purpose of:

     * (a) ensuring that products in that product class can be compared with other products in relation to a matter that is, or could be, the subject of a requirement of the GEMS determination for that product class; or

     * (b) assisting with monitoring compliance with this Act; or

     * (c) providing a transition to regulation of products in the product class under the GEMS determination (including because the products were not previously covered by a GEMS determination or because the GEMS determination is a replacement determination).

        * Note 1: The expression **_this Act_** has an extended meaning (see the Dictionary in section 5).

        * Note 2: A requirement specified for the purpose of paragraph (2)(c) is a **_transitional GEMS labelling requirement_**.

##### 27  GEMS requirements--other requirements

##### 31  GEMS determinations--limited grandfathering period

    * (1) A GEMS determination may specify, for a product class covered by the determination, a **_limited grandfathering period_** for products in the product class.

    * (2) The limited grandfathering period:

     * (a) starts when the GEMS determination comes into force; and

     * (b) ends at a time specified in the GEMS determination.

        * Note: The effect of specifying a limited grandfathering period is that a product in the product class imported into, or whose last process of manufacture is performed in, Australia before the GEMS determination comes into force might not be able to be supplied or used for a commercial purpose after the end of that period unless:

         * (a) the product complies with the GEMS determination; and
