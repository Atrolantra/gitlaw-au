    * (3) If the person is covered by subclause 13(2) (but not subclause 13(1)), the person's **_exempt bond amount_** is the gross proceeds of the sale mentioned in that subclause, less:

    * (6) But in all of the above cases, if the person currently has a partner (who is not deceased), the person's **_exempt bond amount_** is half of what it would otherwise be.

    * (2) In working out the amount of a payment under this Act payable to a partner of the person, assume that the service pension or income support supplement payable to the person is payable at the rate at which it would be payable if clause 30 had not been enacted.

##### 34  Payment and income tax consequences of receiving service pension or income support supplement at rate affected by clause 30

    * Application

    * (1) This clause applies if clause 30 affects the rate at which service pension or income support supplement is payable to a person.

    * Purpose

    * (2) The purpose of this clause is to ensure that the person is treated appropriately in relation to the payment, and income taxation, of the pension or supplement by modifying the operation of this Act (and thus affecting the related income tax law) in relation to the person and the pension or supplement.

       * Note: This clause does not modify the operation of subsection 5GA(3), which provides for working out the person's minimum pension supplement amount.

    * Pension supplement amount

    * (3) This Act applies in relation to the person's pension or supplement as if each of the following:

     * (a) the amount described in subparagraph 30(4)(a)(i), as affected by any indexation and any relevant reduction described in paragraph 30(4)(a);

     * (b) the amount described in subparagraph 30(6)(a)(i), as affected by any indexation and any relevant reduction described in paragraph 30(6)(a);

    * were an amount worked out and added under the pension supplement Module of the Rate Calculator.

       * Note 1: One effect of subclause (3) is that whichever of the amounts described in paragraphs (3)(a) and (b) is relevant is the person's pension supplement amount (as defined in subsection 5Q(1) of this Act).

       * Note 2: If that amount exceeds the person's pension supplement basic amount (as affected by subclause (4)), another effect of subclause (3) is that the excess affects the taxexempt pension supplement under subsection 5GA(5) of this Act in some cases.

       * Note 3: Yet another effect of subclause (3) is that clause 4 of Schedule 6 will affect the operation of reductions of the maximum payment rate because of the income test and assets test in some cases.

    * Pension supplement basic amount

    * (4) This Act applies in relation to the person's service pension or income support supplement as if:

     * (a) each reference in the table in subsection 5GA(4) to $509.60 were a reference to $14,903.20; and

     * (b) the reference in the table in subsection 5GA(4) to $426.40 were a reference to $12,448.80.

       * Note 1: This affects the person's pension supplement basic amount.

       * Note 2: The provisions for indexing amounts in the table in subsection 5GA(4) apply to the higher figures mentioned in this subclause.

    * Energy supplement

    * (5) If subclause 31(1) or (2) is relevant to the person, this Act applies in relation to the person's service pension as if the person's energy supplement (if any) resulting from Module BB of the Rate Calculator were used to work out the rate of the person's service pension.

       * Note 1: This energy supplement is included in the total worked out under paragraph 30(4)(a) (see subparagraph 30(4)(a)(ia)).

       * Note 2: Subclause (5) causes section 62E to apply. If quarterly energy supplement is payable, then no energy supplement will be available to be included in the total worked out under paragraph 30(4)(a) (see point SCH6BB2 of the Rate Calculator).

       * Note 3: Other effects of subclause (5) include:

        * (a) the possibility of the minimum amount of fortnightly instalments of the pension being affected under section 58A; and

        * (b) clause 4 of Schedule 6 affecting the operation of reductions of the maximum payment rate because of the ordinary/adjusted income test and assets test.

##### 35  Special rules for indexation of rates payable under clause 30

    * (1) This clause applies if clause 30 affects the rate at which service pension is payable to a person for a day on or after 20 March 2013.

    * (2) Subsection 198MA(2), and the definition of **_brought forward CPI indexation amount_** (except paragraph (b) of that definition) in subsection 198MA(3), apply in relation to the amount described in subparagraph 30(4)(a)(i) of this Schedule for the person in the same way as they apply in relation to the person's PS minimum rate.

    * (3) The following provisions do not affect the rate of the person's service pension worked out under clause 30 or an amount worked out in relation to the person's pension because of clause 34:

     * (a) subparagraph 198MA(2)(b)(vi);

     * (b) section 198MB.

## Schedule 6--Calculation of rates of service pension and income support supplement

### Part 1--Preliminary

##### 1  Steps in rate calculation

    * (1) The following are the usual steps in the rate calculation process:

     * (a) start with a maximum basic rate;

     * (b) add any additional amounts that are subject to income or assets testing;

     * (c) apply the income and assets tests;

     * (d) add any additional amounts that are not subject to income or assets testing.

       * Note 1: The additional amounts referred to in paragraph (b) are amounts for pension supplement, energy supplement and rent assistance.

       * Note 2: The only additional amount for the purposes of paragraph (d) at this time is remote area allowance.

    * (2) The overall rate calculation process is described in the relevant Method statement in Module A of the Rate calculator.

##### 2  Standard categories of family situations

    * (1) The Rate Calculator uses the following standard categories of family situations:

     * (a) not member of a couple;

     * (b) member of a couple _or_ partnered;

     * (c) member of an illness separated couple;

     * (d) member of a respite care couple;

     * (e) partnered (partner getting neither pension nor benefit);

     * (f) partnered (partner getting pension);

     * (g) partnered (partner getting benefit).

       * Note: See sections 5E and 5R for definitions of those terms.

    * (2) If it is necessary to distinguish between the members of subcategories of these standard categories, further words of description are added to the standard category label.

##### 3  Explanation of Rate Calculator

    * (1) The Rate Calculator is divided into Modules (for example, Module A).

    * (2) A Module of the Rate Calculator is divided into points.

    * (3) The points in a Module are identified by:

     * (a) the letters and number SCH6 (followed by a dash), which indicate that the Module is in the Rate Calculator in this Schedule; and

     * (b) a letter that is the letter allocated to the Module in which the point occurs; and

     * (c) a number that identifies the order of the point within the Module.

       * Example: Point SCH6E2 is the 2nd point in Module E of the Rate Calculator in this Schedule.

    * (4) A point in a Module may be divided into subpoints.

##### 4  Application for income tax purposes of reductions in respect of service pension or income support supplement

    * Service pension

    * (1) If a person's rate of service pension is affected by a reduction under any or all of the following:

     * (a) Module E (ordinary/adjusted income test) of the Rate Calculator;

     * (b) Module F (assets test) of the Rate Calculator;

     * (c) section 59T (compensation recovery);

    * the reduction is to be applied as follows (in descending order):

       * Note 1: Table item 4A will not apply if an election by the person under subsection 60A(1) is in force, as there will not be any increase under Module BB (see point SCH6BB2 of the Rate Calculator).

       * Note 2: Table item 5 will not apply if an election by the person under subsection 60A(1) is in force, as the rate would have already been reduced to nil.

    * (2) If a person's rate of service pension:

     * (a) is worked out under subpoint SCH6A1(4) of Schedule 6 and is the revised rate; or

     * (b) is worked out under subpoint SCH6A1(5) of Schedule 6;

    * subclause (1) applies in relation to the person and the pension as if:

     * (c) paragraphs (1)(a) and (b) were omitted; and

     * (d) the person had a pension supplement amount equal to what would be the person's pension supplement amount if the person were receiving the service pension at the rate worked out under subpoint SCH6A1(4) of Schedule 6 and equal to the provisional rate.

    * Income support supplement

    * (3) If a person's rate of income support supplement is affected by a reduction under any or all of the following:

     * (a) Module E (ordinary/adjusted income test) of the Rate Calculator;

     * (b) Module F (assets test) of the Rate Calculator;

     * (c) section 59T (compensation recovery);

    * the reduction is to be applied as follows (in descending order):

    * Quarterly pension supplement

    * (4) If:

     * (a) the rate (the **_main rate_**) of a person's service pension or income support supplement is to be reduced as described in subclause (1) (applying of its own force or as affected by subclause (2)) or subclause (3); and

     * (b) an election by the person under subsection 60A(1) is in force;

    * the person's quarterly pension supplement is reduced to the same extent (if any) that the component of the main rate that would correspond to the person's minimum pension supplement amount would be reduced under subclause (1) or (3) were the election not in force.

       * Note: The reduction will be disregarded unless the person's quarterly pension supplement is reduced to nil (see subsection 60C(4)).

    * Quarterly energy supplement for service pension

    * (5) If:

     * (a) the rate (the **_main rate_**) of a person's service pension is to be reduced as described in subclause (1) (applying of its own force or as affected by subclause (2)); and

     * (b) an election by the person under subsection 60A(1) is in force;

    * the person's quarterly energy supplement is reduced to the same extent (if any) that the component of the main rate that would correspond to the person's energy supplement would be reduced under subclause (1) were the election not in force.

       * Note: The reduction will be disregarded unless the main rate would be reduced to nil (see subsection 62E(6)).

##### 5  Commencing rates

    * (1) The amounts and rates set out in the Rate Calculator at the time of commencement of this Schedule (the **_commencing time_**) are the same as the corresponding amounts and rates that applied under this Act as in force on 1 January 1997.

    * (2) However, each amount or rate so set out that is subject to indexation or adjustment under Division 18 of Part IIIB is taken to be replaced immediately after the commencing time by the amount or rate that would have been in force at that time as a result of the application of that Division if this Schedule had commenced on 1 January 1997.

### Part 2--Rate Calculator

#### Module A--Overall rate calculation process

    * Rate to be an annual rate

    * SCH6A1(1)	The rate of pension is an annual rate (fortnightly amounts are provided for information only).

    * Method statement 1 (service pension, not blind, not war widow/war widower--pensioner)

    * (2) The rate of service pension for a person who:

     * (a) is not permanently blind; and

     * (b) is not a war widow/war widower--pensioner;

    * is worked out in accordance with Method statement 1.

       * Note: For **_war widow/war widower--pensioner_** see subsection 5Q(1).

Method statement 1

      * Step 1.	Work out the person's **_maximum basic rate _**using MODULE B below.

      * Step 1A.	Work out the amount of pension supplement using Module BA below.

      * Step 1B.	Work out the amount of energy supplement (if any) using Module BB below.

      * Step 2.	Work out the amount per year (if any) by way of rent assistance using MODULE C below.

      * Step 4.	Add up the amounts obtained in Steps 1, 1A, 1B and 2: the result is called the **_maximum payment rate_**.

          * Note: Section 65A may affect whether the amount obtained in step 1B is added.

      * Step 5.	Apply the ordinary/adjusted income test using MODULE E below to work out the reduction for ordinary/adjusted income.

      * Step 6.	Take the reduction for ordinary/adjusted income away from the maximum payment rate: the result is called the **_income reduced rate_**.

      * Step 7.	Apply the assets test using MODULE F below to work out the reduction for assets.

      * Step 8.	Take the reduction for assets away from the maximum payment rate: the result is called the **_assets reduced rate_**.

      * Step 9.	Compare the income reduced rate and the assets reduced rate: the lower of the 2 rates, or the income reduced rate if the rates are equal, is the **_provisional payment rate_**.

      * Step 10.	Work out the amount per year (if any) payable by way of remote area allowance using MODULE G below.

      * Step 11.	Add any amount obtained in Step 10 to the person's provisional payment rate (see Step 9). The result is the person's **_rate of service pension_**.

          * Note 1: For ordinary/adjusted income see point SCH6E1.

          * Note 2: If a person's assets reduced rate is less than the person's ordinary/adjusted income reduced rate, the person may be able to take advantage of provisions dealing with financial hardship (sections 52Y and 52Z).

          * Note 3: If a person's rate is, or is to be, an income reduced rate or an assets reduced rate, and at least one of those reduced rates is not a nil rate, the person may be able to take advantage of provisions dealing with the pension loans scheme (sections 52ZAAA to 52ZM).

          * Note 4: If a person's rate is reduced under step 9, the order in which the reduction is to be made against the components of the maximum payment rate is laid down by clause 4 of Part 1.

          * Note 4A: Clause 30 of Schedule 5 may affect the provisional payment rate in step 9.

          * Note 5: The rate calculation for a member of a couple is affected by the operation of point SCH6A2.

          * Note 6.	The amount of a fortnightly instalment of service pension will be rounded to the nearest cent (see subsection 58A(5)).

          * Note 7: For the minimum amount of a fortnightly instalment of service pension, see subsection 58A(9).

          * Note 8: An amount of remote area allowance is to be added under Step 11 only if the person's rate of service pension is greater than nil or, apart from section 36A, 37A or 38A, the person's rate of service pension would be nil.

          * Note 9: The amount of a fortnightly instalment of service pension may be reduced by an advance payment deduction (see Division 6 of Part IVA).

    * Method statement 2 (service pension, blind, not war widow/war widower--pensioner)

    * (3) The rate of service pension for a person who:

     * (a) is permanently blind; and

     * (b) is not a war widow/war widower--pensioner;

    * is worked out in accordance with Method statement 2.

       * Note: For **_war widow/war widower--pensioner_** see subsection 5Q(1).

Method statement 2

      * Step 1.	Work out what would be the person's rate of service pension if Method statement 1 applied to the person: the result is called the **_notional income/assets tested rate_**.

         * Note: This is the only situation in which a blind person's pension can be made subject to an income test or assets test (see point SCH6A3).

      * Step 2.	Work out the person's **_maximum basic rate _**using MODULE B below.

      * Step 2A.	Work out the amount of pension supplement using Module BA below.

      * Step 2B.	Work out the amount of energy supplement (if any) using Module BB below.

      * Step 4.	Add up the amounts obtained in Steps 2, 2A and 2B: the result is called the **_maximum payment rate_**.

      * Step 5.	Work out the amount per year (if any) payable by way of remote area allowance using MODULE G below.

      * Step 6.	Add:

       * (a) the maximum payment rate; and

       * (b) any amount obtained under Step 5.

      * The result is called the **_nonincome/assets tested rate_**.

      * Step 7.	Compare the notional income/assets tested rate and the nonincome/assets tested rate: whichever is the greater is the person's **_rate of service pension_**.

          * Note 1: The amount of a fortnightly instalment of service pension will be rounded to the nearest cent (see subsection 58A(5)).

          * Note 2: For the minimum amount of a fortnightly instalment of service pension, see subsection 58A(9).

          * Note 3: The amount of a fortnightly instalment of service pension may be reduced by an advance payment deduction (see Division 6 of Part IVA).

       * (c) any amount obtained under step 4;

      * and, if an election by the person under subsection 60A(1) (about quarterly pension supplement) is in force, subtract the person's minimum pension supplement amount. The result is the **_revised rate_**.

      * Step 6.	Compare the provisional rate and the revised rate: the person's **_rate of service pension_** is:

       * (a) the provisional rate if it is lower than the revised rate; or

       * (b) the revised rate if it is lower than or equal to the provisional rate.

      * and, if an election by the person under subsection 60A(1) (about quarterly pension supplement) is in force, subtract the person's minimum pension supplement amount. The result is the **_increased rate_**.

      * Step 10.	Compare the income reduced rate (see Step 6), the assets reduced rate (see Step 8) and the increased rate (see step 9A): the person's **_provisional payment rate_** is equal to:

       * (a) whichever is the lowest of those rates; or

     * (c) since that day the person has been continuously receiving the social security pension or income support supplement;

    * his or her ceiling rate is, subject to point SCH6A5A, equal to the preNovember 1986 rate.

       * Note: For _war widow/war widower_**--**_pensioner _see subsection 5Q(1).

    * SCH6A5A	On and after 1 July 2000, the ceiling rate referred to in point SCH6A5 is taken to be equal to the preNovember 1986 rate increased by 4%.

    * SCH6A6	However, if:

     * (a) a war widow/war widower--pensioner is a person:

      * (i) to whom income support supplement or service pension is payable; and

      * (ii) who is not permanently blind; and

     * (b) the person's pension under Part II or IV is compensation reduced;

    * the ceiling rate for the war widow/war widower--pensioner is the sum of:

     * (c) the rate applying under point SCH6A4 or SCH6A5, as the case may be; and

     * (d) the amount of the reduction in the pension under Part II or IV worked out under points SCH6A7 to SCH6A9.

       * Note: For _war widow_**/**_war widower_**--**_pensioner_ see subsection 5Q(1).

    * Compensation reduced pension under Part II or IV

    * SCH6A7	A pension under Part II payable to a war widow/war widower--pensioner is **_compensation reduced_** if that pension has been reduced:

     * (a) by taking into account (under subsection 30(3)) the rate, or amount, of any payment that he or she is entitled to receive under the law of a State or of a foreign country; or

     * (b) by taking into account (under Division 5A of that Part) the rate at which any compensation is payable to him or her.

       * Note: For _war widow_**/**_war widower_**--**_pensioner_ see subsection 5Q(1).

    * SCH6A8	A pension under Part IV payable to a war widow/war widower--pensioner is **_compensation reduced_** if that pension has been reduced by taking into account (under Division 4 of that Part) the rate at which any compensation is payable to him or her.

       * Note: For _war widow_**/**_war widower_**--**_pensioner_ see subsection 5Q(1).

    * SCH6A9	The **_amount of the reduction in the pension under Part II or IV _**is worked out by using the formula:

    * where: 

    * **_full pension rate_** means the amount per annum that would have been the annual rate of the pension under Part II or IV if it had not been reduced.

    * **_compensation reduced rate_** means the annual rate of pension under Part II or IV payable after that pension has been reduced.

#### Module B--Maximum basic rate

    * Maximum basic rate

     * rounding the amount up or down to the nearest multiple of $2.60 (rounding up if the amount is not a multiple of $2.60 but is a multiple of $1.30).

       * Note: For **_combined couple rate of pension supplement_**_, _see subsection 5GA(1).

    * Residents in Australia etc.--election in force

    * SCH6BA4	The person's pension supplement amount is the amount worked out as follows:

     * (a) work out the amount for the person under point SCH6BA3 as if the election were not in force;

     * (b) from that amount, subtract the person's minimum pension supplement amount.

    * Persons absent from Australia for more than 6 weeks

    * Rent paid by a member of a couple

    * SCH6C10	If a person is a member of a couple and the person's partner is living with the person in their home, any rent that the person's partner pays or is liable to pay in respect of the home is to be treated as paid or payable by the person.

       * Note: For **_member of a couple_** see section 5E.

    * Rent paid by a member of an illness separated or respite care couple

    * SCH6C11	If a person is a member of an illness separated couple or a respite care couple, any rent that the person's partner pays or is liable to pay in respect of the premises occupied by the person is to be treated as paid or payable by the person.

       * Note: For **_illness separated couple_** and **_respite care couple_** see subsections 5R(5) and (6).

    * Application

    * SCH6C12	Points SCH6C13 and SCH6C14 apply only to a person who is in receipt of a service pension. If such a person or the partner of such a person receives either or both a disability pension and permanent impairment compensation, the amount of rent assistance worked out under Table C2 may be reduced under point SCH6C13.

       * Note 1: For **_disability pension_** see section 5Q.

       * Note 2: For **_permanent impairment compensation _**see point SCH6C16.

    * Effect of disability pension and permanent impairment compensation on rate of rent assistance

    * SCH6C13	This is how to work out the effect of a person's disability pension and permanent impairment compensation on the person's rate of rent assistance:

Method statement

      * Step 1.	Work out the annual rate of the person's disability pension and permanent impairment compensation: the result is the person's **_disability income_**.

          * Note 1: For **_disability pension_** see section 5Q.

          * Note 1A: For **_permanent impairment_** compensation see point SCH6C16.

          * Note 2: For the treatment of the amount of disability pension and permanent impairment compensation of members of a couple see point SCH6C14.

      * Step 2.	Work out the person's rent assistance free area (see point SCH6C15 below).

      * Step 3.	Work out whether the person's disability income exceeds the person's rent assistance free area.

      * Step 4.	If the person's disability income does not exceed the person's rent assistance free area, the person's rate of rent assistance worked out under Table C2 is not affected.

      * Step 5.	If the person's disability income exceeds the person's rent assistance free area, take the person's rent assistance free area away from the person's disability income: the result is the person's **_disability income excess_**.

      * Step 6.	Multiply the person's disability income excess by 0.5: the result is the **_rent assistance reduction amount_**.

      * Step 7.	Take the person's rent assistance reduction amount away from the rate of rent assistance worked out under Table C2: the result is the person's **_rate of rent assistance_**.

    * Disability income

    * SCH6C14	If a person is a member of a couple, the person's disability income for the purposes of this Module is worked out as follows:

     * (a) if each member of the couple receives either or both a disability pension and permanent impairment compensation--by adding the couple's annual rates of disability pension and permanent impairment compensation and dividing the result by 2;

     * (b) if only one member of the couple receives either or both a disability pension and permanent impairment compensation:

      * (i) where the member receives both a disability pension and permanent impairment compensation--by adding the member's annual rates of disability pension and permanent impairment compensation and dividing the result by 2; or

      * (ii) where subparagraph (i) does not apply--by dividing the member's annual rate of disability pension or permanent impairment compensation by 2.

       * Note 1: For **_disability pension_** see section 5Q.

       * Note 2: For permanent impairment compensation see point SCH6C16.

    * Application

    * SCH6C14A	Points SCH6C14B and SCH6C14C apply only to a person who is in receipt of an income support supplement. If such a person, or the partner of such a person, receives adjusted disability pension, the amount of rent assistance worked out under Table C2 may be reduced under point SCH6C14B.

       * Note: For **_adjusted disability pension_** see point SCH6C16.

    * Effect of adjusted disability pension on rate of rent assistance

    * SCH6C14B	This is how to work out the effect of a person's adjusted disability pension on the person's rate of rent assistance:

Method statement

      * Step 1.	Work out the annual rate of the person's adjusted disability pension: the result is the person's **_disability income_**.

          * Note 1: For **_adjusted disability pension_** see point SCH6C16.

          * Note 2: For the treatment of the amount of adjusted disability pension of members of a couple see point SCH6C14C.

      * Step 2.	Work out the person's rent assistance free area (see point SCH6C15 below).

      * Step 3.	Work out whether the person's disability income exceeds the person's rent assistance free area.

      * Step 4.	If the person's disability income does not exceed the person's rent assistance free area, the person's rate of rent assistance worked out under Table C2 is not affected.

      * Step 5.	If the person's disability income exceeds the person's rent assistance free area, take the person's rent assistance free area away from the person's disability income: the result is the person's **_disability income excess_**.

      * Step 6.	Multiply the person's disability income excess by 0.5: the result is the **_rent assistance reduction amount_**.

      * Step 7.	Take the person's rent assistance reduction amount away from the rate of rent assistance worked out under Table C2: the result is the person's **_rate of rent assistance_**.

    * Disability income

    * SCH6C14C	If a person is a member of a couple, the person's disability income for the purposes of SCH6C14B is worked out as follows:

     * (a) if each member of the couple receives adjusted disability pension--by adding the couple's annual rates of adjusted disability pension and dividing the result by 2;

     * (b) if only one member of the couple receives adjusted disability pension--by dividing the member's annual rate of adjusted disability pension by 2.

       * Note: For **_adjusted disability pension_** see point SCH6C16.

    * How to calculate a person's rent free area

    * SCH6C15	A person's rent assistance free area is worked out using Table C3. Work out which family situation in Table C3 applies to the person.

       * Note 1: For **_member of a couple _**and**_ partnered _**see section 5E.

       * Note 2: Item 2 of Table C3 applies to members of illness separated and respite care couples.

       * Note 3: The free areas are adjusted annually (see section 59GA).

       * Rent assistance examples

       * Note: The following examples are based on the amounts and rates set out in this Module at the commencement of this Schedule (see clause 5 of Part 1 of this Schedule).

       * Example 1: 

       * Facts: Ross is a single service pensioner without children. Ross does not receive any disability pension and pays $120 per week rent.

       * Result: Item 1 in Table C2 applies to Ross.

       * Rate A for Ross is $3,287.70 calculated as follows:

       * Rate B for Ross is $1,939.60.

       * As the maximum rate of rent assistance is the lesser of Rates A and B, Ross's rate of rent assistance is 1,939.60 per year. Ross will receive $74.60 per fortnight.

       * Example 2: 

       * Facts: Ted and Pam are members of a pensioner couple without children. They rent a house for $160 per week. Ted receives 100% disability pension ($6,255.60 per year). Pam receives the wife's component of disability pension ($210.60 per year).

       * Result: Item 2 in Table C2 applies to Ted and Pam.

       * Rate A for Ted is $2,553.50 calculated as follows:

       * Rate B for Ted is $915.20.

       * As the lesser rate is $915.20, this is the maximum rent assistance that Ted can receive. However, as both Ted and Pam receive disability pension, the Rent Assistance Income Test in point SCH6C13 applies.

       * Ted's disability pension income is:

       * Item 2 of Table C3 applies. Ted's disability pension income excess is the disability pension income less the rent assistance free area:

       * The reduction in rent assistance is: 

       * The rent assistance Ted will receive per year is Rate B less amount of rent reduction: 

       * Ted will receive $16.03 per fortnight.

       * The same calculation applies to Pam's rate of rent assistance.

    * SCH6C16	In this Module: 

    * **_adjusted disability pension_** has the same meaning as in section 118NA.

    * **_permanent impairment compensation _**means:

     * (a) any payment of a weekly amount under section 68, 71 or 75 of the MRCA (permanent impairment); and

     * (b) if the person was paid a lump sum under section 68, 71 or 75 of the MRCA (permanent impairment)--any weekly amounts that the person would have been paid if the person had not chosen the lump sum.

#### Module E--Ordinary/adjusted income test

    * Definition

    * SCH6E1	In this Module: 

    * **_ordinary/adjusted income_** means:

     * (a) for the purpose of the calculation of the rate of service pension--ordinary income; or

     * (b) for the purpose of the calculation of the rate of income support supplement--adjusted income.

       * Note: For **_ordinary income_** and **_adjusted income_** see section 5H.

    * Effect of income on maximum payment rate

    * SCH6E2	This is how to work out the effect of a person's ordinary/adjusted income on the person's maximum payment rate:

Method statement

      * Step 1.	Work out the annual rate of the person's ordinary/adjusted income.

         * Note: For the treatment of the ordinary/adjusted income of members of a couple see point SCH6E3.

      * Step 2.	Work out the person's ordinary/adjusted income free area (see point SCH6E6 below).

          * Note: A person's ordinary/adjusted income free area is the maximum amount of ordinary/adjusted income the person can have without affecting the person's pension rate.

      * Step 3.	Work out whether the person's ordinary/adjusted income exceeds the person's ordinary/adjusted income free area.

      * Step 4.	If the person's ordinary/adjusted income does not exceed the person's ordinary/adjusted income free area, the person's ordinary/adjusted income excess is nil.

      * Step 5.	If the person's ordinary/adjusted income exceeds the person's ordinary/adjusted income free area, the person's ordinary/adjusted income excess is the person's ordinary/adjusted income less the person's ordinary/adjusted income free area.

      * Step 6.	Use the person's ordinary/adjusted income excess to work out the person's reduction for ordinary/adjusted income using point SCH6E11 below.

          * Note 1: See the Method statements in point SCH6A1 for the significance of the person's reduction for ordinary/adjusted income.

          * Note 2: The application of the ordinary/adjusted income test is affected by provisions about the following:

           * (a) the general concept of ordinary income (sections 46 and 46A);

           * (aa) the work bonus (section 46AA);

           * (b) business income (sections 46B and 46C);

           * (c) income from financial assets (including income streams (short term) and certain income streams (long term)) (Division 3 of Part IIIB);

           * (d) income from income streams not covered by Division 3 of Part IIIB (Division 4 of Part IIIB);

           * (e) disposal of income (sections 4848E).

    * Ordinary/adjusted incomes of members of couples

    * SCH6E3	If a person is a member of a couple, add the annual rates of the couple's ordinary/adjusted incomes and divide by 2 to work out the amount of the person's ordinary/adjusted income for the purposes of this Module. However, in making this calculation disregard any amount that is taken (whether for the purposes of this Act or of the Social Security Act) to be ordinary income of either partner because of section 59TA of this Act or section 1174 of the Social Security Act.

    * Additional ordinary income because of excess compensation payments

    * SCH6E3A	Add to the amount derived for a person under point SCH6E3 any amount that is taken (whether for the purposes of this Act or of the Social Security Act) to be ordinary income of the person because of section 59TA of this Act or section 1174 of the Social Security Act.

    * Payment of arrears of periodic compensation payments

    * SCH6E4	If: 

     * (a) at the time of an event that gives rise to an entitlement of a person to compensation, the person is receiving a compensation affected pension; and

     * (b) in relation to the entitlement, the person receives a payment (an **_arrears payment_**) of arrears of periodic compensation;

    * the person is taken to receive on each day in the periodic payments period an amount calculated by dividing the amount of the arrears payment by the number of days in the periodic payments period.

       * Note: For **_event that gives rise to an entitlement to compensation_**, **_compensation affected pension _**and **_periodic payments period_** see section 5NB.

    * Ordinary/adjusted income free area

    * SCH6E5	A person's ordinary/adjusted income free area is the amount of ordinary/adjusted income the person can have without any deduction being made from the person's maximum payment rate.

    * How to calculate a person's ordinary/adjusted income free area

    * SCH6E6	A person's ordinary/adjusted income free area is worked out using Table E1. Work out which family situation in Table E1 applies to the person. The ordinary/adjusted income free area is the corresponding amount in column 3.

       * Note 1: For **_member of a couple_**,**_ partnered (partner getting neither pension nor benefit)_**, **_partnered (partner getting benefit)_** and **_partnered (partner getting pension)_** see section 5E.

       * Note 3: Items 2 and 3 of Table E1 apply to members of illness separated and respite care couples.

       * Note 4: The basic free area is indexed annually in line with CPI increases (see sections 59B to 59E).

    * Pension reduction for ordinary/adjusted income in excess of ordinary/adjusted income free area

    * SCH6E11 (1)	A person's reduction for ordinary/adjusted income is:

    * (2) In this point:

    * **_ordinary/adjusted income excess_**, in relation to a person, means the person's ordinary/adjusted income less the person's ordinary/adjusted income free area.

#### Module F--Assets test

    * Effect of assets on maximum payment rate

    * SCH6F1	This is how to work out the effect of a person's assets on the person's maximum payment rate:

Method statement

      * Step 1.	Work out the value of the person's assets.

          * Note 1: For the treatment of the assets of members of a couple see point SCH6F2.

          * Note 2: For the assets that are to be disregarded in valuing a person's assets see section 52.

          * Note 3: For the valuation of an asset that is subject to a charge or encumbrance see sections 52C and 52CA.

      * Step 2.	Work out the person's assets value limit (see point SCH6F3 below).

         * Note: A person's assets value limit is the maximum value of assets the person can have without affecting the person's pension rate.

      * Step 3.	Work out whether the value of the person's assets exceeds the person's assets value limit.

      * Step 4.	If the value of the person's assets does not exceed the person's assets value limit, the person's assets excess is nil.

      * Step 5.	If the value of the person's assets exceeds the person's assets value limit, the person's assets excess is the value of the person's assets less the person's assets value limit.

      * Step 6.	Use the person's assets excess to work out the person's reduction for assets using point SCH6F4 below.

          * Note 1: See the Method statements in point SCH6A1 for the significance of the person's reduction for assets.

          * Note 2: The application of the assets test is affected by provisions about the following:

           * (a) disposal of assets (sections 52E - 52JE);

           * (b) special residences (sections 52KA - 52X);

           * (c) financial hardship (sections 52Y and 52Z);

           * (d) the pensions loans scheme (sections 52ZAAA - 52ZM.

    * Value of assets of members of couples

    * SCH6F2	For the purposes of this Module: 

     * (a) the value of the assets of a member of a couple is taken to be 50% of the sum of:

      * (i) the value of the person's assets; and

      * (ii) the value of the person's partner's assets; and

     * (b) the value of the assets of a particular kind of a member of a couple is taken to be 50% of the sum of:

      * (i) the value of the person's assets of that kind; and

      * (ii) the value of the person's partner's assets of that kind.

    * Assets value limit

    * SCH6F3	A person's assets value limit is worked out using Table F1. Work out the person's family situation and property ownership situation. The assets value limit is the corresponding amount in column 3.

       * Note 1: For **_member of a couple_** and **_partnered_** see section 5E.

       * Note 2: For **_property owner_** see section 5L.

       * Note 3: Item 2 applies to members of illness separated and respite care couples.

       * Note 4: The assets value limit in column 3B of item 1 is adjusted annually in line with CPI increases (see section 59H). The other assets value limits are indexed annually in line with CPI increases (see sections 59B to 59E).

    * Pension reduction for assets in excess of assets value limit

    * SCH6F4(1)	A person's reduction for assets is worked out by using the formula:

    * where: 

    * **_assets excess_** means the value of the person's assets less the person's assets value limit.

    * (2) In calculating a person's assets excess under subpoint (1), disregard any part of the excess that is not a multiple of $250.

#### Module G--Remote area allowance

    * Remote area allowance

    * SCH6G1	An amount by way of remote area allowance is to be included in a person's rate of pension if:

     * (a) one of the following subparagraphs applies:

      * (i) the person's rate of pension apart from this point is greater than nil; or

      * (ii) the person's rate of pension apart from this point is nil merely because an advance pharmaceutical allowance has been paid to the person under Part 2.23 of the Social Security Act; or

      * (iii) the person's rate of pension apart from this point is nil merely because of the operation of Part IVA; and

     * (b) the person's usual place of residence is situated in the remote area; and

     * (c) the person is physically present in the remote area.

       * Note: For **_remote area_** and **_physically present in the remote area_** see section 5Q.

    * Rate of remote area allowance

    * SCH6G2	The rate of remote area allowance payable to a person is worked out using Table G. Work out which family situation in the table applies to the person.

    * (2) If an FTB child, or a regular care child, is temporarily absent from  for more than 8 weeks, additional allowance is not payable for the child after the first 8 weeks of the absence.

    * Special rule where partner has an FTB or regular care child but is not receiving a pension, benefit or allowance

    * SCH6G4	If: 

     * (a) a person who is a member of a couple is qualified for an amount by way of remote area allowance; and

     * (b) the person's partner is not receiving a service pension, an income support supplement, a social security pension, or a social security benefit; and

     * (c) the person's partner has an FTB child or a regular care child;

    * the child is taken, for the purposes of this Module, to be an FTB child, or a regular care child, (as the case requires) of the person.

    * Special rule where partner has an FTB or regular care child but is not receiving additional allowance for the child

    * SCH6G5	If: 

     * (a) a person who is a member of a couple is qualified for an amount by way of remote area allowance; and

     * (b) the person's partner has an FTB child or a regular care child; and

     * (c) the person's partner is not receiving additional allowance for the child;

    * the child is taken, for the purposes of this Module, to be an FTB child, or a regular care child, (as the case requires) of the person.

    * Special rule dealing with the death of an FTB or regular care child

    * SCH6G6	If an FTB child, or a regular care child, of a person dies, this Module has effect, for a period of 14 weeks after the death of the child, as if the child had not died.

       * Note: This point does not prevent this Module having the effect it would have had if the child would otherwise have ceased to be an FTB child, or a regular care child, during that 14 weeks.
