##### 118NB  Payment of Defence Force Income Support Allowance

     * (a) adjusted disability pension is payable to the person, or the person's partner, on that day; and

     * (b) social security pension or social security benefit (the **_primary payment_**) is payable to the person on that day; and

      * Note 1: For **_adjusted disability pension _**and **_partner_** see section 118NA.

      * Note 2: For **_social security pension_** and **_social security benefit_** see section 5Q.

      * Note 3: Even though the person may not actually be paid an amount of social security pension or benefit because the rate of the pension or benefit is nil, in some cases the pension or benefit will be taken to be payable to the person if adjusted disability pension is payable to the person or the person's partner: see subsection 23(1D) of the Social Security Act.

    * (2) However, DFISA is not payable to the person on that day if:

     * (a) the rate of DFISA would be nil; or

     * (b) section 1129, 1130B or 1131 of the Social Security Act (financial hardship) applies to the person in relation to the primary payment; or

     * (c) before that day:

      * (i) the person had elected not to be covered by this Division; and

      * (ii) that election had not been withdrawn.

    * (3) An election, or a withdrawal of an election, under paragraph (2)(c):

     * (a) must be by document lodged at an office of the Department in Australia in accordance with section 5T; and

     * (b) is taken to have been made on a day determined under that section.

##### Subdivision B--Rate of Defence Force Income Support Allowance

##### 118NC  Rate of Defence Force Income Support Allowance

    * _DFISA rate where primary payment is neither compensation affected nor prescribed_

    * _	(1)	The rate of DFISA on a day that is on or after 20 September 2004 is worked out using method statement 1 in this subsection, unless:

     * (a) Part 3.14 of the Social Security Act (compensation recovery) applies to reduce the rate of the primary payment on that day (in which case see method statement 2 in subsection (2)); or

     * (b) the primary payment is a social security pension or social security benefit that is prescribed for the purposes of this section (in which case, see subsection (3)).

      * Note: For **_primary payment_** see section 118NB.

    * _Method Statement 1_

      * Step 1_.	Work out the daily provisional payment rate for the primary payment on that day.

         * Note: For **_daily provisional payment rate _**see subsection (4).

      * _Step 2_.	Work out what would have been the daily provisional payment rate (the **_notional rate_**) for the primary payment on that day if both of the following assumptions were made:

      * _First assumption_

      * _	The first assumption is that the adjusted disability pension payable to the person, or the person's partner, were an excluded amount (see section 118NA).

         * Note: This will mean the adjusted disability pension will not be treated as income when calculating the notional rate.

      * _Second assumption_

      * _	The second assumption is that, if an amount of rent assistance was included in the primary payment, that amount were reduced (but not to less than nil) by the rent reduction amount.

         * Note: For **_rent assistance_** and **_rent reduction amount_** see subsection (4).

      * _Step 3_.	Subtract the daily provisional payment rate under step 1 from the notional rate under step 2. The difference is the rate of DFISA on that day.

    * _DFISA rate where primary payment is compensation affected but not prescribed_

    * _	(2)	The rate of DFISA on a day that is on or after 20 September 2004 is worked out using method statement 2 in this subsection if:

     * (a) Part 3.14 of the Social Security Act (compensation recovery) applies to reduce the rate of the primary payment on that day; and

     * (b) the primary payment is not a social security pension or social security benefit that is prescribed for the purposes of this section.

      * Note: For **_primary payment_** see section 118NB.

    * _Method Statement 2_

      * Step 1_.	Work out the daily provisional payment rate for the primary payment on that day.

         * Note: For **_daily provisional payment rate _**see subsection (4).

      * _Step 2_.	Work out the amount by which Part 3.14 of the Social Security Act reduces the daily primary payment rate on that day.

      * _Step 3_.	Subtract the amount in step 2 from the rate in step 1.

      * _Step 4_.	Work out what would have been the daily provisional payment rate (the **_notional rate_**) for the primary payment on that day if the 2 assumptions referred to in step 2 of method statement 1 in subsection (1) were made.

      * _Step 5_.	Work out the amount by which Part 3.14 of the Social Security Act would have reduced the notional rate on that day if that rate had been the daily primary payment rate.

      * _Step 6_.	Subtract the amount in step 5 from the rate in step 4.

      * _Step 7_.	Subtract the amount in step 3 from the amount in step 6. The difference is the rate of DFISA on that day.

    * _Regulations may prescribe other ways of calculating rate of DFISA_

    * _	(3)	The regulations may prescribe a social security pension or social security benefit for the purposes of this section. If the regulations do so, the regulations must also prescribe the method to work out the daily rate of DFISA that is payable in relation to that pension or benefit.

      * Note: For **_social security pension_** and **_social security benefit_** see section 5Q.

    * _Definitions_

    * _	(4)	In this section:

    * **_daily provisional payment rate_** means the provisional payment rate, provisional annual payment rate or provisional fortnightly payment rate referred to in the Rate Calculator used under the Social Security Act to work out the rate of the primary payment, converted to a daily rate by dividing the rate by 364 (for a provisional annual payment rate) or 14 (for a provisional fortnightly payment rate).

    * **_rent assistance_** has the same meaning as in the Social Security Act.

    * **_rent reduction amount_** is the amount that would be a person's income reduction under the Social Security Act if that income reduction were worked out by applying the same income test or ordinary income test that was used under that Act in calculating the person's primary payment, but applying that test on the basis that the adjusted disability pension payable to the person, or the person's partner, were the person's only ordinary income for the purposes of that Act.

##### Subdivision C--Special rules for the Social Security Act

##### 118ND  Bereavement payments under the Social Security Act

    * _Increase of bereavement payments to take account of DFISA_

     * (a) a social security pension or social security benefit was payable to the person; and

     * (b) DFISA was payable to the person;

    * then, for the purposes of the bereavement payment provisions of the Social Security Act, the rate of the pension or benefit that, if the person had not died, would have been payable to the person on a day during the bereavement period is increased by the rate of DFISA that would also have been payable to the person on that day.

      * Note 1: For **_social security pension_** and **_social security benefit_** see section 5Q.

     * (c) the Social Security Secretary is not satisfied that the person has not had the benefit of the DFISA amount;

    * the following provisions have effect:
