    * the person is, for the purposes of this Act, taken to receive one fiftysecond of that amount as ordinary income of the person during each week in the 12 months commencing on the day on which the person becomes entitled to receive that amount.

#### Division 1A--Work bonus

##### 46AA  Income concession

    * (1) This section applies to a person if:

     * (a) the person's rate of service pension or income support supplement is calculated in accordance with the Rate Calculator; and

     * (b) the person has reached qualifying age.

        * Note: For **_qualifying age_** see section 5Q.

    * Employment income greater than or equal to income concession amount

    * (2) If the person's employment income for a pension period is greater than or equal to the income concession amount for that period, then, for the purposes of Module E of that Rate Calculator, the amount of the person's employment income for that period is reduced by an amount equal to the income concession amount.

        * Note: For **_employment income_** see section 46AB.

        * Example 1: David earns $2,250 of employment income in a pension period. David's rate of service pension or income support supplement for that period is greater than nil.

        * David's employment income for that period is reduced by $250, leaving David $2,000 of employment income for that period.

        * Example 2: Amy earns $1,000 of employment income in a pension period. Amy's rate of service pension or income support supplement for that period is greater than nil.

        * Amy's employment income for that period is reduced by $250, leaving Amy $750 of employment income for that period.

    * (3) If the person's unused concession balance (see section 46AC) is greater than or equal to the amount (the **_current amount_**) of the person's employment income that remains after applying subsection (2) of this section in relation to a pension period:

     * (a) for the purposes of Module E of that Rate Calculator, the person's employment income for that period is further reduced to nil; and

     * (b) if the person's rate of service pension or income support supplement for that period is greater than nil--the person's unused concession balance is reduced by an amount equal to the current amount.

        * Example 1: To continue example 1 in subsection (2), assume David's unused concession balance is $2,000. The current amount is $2,000.

        * David's employment income for that period is further reduced to nil.

        * David's unused concession balance is now nil.

        * Example 2: To continue example 2 in subsection (2), assume Amy's unused concession balance is $1,600. The current amount is $750.

        * Amy's employment income for that period is further reduced to nil.

        * Amy's unused concession balance is now $850.

    * (4) If the person's unused concession balance (see section 46AC) is greater than nil but less than the amount of the person's employment income that remains after applying subsection (2) of this section in relation to a pension period:

     * (a) for the purposes of Module E of that Rate Calculator, the person's employment income for that period is further reduced by an amount equal to that unused concession balance; and

     * (b) if the person's rate of service pension or income support supplement for that period is greater than nil--the person's unused concession balance is reduced to nil.

        * Example: Bill earns $1,250 of employment income in a pension period. Bill's rate of service pension or income support supplement for that period is greater than nil.

        * Under subsection (2), Bill's employment income for that period is reduced by $250, leaving Bill $1,000 of employment income for that period.

        * Assume Bill's unused concession balance is $800.

        * Under subsection (4), Bill's employment income for that period is further reduced by $800 leaving Bill $200 of employment income for that period.

        * Bill's unused concession balance is now nil.

    * Employment income less than income concession amount

    * (4A) If the person has employment income for a pension period but that income is less than the income concession amount for that period:

     * (a) for the purposes of Module E of that Rate Calculator, the person's employment income for that period is reduced to nil; and

     * (b) if the person's rate of service pension or income support supplement for that period is greater than nil--the person's unused concession balance (see section 46AC) is increased, subject to subsection 46AC(2), by an amount equal to the difference between that income concession amount and that employment income (before it was reduced).

        * Note: For **_employment income_** see section 46AB.

        * Example: Emma earns $100 of employment income in a pension period. Emma's rate of service pension or income support supplement for that period is greater than nil.

        * Emma's employment income for that period is reduced to nil.

        * Emma's unused concession balance is increased by $150.

    * No employment income

    * (4B) If:

     * (a) the person has no employment income for a pension period; and

     * (b) the person's rate of service pension or income support supplement for that period is greater than nil;

    * the person's unused concession balance (see section 46AC) is increased, subject to subsection 46AC(2), by an amount equal to the income concession amount for that period.

        * Note: For **_employment income_** see section 46AB.

    * Definition

    * (4C) The **_income concession amount _**for a pension period is $250.

    * Interpretation

    * (5) If the person is a member of a couple, apply this section in relation to the person, and to the person's partner, before applying Point SCH6E3 of Schedule 6.

    * (5A) If:

     * (a) the person is a member of a couple; and

     * (b) the person's partner's employment income (within the meaning of the _Social Security Act 1991_) is reduced by one or more amounts (each of which is a **_reduction amount_**) under section 1073AA of that Act;

    * then, in applying point SCH6E3 of Schedule 6, the ordinary/adjusted income of the person's partner is to be reduced by an amount equal to the total of the reduction amounts.

    * (6) This section is subject to section 46AD (about no double income reductions under this section and section 115G).

##### 46AB  Meaning of employment income

    * (1) For the purposes of section 46AA, **_employment income_**, in relation to a person, is ordinary income of the person:

     * (a) that is earned, derived or received, or that is taken to have been earned, derived or received, by the person from remunerative work undertaken by the person as an employee in an employer/employee relationship; and

     * (b) that includes, but is not limited to:

      * (i) salary, wages, commissions and employmentrelated fringe benefits that are so earned, derived or received or taken to have been so earned, derived or received; and

      * (ii) if the person is engaged on a continuing basis in that employer/employee relationship--a leave payment to the person;

    * but does not include: 

     * (c) a superannuation payment to the person; or

     * (d) a payment of compensation, or a payment to the person under an insurance scheme, in relation to the person's inability to earn, derive or receive income from that remunerative work; or

     * (e) if the person is not engaged on a continuing basis in that employer/employee relationship--a leave payment to the person; or

     * (f) a payment to the person by a former employer of the person in relation to the termination of the person's employment; or

     * (g) a comparable foreign pension; or

     * (h) an instalment of parental leave pay; or

     * (i) dad and partner pay.

    * (2) For the purposes of subsection (1), a leave payment:

     * (a) includes a payment in respect of personal/carer's leave, annual leave, maternity leave or long service leave; and

     * (b) may be made as a lump sum payment, a payment that is one of a series of regular payments or otherwise; and

     * (c) is taken to be made to a person if it is made to another person:

      * (i) at the direction of the person or of a court; or

      * (ii) on behalf of the person; or

      * (iii) for the benefit of the person; or

      * (iv) if the person waives or assigns his or her right to the payment.

##### 46AC  Unused concession balance

    * Initial unused concession balance of nil

    * (1) A person has an unused concession balance of nil on the first day that is after 30 June 2011 and is a day on which section 46AA applies to the person.

    * Maximum unused concession balance

    * (2) If, apart from this subsection, the person's unused concession balance would exceed $6,500, that balance is instead taken to be $6,500.

        * Example: John has an unused concession balance of $6,400. John earns $50 of employment income in a pension period.

        * Instead of John's unused concession balance increasing to $6,600 under subsection 46AA(4A), John's unused concession balance increases to $6,500.

    * Effect of ceasing to receive service pension or income support supplement

    * (3) If the person ceases to receive service pension or income support supplement, the person retains the person's unused concession balance immediately before that cessation.

        * Note: If section 46AA applies to the person again, the person's unused concession balance will be that retained balance.

##### 46AD  No double income reductions under sections 46AA and 115G

    * Scope

    * (1) This section applies if, apart from this section:

     * (a) an amount (the **_initial amount_**) would be an excluded amount under subsection 115G(1) or (2) in respect of a veteran and a pension period; and

     * (b) the veteran's employment income would be reduced by one or more amounts (each of which is a **_reduction amount_**) under section 46AA in relation to that period.

    * Income reduction under section 46AA

    * (2) If the total of the reduction amounts is more than the initial amount:

     * (a) subsection 115G(1) or (2), as the case may be, does not apply in relation to that veteran and that period; and

     * (b) subsections 46AA(2) to (4A) do apply in relation to that veteran and that period.

    * Income reduction under section 115G

    * (3) If the total of the reduction amounts is less than or equal to the initial amount:

     * (a) subsections 46AA(2) to (4A) do not apply to reduce the veteran's employment income in relation to that period, but they do apply for the purposes of working out any adjustment to the veteran's unused concession balance in relation to that period (as if those reductions had occurred); and

     * (b) subsection 115G(1) or (2), as the case may be, does apply in relation to that veteran and that period.

        * Note: Subsections 115G(1) and (2) are about excluding income amounts for certain veterans.

        * Example: Jim earns $100 of employment income in a pension period. Jim's rate of service pension or income support supplement for that period is greater than nil. Assume Jim also has an amount of $100 worked out under subsection 115G(1) in relation to that period.

        * There is no reduction in Jim's employment income under section 46AA for that period, but $100 is excluded under subsection 115G(1).

        * Under subsection 46AA(4A), Jim's unused concession balance is increased by $150.

#### Division 2--Business income

##### 46B  Ordinary income from a business--treatment of trading stock

    * (1) If:

     * (a) a person carries on a business; and

     * (b) the value of all the trading stock on hand at the end of a tax year is greater than the value of all the trading stock on hand at the beginning of that tax year;

    * the person's ordinary income for that tax year in the form of profits from the business is to include the amount of the difference in values.

    * (2) If:

     * (a) a person carries on a business; and

     * (b) the value of all the trading stock on hand at the end of a tax year is less than the value of all the trading stock on hand at the beginning of that tax year;

    * the person's ordinary income for that tax year in the form of profits from the business is to be reduced by the amount of the difference in values.

        * Note: Different provisions apply when working out a person's ordinary income from a farm to find whether:

          * (a) the person satisfies the farmers' income test for the purposes of Division 8 (see subparagraph 49J(3)(b)(ii) and paragraph 49J(3)(e)); or

          * (b) the person satisfies the sugarcane farmers' income test for the purposes of Division 8A (see subparagraph 49Y(3)(b)(ii) and paragraph 49Y(3)(e)).

##### 46C  Permissible reductions of business income

    * (1) Subject to subsection (2), if a person carries on a business, the person's ordinary income from the business is to be reduced by:

     * (a) losses and outgoings that relate to the business and are allowable deductions for the purposes of section 81 of the _Income Tax Assessment Act 1997_; and

     * (ba) amounts that relate to the business and can be deducted for the decline in value of depreciating assets under Subdivision 40B of the _Income Tax Assessment Act 1997_; and

     * (c) amounts that relate to the business and are allowable deductions under section 29060 of the _Income Tax Assessment Act 1997_.

        * Note: Different provisions apply when working out a person's ordinary income from a farm to find whether:

          * (a) the person satisfies the farmers' income test for the purposes of Division 8 (see subparagraph 49J(3)(b)(ii) and paragraph 49J(3)(e)); or

          * (b) the person satisfies the sugarcane farmers' income test for the purposes of Division 8A (see subparagraph 49Y(3)(b)(ii) and paragraph 49Y(3)(e)).

    * (2) If, under Division 3, a person is taken to receive ordinary income on a financial investment, that ordinary income is not to be reduced by the amount of any expenses incurred by the person because of that investment.

        * Note: For **_financial investment _**see subsection 5J(1).

    * (3) If a person's ordinary income for a period includes rental income from a property that is not business income, the person's ordinary income from that property is to be reduced by losses and outgoings that relate to the property and are allowable deductions for the purposes of section 81 of the _Income Tax Assessment Act 1997_ for that period.

    * (4) If the amount of the allowable deductions relating to a property for a period under section 81 of the _Income Tax Assessment Act 1997_ exceeds the amount of the rental income from that property for that period, the amount of the ordinary income from the property for that period is taken to be nil.

#### Division 3--Income from financial assets (including income streams (short term) and certain income streams (long term))

##### 46D  Deemed income from financial assets--persons other than members of couples

    * (1) This section applies to a person who is not a member of a couple.

        * Note: The whole of Division 3 does not apply when working out a person's ordinary income to find whether:

          * (a) the person satisfies the farmers' income test for the purposes of Division 8 (see paragraphs 49J(2)(c) and (3)(c)); or

          * (b) the person satisfies the sugarcane farmers' income test for the purposes of Division 8A (see paragraphs 49Y(2)(c) and (3)(c)).

    * (2) A person who has financial assets is taken, for the purposes of this Act, to receive ordinary income on those assets in accordance with this section.

    * (3) This is how to work out the ordinary income that the person is taken to receive:

Method statement

      * Step 1.	Calculate the total value of the person's financial assets and compare it with the person's deeming threshold.

            * Note 1: For **_financial assets_** see subsection 5J(1).

            * Note 2: For **_deeming threshold_** see subsection 46H(1).

      * Step 2.	This step applies only if the total value of the person's financial assets is equal to or less than the person's deeming threshold. Multiply the total value of the financial assets by the below threshold rate. The result represents the ordinary income that the person is taken to receive per year on his or her financial assets.

            * Note: For **_below threshold rate_** see subsection 46J(1).

      * Step 3.	This step applies only if the total value of the person's financial assets is higher than the person's deeming threshold. Work out the person's deemed income as follows:

        * (a) multiply the deeming threshold by the below threshold rate;

        * (b) subtract the deeming threshold from the total value of the person's financial assets;

        * (c) multiply the remainder by the above threshold rate;

            * Note: For **_above threshold rate_** see subsection 46J(2).

        * (d) add up the amounts worked out at paragraph (a) and (c): the result represents the ordinary income that the person is taken to receive per year on his or her financial assets.

        * Example: How deemed income of a person who is not a member of a couple is worked out

        * Facts: Elaine, a single pensioner, has $36,500 worth of financial assets. $1,500 is in a cheque account not earning any interest. $25,000 is earning 6% in interest and $10,000 is earning 8% in interest. The below threshold rate is 5%. The above threshold rate is 7%.

        * Result: 

        * Step 1.	The total value of Elaine's financial assets ($36,500) is higher than her deeming threshold ($30,000--see subsection 46H(1)). So, the deeming threshold is multiplied by the below threshold rate:

        * Step 2.	Elaine's deeming threshold of $30,000 is subtracted from the total value of her financial assets ($36,500). The remainder is $6,500.

        * Step 3.	The amount of $6,500 is multiplied by the above threshold rate (7%):

        * Step 4.	The amounts worked out at Steps 1 and 3 are added together:

        * The ordinary income that Elaine is deemed to receive from her financial assets is $1,955 per year.

    * (4) The person is taken, for the purposes of this Act, to receive one fiftysecond of the amount calculated under subsection (3) as ordinary income of the person during each week.

##### 46E  Deemed income from financial assets--members of a couple

    * (1) This section applies to the members of a couple.

        * Note: The whole of Division 3 does not apply when working out a person's ordinary income to find whether:

          * (a) the person satisfies the farmers' income test for the purposes of Division 8 (see paragraphs 49J(2)(c) and (3)(c)); or

          * (b) the person satisfies the sugarcane farmers' income test for the purposes of Division 8A (see paragraphs 49Y(2)(c) and (3)(c)).

    * (2) If one or both of the members of a couple have financial assets, the members of the couple are taken, for the purposes of this Act, to receive together ordinary income on those assets in accordance with this section.

    * (3) This is how to work out the ordinary income that the couple is taken to receive:

Method statement

      * Step 1.	Calculate the total value of the couple's financial assets and compare it with the couple's deeming threshold.

            * Note 1: For **_financial assets_** see subsection 5J(1).

            * Note 2: For **_deeming threshold_** see subsection 46H(2).

      * Step 2.	This step applies only if the total value of the couple's financial assets is equal to or less than the couple's deeming threshold. Multiply the total value of the financial assets by the below threshold rate. The result represents the ordinary income that the couple is taken to receive per year on their financial assets.

            * Note: For **_below threshold rate_** see subsection 46J(1).

      * Step 3.	This step applies only if the total value of the couple's financial assets is higher than the couple's deeming threshold. Work out the couple's deemed income as follows:

        * (a) multiply the deeming threshold by the below threshold rate;

        * (b) subtract the deeming threshold from the total value of the couple's assets;

        * (c) multiply the remainder by the above threshold rate;

            * Note: For **_above threshold rate_** see subsection 46J(2).

        * (d) add up the amounts worked out at paragraph (a) and (c): the result represents the ordinary income that the couple is taken to receive per year on their financial assets.

        * Example: How deemed income of a couple is worked out

        * Facts: Maree and Peter, a couple, have $68,500 worth of financial assets. They have $3,500 in a savings account earning interest at 2.8% and deposits of $25,000 and $40,000 earning 5% p.a. and 8% p.a. in interest respectively. The below threshold rate is 5%. The above threshold rate is 7%.

        * Result: 

        * Step 1.	The total value of the couple's financial assets ($68,500) is higher than their deeming threshold ($50,000--see subsection 46H(2)). So, the deeming threshold is multiplied by the below threshold rate:

        * Step 2.	The couple's deeming threshold of $50,000 is subtracted from the total value of their financial assets ($68,500). The remainder is $18,500.

        * Step 3.	The amount of $18,500 is multiplied by the above threshold rate (7%):

        * Step 4.	The amounts worked out at Steps 1 and 3 are added together:

        * The ordinary income that the couple is deemed to receive from their financial assets is $3,795 per year.

    * (4) Each member of the couple is taken, for the purposes of this Act, to receive, as ordinary income during each week, an amount calculated according to the formula:

##### 46H  Deeming threshold

    * (1) The deeming threshold for a person who is not a member of a couple is $30,000.

    * (2) The deeming threshold for a couple is $50,000.

        * Note: The amounts fixed by subsections (1) and (2) are indexed every 1 July. See sections 59A to 59C.

##### 46J  Below threshold rate, above threshold rate

    * (1) For the purposes of this Division, the below threshold rate is the rate that is the below threshold rate for the purposes of Division 1B of Part 3.10 of the Social Security Act.

    * (2) For the purposes of this Division, the above threshold rate is the rate that is the above threshold rate for the purposes of Division 1B of Part 3.10 of the Social Security Act.

##### 46K  Actual return on financial assets not treated as ordinary income

    * (1) Subject to subsection (2), any return on a financial asset that a person actually earns, derives or receives is taken, for the purposes of this Act, not to be ordinary income of the person.

        * Note: When working out a person's ordinary income to find whether the person satisfies the farmers' income test for the purposes of Division 8 or the sugarcane farmers' income test for the purposes of Division 8A, actual returns on financial assets are taken to be ordinary income (see paragraphs 49J(2)(d) and (3)(d) and 49Y(2)(d) and (3)(d)).

    * (2) If, because of:

     * (a) a determination under subsection 46L(1); or

     * (b) the operation of subsection 46L(1A);

    * a financial investment is not to be regarded as a financial asset for the purposes of section 46D or 46E, subsection (1) of this section does not apply to any return on the investment that the person actually earns, derives or receives.

##### 46L  Certain money and financial investments not taken into account

    * (1) The Minister may determine that:

     * (a) specified financial investments; or

     * (b) a specified class of financial investments;

    * are not to be regarded as financial assets for the purposes of section 46D or 46E.

    * (1A) If the Commission makes a determination under section 52Y in relation to a person, any unrealisable asset of the person or the person's partner is not regarded as a financial asset for the purposes of section 46D or 46E.

    * (3) A determination under subsection (1) must be in writing.

    * (4) A determination under subsection (1) takes effect on the day on which it is made or on such other day (whether earlier or later) as is specified in the determination.

##### 46M  Valuation and revaluation of certain financial investments

    * The total value of a person's listed securities and managed investments (being listed securities and managed investments that fluctuate depending on the market) (the **_relevant investments_**) is determined in accordance with the following:

     * (a) an initial total valuation is to be given to the relevant investments on 1 July 1996, or when a new claim is determined, by the method set out in departmental guidelines;

     * (b) that total valuation continues in effect until the relevant investments are revalued by the method set out in departmental guidelines, and that revaluation must occur:

      * (i) on 20 March in each calendar year after 1996; and

      * (ii) on 20 September in each calendar year after 1996; and

      * (iii) when the person requests a revaluation of one or more of the person's listed securities and managed investments; and

      * (iv) following an event that affects the relevant investments and is the subject of a recipient notification notice.

#### Division 4--Income from income streams not covered by Division 3

##### Subdivision B--Income streams that are not family law affected income streams

##### 46SA  Scope of Subdivision

    * (1) This Subdivision applies to income streams that are not family law affected income streams.

    * (2) However, this Subdivision does not apply to:

     * (a) an assettested income stream (long term) that is an accountbased pension within the meaning of the _Superannuation Industry (Supervision) Regulations 1994_; or

     * (b) an assettested income stream (long term) that is an annuity (within the meaning of the _Superannuation Industry (Supervision) Act 1993_) provided under a contract that meets the requirements determined in an instrument under subsection 5J(1G) of this Act.

        * Note 1: For treatment of an income stream mentioned in subsection (2), see Division 3.

        * Note 2: Part 2 of Schedule 11 to the _Social Services and Other Legislation Amendment Act 2014_ preserves the rules in this Subdivision for a certain kind of income stream that was being provided to a person immediately before 1 January 2015 where the person was receiving an income support payment immediately before that day provided that, since that day, that income stream has been provided to the person and the person has been continuously receiving an income support payment.

##### 46T  Income from assettest exempt income stream

    * (1) For the purpose of working out the annual rate of ordinary income of a person from an assettest exempt income stream to which this Subdivision applies, the person is taken to receive from that income stream each year the amount worked out under section 46U or 46V.

        * Note: For **_assettest exempt income stream_** see sections 5JA, 5JB and 5JBA.

    * (2) Sections 46U and 46V do not apply if:

     * (a) the income stream is covered by subsection 5JBA(1); or

     * (b) on the income stream's commencement day, there was a reasonable likelihood that the income stream would have been covered by subsection 5JBA(1), but the income stream is no longer covered by that subsection.

        * Note: See section 46VA.

     * (b) if, immediately before the transfer by the person of his or her qualifying interest in the farm or relevant farm asset, the transferee had a qualifying interest in the farm or relevant farm asset--the **_value for the purposes of this section_** of the farm or relevant farm asset is its value when the transfer is completed less the value of the transferee's qualifying interest in it at that time.

    * (5) For the purposes of paragraphs (1)(d) and (2)(d), a person is taken to have been **_actively involved with a farm _**during a particular period if, during that period, the person:

    * (1) If:

     * (a) a transfer of a kind referred to in paragraph 49A(1)(a) or (2)(a) is completed after 14 September 1997; and

     * (b) at any time before the transfer but after 14 September 1997, the person making the transfer entered into a transaction or transactions as a result of which:

      * (i) the value of the farm or farms in which the person had a qualifying interest immediately before the transfer is less than the value that that farm or those farms would have had immediately before the transfer if the person had not entered into the transaction or transactions (the **_unreduced farm value_**); or

      * (ii) the value of the relevant farm assets in which the person had a qualifying interest immediately before the transfer is less than the value that those relevant farm assets would have had immediately before the transfer if the person had not entered into the transaction or transactions (the **_unreduced assets value_**);

    * then, for the purposes of section 49A:

     * (c) the value of that farm or those farms is taken to be an amount equal to the unreduced farm value; and

     * (d) the value of those relevant farm assets is taken to be an amount equal to the unreduced assets value.

    * Life interest retained in principal home on farm

    * (2) If, when transferring by way of gift to another person his or her qualifying interest in a farm, a person retains a freehold estate, a leasehold interest or a life interest in the dwellinghouse on the farm, and any adjacent area of land used primarily for private or domestic purposes in association with that dwellinghouse, that constitute the person's principal home, then, for the purposes of section 49A:

     * (a) the person is taken to have transferred the whole of his or her qualifying interest in the farm by way of gift; but

     * (b) when assessing the value of the farm, the value of the dwellinghouse and any adjacent area of land used primarily for private or domestic purposes in association with that dwellinghouse is not to be included.

##### Subdivision 5--Farmers' income test

##### 49J  Does a person satisfy the farmers' income test?

    * How to work out whether the farmers' income test is satisfied

    * (1) This is how to work out whether a person who has transferred his or her qualifying interest in a farm or farms satisfies the farmers' income test for the purposes of this Division:

Method statement

      * Step 1.	Work out under subsection (2) the amount of the person's ordinary income (other than ordinary income from farming) for each of the last 3 financial years before the applicable completion day (the **_income test years_**).

      * If the person was a member of a couple on the applicable completion day, work out also under subsection (2) the amount of his or her partner's ordinary income (other than ordinary income from farming) for the 3 income test years.

      * Add up all the amounts so obtained. The result is called the person's **_total nonfarm income_**.

      * Step 2.	Work out under subsection (3) the amount of the person's ordinary income from farming for each of the 3 income test years.

      * If the person was a member of a couple on the applicable completion day, work out also under subsection (3) the amount of his or her partner's ordinary income from farming for the 3 income test years.

      * Add up all the amounts of positive income for both the person and the person's partner and deduct from that total the amounts of negative income (if any) for both the person and the person's partner. The result is called the person's **_total farm income_** (which may be either positive or negative).

      * Step 3.	Work out the person's **_total income for the 3 income test years_**:

        * (a) if the person's total farm income is a positive amount--by adding that amount to the amount of the person's total nonfarm income; or

        * (b) if the person's total farm income is a negative amount--by deducting that amount from the amount of the person's total nonfarm income.

      * Step 4.	Work out under subsection (4) the maximum basic rate for age service pension applicable to the person. Multiply that rate by 3. The result is called the person's **_maximum basic entitlement_**.

      * Step 5.	If the person's total income for the 3 income test years is less than the person's maximum basic entitlement, the person satisfies the farmers' income test for the purposes of this Division.

      * If the person's total income for the 3 income test years equals or exceeds the person's maximum basic entitlement, the person does not satisfy the farmers' income test for the purposes of this Division.

    * Person's ordinary income from all sources other than farming

    * (2) For the purpose of working out a person's ordinary income from all sources other than farming during a financial year, the following provisions have effect:

     * (a) Divisions 1, 4, 6 and 7 of this Part apply to the person;

     * (b) Division 2 of this Part applies to the person as if any reference in that Division to a tax year were a reference to that financial year;

     * (c) Division 3 of this Part does not apply to the person;

     * (d) any return on a financial asset that the person has actually received during the financial year is taken to be ordinary income of the person.

    * Person's ordinary income from farming

    * (3) For the purpose of working out a person's ordinary income from farming during a financial year, the following provisions have effect:

     * (a) Divisions 1, 4, 6 and 7 of this Part apply to the person;

     * (b) Division 2 of this Part applies to the person as if:

      * (i) any reference in subsection 46B(1) to a tax year were a reference to that financial year; and

      * (ii) subsection 46B(2) and section 46C were omitted;

     * (c) Division 3 of this Part does not apply to the person;

     * (d) any return on a financial asset that the person has actually received during the financial year and that relates to a farm or a relevant farm asset is taken to be ordinary income of the person from farming;

     * (e) if, at the end of the financial year, the value of all trading stock on hand that relates to a farm is less than the value of all such trading stock on hand at the beginning of that financial year--the amount of the difference is to be deducted from that part of the person's ordinary income from farming for that financial year that is income in the form of profits;

     * (f) there is also to be deducted from the person's ordinary income from farming:

      * (i) losses and outgoings that relate to a farm and are allowable deductions for the purposes of section 81 of the _Income Tax Assessment Act 1997_; and

      * (iia) amounts that relate to a relevant farm asset and can be deducted for the decline in value of the asset under Subdivision 40B of the _Income Tax Assessment Act 1997_; and

      * (iii) amounts that relate to a farm or a relevant farm asset and are allowable deductions under subsection 82AAC(1) of the _Income Tax Assessment Act 1936_;

     * (g) if a negative result is obtained after applying paragraphs (e) and (f)--the person's ordinary income from farming for the financial year is a negative income;

     * (h) if paragraph (g) does not apply--the person's ordinary income from farming for the financial year is a positive income.

    * Person's maximum basic rate for age service pension

    * (4) For the purposes of Step 4 in the Method statement in subsection (1), the maximum basic rate for age service pension applicable to the person is:

     * (a) if the person was a member of a couple at any time during the 3 years immediately before the operative day--the sum of:

      * (i) an amount equal to twice the amount that was, on the operative day, the maximum basic rate for a partnered person under point SCH6B1; and

      * (ii) an amount equal to twice the pension supplement under Module BA in Schedule 6; or

     * (b) otherwise--the sum of:

      * (i) the amount that was, on the operative day, the maximum basic rate for a person who is not a member of a couple under point SCH6B1; and

      * (ii) the pension supplement under Module BA in Schedule 6.

     * (b) immediately after the transfer to the eligible descendant, or eligible descendants, referred to in paragraph (1)(a) or (2)(a) (as the case may be), the eligible interest, or any part of the eligible interest, transferred was held by a trust that was a concessional primary production trust in relation to the transferor.

        * Note 1: For **_eligible descendant_** see subsection 5P(1).

        * Note 2: For **_eligible interest_**, **_relevant sugarcane farm asset_** and **_sugarcane farm_** see subsection 5PAA(1).

##### 49R  How to assess the total net value of sugarcane farms etc. subject to a transfer

    * Meaning of **total net value**

    * **	(1)	For the purposes of subsections 49Q(1) and (2), the **_total net value_** of a sugarcane farm, or sugarcane farms, and relevant sugarcane farm assets, the eligible interests in which have been transferred, is to be calculated as follows:

    * where: 

    * **_market value of sugarcane farm assets_** means the total of the market values of the sugarcane farm, or sugarcane farms, and relevant sugarcane farm assets immediately before the transfer of the eligible interests.

    * **_sugarcane farm debts_** means the total of any amounts of money that:

     * (a) had been borrowed for the purposes of undertaking one or more sugarcane farm enterprises on the sugarcane farm or sugarcane farms; and

     * (b) had not been repaid before the transfer of the eligible interests.

        * Note: The total net value of a sugarcane farm, or sugarcane farms, and relevant sugarcane farm assets is not affected by the number of persons who have interests in them.

    * (2) Subsection (1) has effect subject to subsections (3), (4) and (5).

    * Value of farm reduced by value of transferee's interest

    * (3) If:

     * (a) a person transfers eligible interests that the person has in a sugarcane farm, or sugarcane farms, and relevant sugarcane farm assets; and

     * (b) immediately before the transfer by the person of his or her eligible interests in the farm, or farms, and relevant farm assets, the transferee had an eligible interest in the farm, or one of those farms, or a relevant farm asset;

    * then, the **_total net value_** of the farm, or farms, and relevant farm assets is the amount worked out under subsection (1) reduced by the value of the transferee's eligible interest in the farm or relevant farm asset at that time.

    * Value of farm affected by previous transaction

    * (4) If:

     * (a) a person transfers his or her eligible interests in a sugarcane farm, or sugarcane farms, and relevant sugarcane farm assets; and

     * (b) at any time after 29 April 2004 the person making the transfer entered into a transaction or transactions; and

     * (c) the result of the transaction or transactions was that the total net value (worked out in accordance with subsection (1)) of the farm, or farms, and relevant farm assets immediately before the transfer is less than the total net value that that farm, or those farms, and relevant farm assets would have had immediately before the transfer if the person had not entered into the transaction or transactions (the **_unreduced value_**);

    * then, the **_total net value_** of the farm, or farms, and relevant farm assets is taken to be an amount equal to the unreduced value.

    * Life interest retained in principal home on farm

    * (5) If:

     * (a) a person transfers eligible interests that the person has in a farm by way of gift; and

     * (b) the person retains a freehold estate, a leasehold interest or a life interest in the dwellinghouse on the farm, and any adjacent area of land used primarily for private or domestic purposes in association with that dwellinghouse, that constitute the person's principal home;

    * then: 

     * (c) for the purposes of subsections 49Q(1) and (2), the person is taken to have transferred the whole of his or her eligible interest in the farm by way of gift; and

     * (d) in assessing the market value of the farm for the purposes of subsection (1), the value of the dwellinghouse and any adjacent area of land used primarily for private or domestic purposes in association with that dwellinghouse is not to be included.

        * Note: For **_eligible interest, relevant sugarcane farm asset_**, **_sugarcane farm_** and **_transfer _**see subsection 5PAA(1).

##### Subdivision E--Sugarcane farmers' income test

##### 49Y  Does a person satisfy the sugarcane farmers' income test?

    * How to work out whether the sugarcane farmers' income test is satisfied

    * (1) This is how to work out whether a person who has transferred his or her eligible interest in a sugarcane farm or sugarcane farms satisfies the sugarcane farmers' income test for the purposes of this Division:

Method statement

      * Step 1.	Work out under subsection (2) the amount of the person's ordinary income (other than ordinary income from farming) for each of the last 3 financial years before the applicable completion day (the **_income test years_**).

      * If the person was a member of a couple on the applicable completion day, work out also under subsection (2) the amount of his or her partner's ordinary income (other than ordinary income from farming) for the 3 income test years.

      * Add up all the amounts so obtained. The result is called the person's **_total nonfarm income_**.

      * Step 2.	Work out under subsection (3) the amount of the person's ordinary income from farming for each of the 3 income test years.

      * If the person was a member of a couple on the applicable completion day, work out also under subsection (3) the amount of his or her partner's ordinary income from farming for the 3 income test years.

      * Add up all the amounts of positive income for both the person and the person's partner and deduct from that total the amounts of negative income (if any) for both the person and the person's partner. The result is called the person's **_total farm income_** (which may be either positive or negative).

      * Step 3.	Work out the person's **_total income for the 3 income test years_**:

        * (a) if the person's total farm income is a positive amount--by adding that amount to the amount of the person's total nonfarm income; or

        * (b) if the person's total farm income is a negative amount--by deducting that amount from the amount of the person's total nonfarm income.

      * Step 4.	Work out under subsection (4) the maximum basic rate for age service pension applicable to the person. Multiply that rate by 3. The result is called the person's **_maximum basic entitlement_**.

      * Step 5.	If the person's total income for the 3 income test years is less than the person's maximum basic entitlement, the person satisfies the sugarcane farmers' income test for the purposes of this Division.

      * If the person's total income for the 3 income test years equals or exceeds the person's maximum basic entitlement, the person does not satisfy the sugarcane farmers' income test for the purposes of this Division.

    * Person's ordinary income from all sources other than farming

    * (2) For the purpose of working out a person's ordinary income from all sources other than farming during a financial year, the following provisions have effect:

     * (a) Divisions 1, 4, 6 and 7 of this Part apply to the person;

     * (b) Division 2 of this Part applies to the person as if any reference in that Division to a tax year were a reference to that financial year;

     * (c) Division 3 of this Part does not apply to the person;

     * (d) any return on a financial asset that the person has actually received during the financial year is taken to be ordinary income of the person.

    * Person's ordinary income from farming

    * (3) For the purpose of working out a person's ordinary income from farming during a financial year, the following provisions have effect:

     * (a) Divisions 1, 4, 6 and 7 of this Part apply to the person;

     * (b) Division 2 of this Part applies to the person as if:

      * (i) any reference in subsection 46B(1) to a tax year were a reference to that financial year; and

      * (ii) subsection 46B(2) and section 46C were omitted;

     * (c) Division 3 of this Part does not apply to the person;

     * (d) any return on a financial asset that the person has actually received during the financial year and that relates to a farm or a relevant farm asset is taken to be ordinary income of the person from farming;

     * (e) if, at the end of the financial year, the value of all trading stock on hand that relates to a farm is less than the value of all such trading stock on hand at the beginning of that financial year--the amount of the difference is to be deducted from that part of the person's ordinary income from farming for that financial year that is income in the form of profits;

     * (f) there is also to be deducted from the person's ordinary income from farming:

      * (i) losses and outgoings that relate to a business of primary production and are allowable deductions under section 81 of the _Income Tax Assessment Act 1997_; and

      * (ii) deductions for the cost of depreciating assets that are used in a business of primary production and are allowable deductions under Subdivisions 40A to 40E (inclusive), or Division 328, of the _Income Tax Assessment Act 1997_; and

      * (iii) contributions that are allowable deductions under section 29060 of the _Income Tax Assessment Act 1997_;

     * (g) if a negative result is obtained after applying paragraphs (e) and (f)--the person's ordinary income from farming for the financial year is a negative income;

     * (h) if paragraph (g) does not apply--the person's ordinary income from farming for the financial year is a positive income.

    * Person's maximum basic rate for age service pension

    * (4) For the purposes of Step 4 in the Method statement in subsection (1), the maximum basic rate for age service pension applicable to the person is:

     * (a) if the person was a member of a couple at any time during the 3 years immediately before the applicable completion day--the sum of:

      * (i) an amount equal to twice the amount that was, on the applicable completion day, the maximum basic rate for a partnered person under point SCH6B1; and

      * (ii) an amount equal to twice the pension supplement under Module BA in Schedule 6; or

     * (b) otherwise--the sum of:

      * (i) the amount that was, on the applicable completion day, the maximum basic rate for a person who is not a member of a couple under point SCH6B1; and

      * (ii) the pension supplement under Module BA in Schedule 6.

    * Definitions

    * (5) In this section:

    * **_applicable completion day_**, in relation to a transfer, means the earlier of:

     * (a) the day on which the transfer was completed; and

     * (b) the RASF closing day.

     * (a) the sugarcane farm, or sugarcane farms, and any relevant sugarcane farm assets; and

     * (b) any other farm, or farms, or relevant farm assets in which the person has an interest.

     * (b) the person makes a request to participate under section 52ZD; and

     * (d) the Commission is satisfied that the amount of any debt that becomes payable by the person to the Commonwealth under this Subdivision is readily recoverable;

        * Note: For **_maximum payment rate _**see subsection 52ZAAA(1).

    * (2) The pension at the rate payable by operation of the scheme is payable on and from the day on which the request is lodged.

    * (3) For the purposes of section 53A (fringe benefits), if but for the operation of the scheme the person would not have received a service pension or income support supplement, the person is to be taken to be a person who is not receiving a service pension or income support supplement.

##### 52ZC  Effect of participation in pension loans scheme--creation of debt

    * (1) If the rate of the pension payable by operation of the pension loans scheme is more than the rate that would have been received by the person but for the operation of the scheme, the person owes a debt to the Commonwealth.

    * (3) This is how to work out the amount of the debt owed by the person from time to time:

Method statement

      * Step 1.	Work out the sum of the amount of pension received by the person from time to time under the pension loans scheme: the result is the **_primary loan amount_**.

      * Step 2.	Take away from the primary loan amount the sum of the amount of pension (if any) that would have been received by the person but for the operation of the scheme: the result is the **_basic amount of debt_**.

      * Step 3.	Add to the basic amount of debt the amount of interest payable. The interest payable is compound interest at the rate fixed under subsection (4) and compounding fortnightly: the result is the **_amount of debt including interest_**.

      * Step 4.	Add to the amount of debt including interest the amount of any registration costs payable by the person under subsection 52ZL(4): the result is the **_total amount of debt_**.

      * Step 5.	From the total amount of debt take away any amount of the debt already paid to the Commonwealth: the result is the current amount of debt owed by the person.

    * (4) The rate at which compound interest is payable under subsection (3) is the rate fixed from time to time, by legislative instrument, by the Minister administering the Social Security Act.

##### 52ZCA  Effect of participation in pension loans scheme--maximum loan available

    * (1) The maximum loan available to a person under the pension loans scheme is the amount worked out using the formula:

    * where:

     * (b) undergoing psychiatric confinement because the person has been charged with an offence.

        * Note: While an instalment is not payable to a person, the person is not entitled to benefits under Division 12 because the person is not **_receiving a service pension or income support supplement_** unless a determination is in force under subsection 53D(3), 55A(1) or 85(8).

    * Pensions generally payable fortnightly

    * (3) Unless subsection (3A) applies to the person, an instalment of pension is payable to a person on the next payday after the end of the pension period to which the instalment relates.

    * Pensions may be payable weekly

    * (3A) The Commission may determine, in writing, that the total amount of an instalment of pension payable to a person in relation to a pension period is payable to the person in 2 payments (the **_part payments_**) if the person is a member of a class specified under subsection (3C).

##### 59A  Indexed and adjusted amounts

    * The following Table sets out: 

     * (a) each amount that is to be indexed or adjusted under this Division; and

     * (b) the abbreviation used in this Division for referring to that amount; and

     * (c) the provision or provisions in which that amount is to be found.

        * Note 1: Indexing the PS minimum rate will also result in the indexation of the rate of quarterly pension supplement (see section 60B) and the rate of seniors supplement (see section 118PB).

        * Note 2: Indexing clean energy pension rate will also result in the indexation of seniors supplement (see section 118PB).

##### Subdivision B--CPI indexation

##### 59B  CPI Indexation Table

    * (1) Subject to subsection (1A), an amount referred to in the following CPI Indexation Table is to be indexed under this Division on each indexation day for the amount, using the reference quarter and base quarter for the amount and indexation day and rounding off to the nearest multiple of the rounding amount:

    * (1A) The pension MBR amount (item 1 of table) is not to be indexed on 20 March 1993.

    * Highest quarter

    * (2) A reference in the CPI Indexation Table to the highest of a group of quarters is a reference to the quarter in that group that has the highest index number.

##### 59C  Indexation of amounts

    * (1) If an amount is to be indexed under this Subdivision on an indexation day, this Act has effect as if the indexed amount were substituted for that amount on that day.

    * (2) This is how to work out the indexed amount for an amount that is to be indexed under this Subdivision on an indexation day:

Method statement

      * Step 1.	Use section 59D to work out the indexation factor for the amount on the indexation day.

      * Step 2.	Work out the current figure for the amount immediately before the indexation day.

      * Step 3.	Multiply the current figure by the indexation factor: the result is the **_provisional indexed amount_**.

      * Step 5.	Use section 59E to round off the provisional indexed amount: subject to section 59EAA, the result is the **_indexed amount_**.

      * The indexed amount (including one replaced under section 59EAA) may be increased under section 59EA in certain cases.

        * Note 1: For **_current figure_** see subsection 5NA(1).

        * Note 2: On the indexation days following 19 March 2001, the indexation of amounts that were increased by 4% or 10% on 1 July 2000 may be affected by section 198H.

    * (2AB) The first indexation of amounts under items 1A, 1B and 1C of the CPI Indexation Table in subsection 59B(1) is to take place on 20 March 2010.

    * (2A) The first indexation of an amount under item 8A of the CPI Indexation Table in subsection 59B(1) is to take place on 1 July 2007.

    * (3) The first indexation of amounts under items 11 and 12 of the CPI Indexation Table in subsection 59B(1) is to take place on 1 July 1997.

##### 59D  Indexation factor

    * (1) Subject to subsections (2) and (3) and section 198MA, the indexation factor for an amount that is to be indexed under this Subdivision on an indexation day is:

    * worked out to 3 decimal places.

        * Note: For **_reference quarter_** and **_base quarter_** see the CPI Indexation Table in section 59B.

    * (2) If an indexation factor worked out under subsection (1) would, if it were worked out to 4 decimal places, end in a number that is greater than 4, the indexation factor is to be increased by 0.001.

    * (3) If an indexation factor worked out under subsections (1) and (2) would be less than 1, the indexation factor is to be increased to 1.

##### 59E  Rounding off indexed amounts

    * (1) If a provisional indexed amount is a multiple of the rounding base, the provisional indexed amount becomes the indexed amount.

        * Note 1: For provisional indexed amount see step 3 in subsection 59C(2).

        * Note 2: For rounding base see the CPI Indexation Table in section 59B.

    * (2) If a provisional indexed amount is not a multiple of the rounding base, the indexed amount is the provisional indexed amount rounded up or down to the nearest multiple of the rounding base.

    * (3) If a provisional indexed amount is not a multiple of the rounding base but is a multiple of half the rounding base, the indexed amount is the provisional indexed amount rounded up to the nearest multiple of the rounding base.

##### 59EAA  Indexation using Pensioner and Beneficiary Living Cost Index

    * (1) This section applies to the pension MBR amount (see item 1 of the table in section 59A).

    * (2) If the indexed amount for the pension MBR amount, worked out under section 59C on an indexation day and disregarding section 59EA and this section, is less than the living cost amount worked out on that indexation day using the following method statement, then that indexed amount is taken to be an amount equal to that living cost amount:

Method statement

      * Step 1.	Use section 59EAB to work out the living cost indexation factor on that indexation day.

      * Step 2.	Work out the current figure for the pension MBR amount immediately before that indexation day.

            * Note: For **_current figure_** see subsection 5NA(1).

      * Step 3.	Multiply the current figure by the living cost indexation factor: the result is the **_provisional living cost amount_**.

      * Step 4.	Use section 59EAC to round off the provisional living cost amount: the result is the **_living cost amount_**.

        * Note: If the indexed amount for the pension MBR amount, worked out under section 59C, is taken to be an amount equal to that living cost amount, there may be a further increase of that replaced indexed amount under section 59EA.

##### 59EAB  Living cost indexation factor

    * (1) Subject to subsections (5) and (6) and section 198MB, the living cost indexation factor on an indexation day is:

    * worked out to 3 decimal places.

    * Definitions

    * (2) For the purposes of this section, the **_living cost index number_**, in relation to a quarter, is the All Groups Pensioner and Beneficiary Living Cost Index number that is the weighted average of the 8 capital cities and is published by the Australian Statistician in respect of that quarter.

    * (3) For the purposes of this section, the **_reference quarter_** is:

     * (a) if the indexation day is a 20 March--the most recent December quarter before the indexation day; and

     * (b) if the indexation day is a 20 September--the most recent June quarter before the indexation day.

    * (4) For the purposes of this section, the **_base quarter_** is the June or December quarter that:

     * (a) is a quarter before the reference quarter; and

     * (b) has the highest living cost index number.

    * Rounding

    * (5) If a living cost indexation factor worked out under subsection (1) would, if it were worked out to 4 decimal places, end in a number that is greater than 4, that indexation factor is to be increased by 0.001.

    * (6) If a living cost indexation factor worked out under subsections (1) and (5) would be less than 1, that indexation factor is to be increased to 1.

    * Publication of substituted living cost index numbers

    * (7) Subject to subsection (8), if at any time (whether before or after the commencement of this section) the Australian Statistician publishes a living cost index number for a quarter in substitution for a living cost index number previously published by the Australian Statistician for that quarter, the publication of the later living cost index number is to be disregarded for the purposes of this section.

    * Change to reference base

    * (8) If at any time (whether before or after the commencement of this section) the Australian Statistician changes the reference base for the Pensioner and Beneficiary Living Cost Index, regard is to be had, for the purposes of applying this section after the change takes place, only to living cost index numbers published in terms of the new reference base.

##### 59EAC  Rounding off amounts

    * (1) If a provisional living cost amount is a multiple of $2.60, the provisional living cost amount becomes the living cost amount.

    * (2) Subject to subsection (3), if a provisional living cost amount is not a multiple of $2.60, the living cost amount is the provisional living cost amount rounded up or down to the nearest multiple of $2.60.

    * (3) If a provisional living cost amount is not a multiple of $2.60 but is a multiple of $1.30, the living cost amount is the provisional living cost amount rounded up to the nearest multiple of $2.60.

##### 59EA  Certain indexed amounts to be increased in line with increases in Male Total Average Weekly Earnings

    * (1) In this section:

    * **_category B amount_** means an amount set out in column 3 of item 2 of Table B in point SCH6B1.

    * (2) If:

     * (a) a category B amount is to be indexed under this Subdivision on an indexation day; and

     * (b) 50% of the combined couple benchmark for that indexation day exceeds the indexed amount for the category B amount;

    * then: 

     * (c) the indexed amount for the category B amount is to be increased by an amount equal to the excess; and

     * (d) if the indexed amount for the category B amount (as increased under paragraph (c)) is not a multiple of $2.60, the indexed amount (as increased under paragraph (c)) is to be further increased by rounding up to the next highest multiple of $2.60.

    * (2A) For the purposes of this section, the **_combined couple benchmark_**, for an indexation day, is 41.76% of the annualised MTAWE figure for whichever of the following quarters is applicable:

     * (a) if the indexation day is a 20 March--the most recent December quarter;

     * (b) if the indexation day is a 20 September--the most recent June quarter.

    * (3) For the purposes of this section, the **_annualised MTAWE figure_** for a quarter is 52 times the amount set out for the reference period in the quarter under the headings "Average Weekly Earnings of Employees, Australia--Males--All males--Total earnings--ORIGINAL" in a document published by the Australian Statistician entitled "Average Weekly Earnings, States and Australia".

    * (4) If at any time (whether before or after the commencement of this section), the Australian Statistician publishes the amount referred to in subsection (3):

     * (a) under differently described headings (the **_new headings_**); or

     * (b) in a document entitled otherwise than as described in subsection (3) (the **_new document_**);

    * then the **_annualised MTAWE figure_** is to be calculated in accordance with subsection (3) as if the references to:

     * (c) "Average Weekly Earnings of Employees, Australia--Males--All males--Total earnings--ORIGINAL"; or

     * (d) "Average Weekly Earnings, States and Australia";

    * were references to the new headings and/or the new document, as the case requires.

    * (5) For the purposes of this section, the **_reference period_** in a particular quarter is the period described by the Australian Statistician as the pay period ending on or before a specified day that is the third Friday of the middle month of that quarter.

    * (6) If at any time (whether before or after the commencement of this section), the Australian Statistician publishes an amount in substitution for a particular amount previously published by the Australian Statistician, the publication of the later amount is to be disregarded for the purposes of this section.

    * (7) In this section:

    * **_December quarter_** means a quarter ending on 31 December.

    * **_June quarter_** means a quarter ending on 30 June.

##### Subdivision C--Adjustment of other rates

##### 59G  Adjustment of single pension rate MBR amount

    * (1) This Act has effect as if, on 20 March (an **_indexation day_**) and 20 September (an **_indexation day_**) each year, the adjusted single pension amount were substituted for the single pension rate MBR amount (see item 1A of the table in section 59A).

    * (2) For the purposes of this section, the adjusted single pension amount is worked out as follows:

Method statement

      * Step 1.	Work out the amount substituted for the pension MBR amount (see item 1 of the table in section 59A) on that indexation day under section 59C.

      * Step 2.	Multiply the amount worked out at step 1 by 2.

      * Step 3.	Work out 66.33% of the amount worked out at step 2.

      * Step 4.	Round the amount worked out at step 3 to the nearest multiple of $2.60 (rounding up if necessary): the result is the **_adjusted single pension amount_**.

##### 59GA  Adjustment of rent free area

    * (1) This Act has effect as if, on 1 July each year, the rent free area applicable to a person who is not a member of a couple were replaced with the amount that is, on that day, the pension free area applicable to a person who is not a member of a couple.

    * in accordance with this Act.

    * (2) Where:

     * (b) the death of the member was not defencecaused; and

     * (c) the member was, immediately before the member's death:

      * (i) a member to whom subsection 22(4) or section 23, 24 or 25 applied by virtue of section 73; or

      * (ii) a member to whom section 22 so applied who was in receipt of a pension the rate of which had been increased by reason that the pension was in respect of an incapacity described in item 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7 or 8 of the table in section 27;

    * the Commonwealth is, subject to this Act, liable to pay pensions by way of compensation to the dependants of the member.

    * (3) Where a pension in respect of the incapacity of a member of the Forces or of a member of a Peacekeeping Force from defencecaused injury or defencecaused disease, or both, is granted, after the death of the member, as from a date before the death of the member, subsection (2) applies as if the member had been in receipt of that pension immediately before the member died.

    * (4) For the purposes of this Act, the death of a member of a Peacekeeping Force shall be taken to have been defencecaused, an injury suffered by such a member shall be taken to be a defencecaused injury or a disease contracted by such a member shall be taken to be a defencecaused disease if the death, injury or disease, as the case may be, resulted from an occurrence that happened while the member was rendering peacekeeping service.

        * Note: After the MRCA commencement date, compensation is provided under the MRCA (instead of this Act) for some new defencecaused injuries, diseases and deaths: see section 70A.

    * (5) For the purposes of this Act, the death of a member of the Forces (other than a member to whom this Part applies solely because of section 69A) or member of a Peacekeeping Force shall be taken to have been defencecaused, an injury suffered by such a member shall be taken to be a defencecaused injury or a disease contracted by such a member shall be taken to be a defencecaused disease if:

     * (b) subject to subsection (8), the death, injury or disease, as the case may be, resulted from an accident that occurred while the member was travelling, during any defence service or peacekeeping service of the member but otherwise than in the course of duty, on a journey to a place for the purpose of performing duty or away from a place upon having ceased to perform duty; or

     * (c) the death is to be deemed by subsection (6) to be defencecaused, the injury is to be deemed by subsection (7) to be a defencecaused injury or the disease is to be deemed by subsection (7) to be a defencecaused disease, as the case may be; or

     * (d) the injury or disease from which the member died, or is incapacitated:

      * (i) was suffered or contracted during any defence service or peacekeeping service of the member, but did not arise out of that service; or

      * (ii) was suffered or contracted before the commencement of the period, or the last period, of defence service or peacekeeping service of the member, but not during such a period of service;

     * and, in the opinion of the Commission, the injury or disease was contributed to in a material degree by, or was aggravated by, any defence service or peacekeeping service rendered by the member, being service rendered after the member suffered that injury or contracted that disease; or

     * (e) the injury or disease from which the member died is an injury or disease that has been determined in accordance with this section other than this paragraph to have been a defencecaused injury or defencecaused disease, as the case may be;

          * Note: The effect of paragraph (e) is that, if the member has died from an injury or disease that has already been determined by the Commission to be defencecaused, the death is to be taken to have been defencecaused. Accordingly the Commission is not required to relate the death to defence service or peacekeeping service rendered by the member and sections 120A and 120B do not apply.

    * but not otherwise.

        * Note: After the MRCA commencement date, compensation is provided under the MRCA (instead of this Act) for some new defencecaused injuries, diseases and deaths: see section 70A.

    * (5A) If this Part applies to a member of the Forces solely because the member has rendered hazardous service as specified in section 69A, the death of the member is taken to be defencecaused, an injury suffered by such a member is taken to be a defencecaused injury or a disease contracted by such a member is taken to be a defencecaused disease if:

     * (a) the death, injury or disease, as the case may be, arose out of, or was attributable to, the hazardous service of the member; or

     * (b) subject to subsection (8), the death, injury or disease, as the case may be, resulted from an accident that occurred while the member was travelling, during any hazardous service but otherwise than in the course of duty, on a journey to a place for the purpose of performing duty or away from a place upon having ceased to perform duty; or

     * (c) the death is to be deemed by subsection (6) to be defencecaused, the injury is to be deemed by subsection (7) to be a defencecaused injury or the disease is to be deemed by subsection (7) to be a defencecaused disease, as the case may be; or

     * (d) the injury or disease from which the member died or is incapacitated:

      * (i) was suffered or contracted during any hazardous service of the member but did not arise out of that service; or

      * (ii) was suffered or contracted before the commencement of the hazardous service of the member but not during such a period of service;

     * (e) the injury or disease from which the member died is an injury or disease that has been determined in accordance with this section other than this paragraph to have been a defencecaused injury or defencecaused disease, as the case may be;

          * Note: The effect of paragraph (e) is that, if the member has died from an injury or disease that has already been determined by the Commission to be defencecaused, the death is to be taken to have been defencecaused. Accordingly the Commission is not required to relate the death to hazardous service rendered by the member and section 120A does not apply.

    * but not otherwise.

        * Note: After the MRCA commencement date, compensation is provided under the MRCA (instead of this Act) for some new defencecaused injuries, diseases and deaths: see section 70A.

    * (5B) If this Part applies to a member of the Forces solely because the member has rendered hazardous service as specified in section 69A, subsections (6) and (7) apply to the person as if references in those subsections to **_defence service or peacekeeping service, as the case may be_** were references to **_hazardous service_**.

    * (6) Where, in the opinion of the Commission, the death of a member of the Forces or member of a Peacekeeping Force was due to an accident that would not have occurred, or to a disease that would not have been contracted, but for his or her having rendered defence service or peacekeeping service, as the case may be, or but for changes in the member's environment consequent upon his or her having rendered any such service:

     * (a) the death of the member shall be deemed to have resulted from that defence service or peacekeeping service, as the case may be; and

     * (b) the death of the member shall be deemed to be defencecaused, for the purposes of this Act.

    * (7) Where, in the opinion of the Commission, the incapacity of a member of the Forces or member of a Peacekeeping Force was due to an accident that would not have occurred, or to a disease that would not have been contracted, but for his or her having rendered defence service or peacekeeping service, as the case may be, or but for changes in the member's environment consequent upon his or her having rendered any such service:

     * (a) if the incapacity of the member was due to an accident--that incapacity shall be deemed to have arisen out of the injury suffered by the member as a result of the accident and the injury so suffered shall be deemed to be a defencecaused injury suffered by the member; or

     * (b) if the incapacity was due to a disease--the incapacity shall be deemed to have arisen out of that disease and that disease shall be deemed to be a defencecaused disease contracted by the member, for the purposes of this Act.

    * (8) Neither paragraph (5)(b) nor (5A)(b) applies:

     * (a) to an accident that occurred while the member of the Forces or member of a Peacekeeping Force was travelling on a journey from the member's place of duty in a case where the member had delayed commencing the journey for a substantial period after he or she ceased to perform duty at that place (otherwise than for a reason connected with the performance of the member's duties) unless, in the circumstances of the particular case, the nature of the risk of sustaining an injury, or contracting a disease, was not substantially changed, and the extent of that risk was not substantially increased, by that delay or by anything that happened during that delay;

     * (b) to an accident that occurred while the member of the Forces or member of a Peacekeeping Force was travelling on a journey, or a part of a journey, by a route that was not reasonably direct having regard to the means of transport used unless:

      * (i) the journey, or that part of the journey, was made by that route for a reason connected with the performance of the member's duty; or

      * (ii) in the circumstances of the particular case, the nature of the risk of sustaining injury, or contracting disease, was not substantially changed, and the extent of that risk was not substantially increased, by reason that the journey, or that part of the journey, was made by that route; or

     * (c) to an accident that occurred while the member of the Forces or member of a Peacekeeping Force was travelling on a part of a journey made after a substantial interruption of the journey, being an interruption made for a reason unconnected with the performance of the member's duties, unless, in the circumstances of the particular case, the nature of the risk referred to in subparagraph (b)(ii) was not substantially changed and the extent of that risk was not substantially increased, by reason of the interruption.

    * (9) The Commonwealth is not liable under this section in respect of the death of a member of the Forces or a member of a Peacekeeping Force, or the incapacity of such a member, from injury or disease:

     * (a) in a case where the death occurred, or the injury was suffered, or disease was contracted, by the member in circumstances described in subsection (4) or in paragraph (5)(a), (b) or (c) or in paragraph (5A)(a), (b) or (c)--if the death, or the injury or disease, as the case may be:

      * (i) resulted from the member's serious default or wilful act; or

      * (ii) arose from a serious breach of discipline committed by the member or from an occurrence that happened while the member was committing a serious breach of discipline; or

     * (b) in the case of an injury suffered, or disease contracted, by the member to which paragraph (5)(d) or (5A)(d) applies:

      * (i) if the aggravation of the injury or disease:

         * (A) resulted from the member's serious default or wilful act; or

         * (B) arose from a serious breach of discipline by the member; or

      * (ii) unless the member has rendered hazardous service or the period of defence service or peacekeeping service that contributed to the injury or disease in a material degree, or by which the injury or disease was aggravated, was 6 months or longer.

    * (9A) The Commonwealth is not liable under this section in respect of:

     * (a) the death; or

     * (b) the incapacity from injury or disease;

    * of a member of the Forces, or a member of a Peacekeeping Force, if the death, injury or disease is related to the relevant service of the member only because:

     * (a) in the case of a member who had not used tobacco products before 1 January 1998--the member used tobacco products after 31 December 1997; or

     * (b) in the case of a member who had used tobacco products before 1 January 1998--the member increased his or her use of tobacco products after 31 December 1997.

    * (10) The Commonwealth is not liable under this section in respect of the death of a member of the Forces or a member of a Peacekeeping Force, or the incapacity of such a member, from injury or disease, if the death or incapacity resulted from the serious default or wilful act of the member that happened after the member ceased, or last ceased, to render defence service or peacekeeping service.

    * (10A) The Commonwealth is not liable to pay a pension to a dependant of a member of the Forces, or of a member of a Peacekeeping Force, being a child of the member, under subsection (1) or (2) if the dependant has attained the age of 16 years and payments, by way of a living allowance, are being made in respect of the child:

     * (a) the Commonwealth is not liable to pay a pension to the dependant under this section unless the decision by the Commission, the Board or the Administrative Appeals Tribunal, as the case may be, to grant the pension:

      * (i) was made before the commencement of this Act; or

      * (ii) was or is made after the commencement of this Act upon consideration or reconsideration of a claim for that pension that was duly made (whether before or after the commencement of this Act) before the remarriage, marriage or entry into the de facto relationship occurred; and

     * (b) a decision granting a pension to the dependant under this section made by the Commission, the Board or the Administrative Appeals Tribunal after that remarriage, marriage or entry into the de facto relationship occurred (including a decision granting such a pension as from a date before that remarriage, marriage or entry into the de facto relationship occurred) is void and of no effect unless the decision was made upon consideration or reconsideration of a claim for that pension made as described in subparagraph (a)(ii).

        * Note: For the meaning of **_reinstated pensioner_** see section 11AA.

    * (11A) If:

      * (a) the Commission, upon considering a claim for a pension in respect of the incapacity of a member of the Forces or a member of a Peacekeeping Force from injury or disease determines, or is satisfied, that the member suffered the injury or contracted the disease as claimed and that the injury is a defencecaused injury or the disease is a defencecaused disease, as the case may be; and

      * (b) the Commission is also satisfied that a determination under this Act is in force determining that the member has suffered an injury or contracted a disease (not being the injury or disease referred to in paragraph (a)) and that:

      * (c) if the claimant is not in receipt of a pension under Part IV or Part II--determine whether the claimant is entitled to be granted a pension under Part IV and, if it determines that the claimant is entitled to be granted a pension, assess the rate of the pension to be granted to the claimant; or

#### Division 5--Amount of advance payment

##### 79K  Amount of advance payment

    * (1) The amount of an advance payment of pension is the smaller of the following amounts:

     * (a) the amount of advance payment sought;

     * (b) the maximum amount of advance payment payable to the person as worked out as follows:

Method statement

      * Step 1.	Work out 3/52 of the person's advance payment eligible amount.

      * Step 2.	Work out the annual rate at which pension was payable to the person on the last payday before the application for the advance payment was made, disregarding:

        * (a) any amount payable by way of remote area allowance; and

        * (b) so much of the person's pension supplement amount (if any) as is equal to the person's minimum pension supplement amount.

      * Step 3.	Work out the smaller of the result of step 1 and:

        * (a) if the pension is a service pension or income support supplement--7.5% of the result of step 2; and

        * (b) otherwise--13 times the fortnightly rate of pension payable to the person.

      * Step 4.	Subtract the following from the result of step 3:

        * (a) each advance payment (if any) of pension paid to the person during any of the 13 fortnights immediately before the application for the current advance payment was made;

        * (b) each other advance payment (if any) of pension paid to the person that has not been fully repaid.

      * Step 5.	The result of step 4 (rounded to the nearest cent (rounding 0.5 cents upwards)) is the maximum amount of advance payment payable to the person.

        * Note 1: The amount of the advance payment will be more than the minimum eligible amount for the person (see paragraph 79B(2)(a)).

        * Note 2: For **_advance payment eligible amount_**, see subsection 5Q(1).

#### Division 6--Advance payment deductions

##### 79L  Advance payment deduction

    * (1) Subject to subsection (2) and section 79O, an advance payment deduction is to be made from an instalment of pension that is payable to a person if:

     * (a) the person has received an advance payment of that pension or of another pension that was previously payable to the person; and

     * (b) the person has not yet fully repaid the advance payment; and

     * (c) the amount of the advance payment that has not been repaid is not a debt under subsection 205(1AB).

    * (2) An advance payment deduction is not to be made from a person's instalment of pension on the payday on which the advance payment is paid.

##### 79M  Amount of advance payment deduction--basic calculation

    * Subject to sections 79N, 79O, 79P and 79Q, the advance payment deduction for an advance payment of a pension is the amount of the advance payment divided by 13.

##### 79N  Person may request larger advance payment deduction

    * (1) Subject to subsection (2) and sections 79O, 79P and 79Q, a person's advance payment deduction may be increased to a larger amount if the person asks the Commission in writing for the advance payment deduction to be the larger amount.

    * (2) Subsection (1) does not apply if the Commission is satisfied that the person would suffer severe financial hardship if the advance payment deduction were the larger amount.

##### 79O  Reduction of advance payment deduction in cases of severe financial hardship

    * (1) Subject to subsection (2) and sections 79P and 79Q, if:

     * (a) a person applies in writing to the Commission for an advance payment deduction to be decreased, or to be stopped, because of severe financial hardship; and

     * (b) the Commission is satisfied that:

      * (i) the person's circumstances are exceptional and could not reasonably have been foreseen at the time of the person's application for the advance payment; and

      * (ii) the person would suffer severe financial hardship if the advance payment deduction that would otherwise apply were to continue;

    * the Commission may determine in writing that, for the period stated in the determination, the advance payment deduction is to be the lesser amount (which may be a nil amount) stated in the determination.

    * (2) At any time while the determination is in force, the Commission may:

     * (a) vary the determination so as to require to be deducted from the person's instalments of pension an advance payment deduction larger than the deduction (if any) previously applying under the determination, but smaller than the deduction applying immediately before the determination; or

     * (b) revoke the determination;

    * but only if the Commission is satisfied that the person would not suffer severe financial hardship because of the variation or revocation.

    * (3) A variation or revocation of a determination must be in writing.

##### 79P  The final advance payment deduction

    * If an advance payment deduction that would otherwise be deducted from a person's instalment of pension exceeds the part of the advance payment that the person has not yet repaid (by previous deductions under this Division or otherwise), the amount of that advance payment deduction equals the part that the person has not yet repaid.

        * Example: 

        * Facts: Anne has been paid an advance of $450. Anne's payment deduction is worked out under section 79M as follows:

        * (The amount is rounded to the nearest cent under section 79R.).

        * Anne has requested that the advance payment deduction be the larger amount of $55 (see section 79N), so that the advance will be repaid sooner.

        * Result: If $55 is deducted from Anne's fortnightly instalment of pension, $440 will have been repaid after 8 successive fortnights, leaving $10 unpaid. Under this section, the final advance payment deduction will be $10.

##### 79Q  Payment rate insufficient to cover advance payment deduction

    * If the instalment of pension (excluding remote area allowance in the case of a pension payable under Part III or income support supplement) is less than the amount that would be the advance payment deduction apart from this section, the advance payment deduction is taken to be equal to that instalment of pension.

##### 79R  Rounding of amounts

    * An amount worked out under this Division is to be rounded to the nearest cent (rounding half a cent upwards).

##### 79S  Unrepaid advance payments to deceased partner to be disregarded

    * (1) In calculating, for the purposes of this Act, an amount of pension that would have been paid to a deceased person if the person had not died, any advance payment of pension that has been made to the person and has not been repaid is to be disregarded.

    * (2) Subsection (1) does not affect the liability of the estate of the deceased person to repay to the Commonwealth so much of the advance payment as has not been repaid.

#### Division 7--Review by Commission
