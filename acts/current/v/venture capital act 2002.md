##### 110  Interpretation

    * (1) An expression has the same meaning in this Act as in the _Income Tax Assessment Act 1997_.

##### 115  Identifying defined terms

    * (1) Many of the terms in this Act are defined in the Dictionary, starting at section 9951, to the _Income Tax Assessment Act 1997_.

    * (2) Most of the terms that are defined in that Dictionary are identified by an asterisk appearing at the start of the term: as in *Innovation Australia. The footnote with the asterisk contains a signpost to that Dictionary.

    * (3) An asterisk usually identifies the first occurrence of a term in a section (if not divided into subsections), subsection or definition. Later occurrences of the term in the same provision are not usually asterisked.

    * (4) Terms are not asterisked in headings, notes, examples, explanatory tables, guides, outline provisions or diagrams.

    * (5) If a term is not identified by an asterisk, disregard that fact in deciding whether or not to apply to that term a definition or other interpretation provision.

#### Division 3--A guide to this Act

##### 31  What this Act is about

    * This Act provides for some administrative measures that are needed for the operation of: 

     * (a) the capital gains tax exemption relating to venture capital under Subdivision 118F of the _Income Tax Assessment Act 1997_ (and the related provisions about similar income gains and losses); and

     * (b) the "flowthrough" treatment, under Division 5 of Part III of the _Income Tax Assessment Act 1936_, of the income of limited partnerships that are used as vehicles for making venture capital investments.

         * Note: Innovation  is responsible for the operation of these measures. The _Industry Research and Development Act 1986_ provides for the establishment and operation of Innovation Australia.

##### 35  Registration of limited partnerships (Part 2)

    * Part 2 provides for: 

     * (a) the registration requirements for venture capital limited partnerships, early stage venture capital limited partnerships and Australian venture capital funds of funds; and

     * (b) applications for registration; and

     * (c) registration of limited partnerships by Innovation Australia, including conditional registration; and

     * (d) the obligations imposed on general partners of partnerships that are registered; and

     * (e) revocation of registration.

##### 310  Registration of eligible venture capital investors (Part 3)

##### 325  Miscellaneous (Part 6)

    * Part 6 deals with miscellaneous matters.

### Part 2--Registration of limited partnerships

#### Division 7--A guide to this Part

##### 71  What this Part is about

    * Innovation  can register limited partnerships as venture capital limited partnerships, early stage venture capital limited partnerships or Australian venture capital funds of funds.

    * Registration is one of the requirements before investments of venture capital through a limited partnership can attract the operation of: 

     *  	the capital gains tax exemption relating to venture capital under Subdivision 118F of the _Income Tax Assessment Act 1997_ (and the related provisions about similar income gains and losses); and

     *  	the income tax exemption under section 5152 of the _Income Tax Assessment Act 1997_ (if the partnership is an early stage venture capital limited partnership); and

     *  	the "flowthrough" treatment, under Division 5 of Part III of the _Income Tax Assessment Act 1936_, of the income of limited partnerships.

    * Broadly speaking, Innovation Australia will register a limited partnership under Division 13 if an application meets the requirements of Division 11, unless Innovation Australia is satisfied that the partnership does not meet the applicable registration requirements of Division 9.

    * Conditional registration is an option if an application does not meet the requirements of Division 11.

           * Note: Conditional registration becomes important if full registration is achieved. Registration is then backdated at least to the time of conditional registration.

    * Innovation  can revoke a registration under Division 17. Broadly speaking, the grounds for revocation are:

     *  	failure to meet the applicable registration requirements of Division 9; and

     *  	failure to provide information as required under Division 15.

       * (ii) otherwise--the day on which the conditional registration was granted;

    * (9) If *Innovation Australia's decision is to refuse the request, the notice must also include a statement of its reasons for its decision.

    * (10) A failure to comply with subsection (8) or (9) does not affect the validity of the decision.

##### 1320  Deciding whether investment plans are appropriate

    * (1) In deciding, for the purposes of paragraph 131(1A)(c) or subsection 1315(5), whether it is satisfied that a partnership's investment plan, or a replacement for a partnership's *approved investment plan, is appropriate, *Innovation Australia must take into account the extent to which the partnership focuses on early stage venture capital, having regard to:

     * (c) the levels of technology of those entities; and

     * (i) whether the investment plan is connected with other plans for investment that, if combined with the investment plan, would lead to the partnership exceeding the limit on *committed capital under subparagraph 93(1)(d)(ii); and

     * (j) any additional matters specified in guidelines made under subsection (2).

    * (2) *Innovation Australia may, by legislative instrument, make guidelines specifying additional matters that it must take into account in deciding, for the purposes of paragraph 131(1A)(c) or subsection 1315(5), whether it is satisfied that:

     * (a) a partnership's investment plan is appropriate; or

     * (b) a replacement for a partnership's *approved investment plan is appropriate;

    * as the case requires.

    * (3) This section does not limit the matters that *Innovation Australia may take into account in deciding, for the purposes of paragraph 131(1A)(c) or subsection 1315(5), whether it is satisfied that:

     * (a) a partnership's investment plan is appropriate; or

     * (b) a replacement for a partnership's *approved investment plan is appropriate;

### Part 3--Registration of eligible venture capital investors

#### Division 21--Registration of eligible venture capital investors

##### Guide to Division 21

##### 211  What this Division is about

    * Innovation  can register entities as eligible venture capital investors, and revoke their registration.

    * Registration is one of the requirements before investments of venture capital by an entity directly (rather than through a limited partnership) can attract the operation of section 118415 of the _Income Tax Assessment Act 1997_ (and the related provisions about similar income gains and losses).

         * Note: Section 118415 of the _Income Tax Assessment Act 1997_ gives to an individual investor an equivalent capital gains tax exemption to the one that the investor could have, under section 118405 or 118410 of that Act, from investing through a limited partnership registered under Part 2 of this Act.
