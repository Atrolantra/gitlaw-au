DFISA bonus--see Division 3

     * DFISA bonus is payable to a person if the amount of the person's social security pension bonus has been reduced (including to nil) because the person, or the person's partner, has been paid adjusted disability pension (within the meaning of this Part).

DFISAlike payments--see Division 4

     * Regulations made under this Part may provide for DFISAlike payments to be paid to a person if adjusted disability pension (within the meaning of this Part) payable to the person, or the person's partner, reduces the amount of a payment payable to the person under a Commonwealth Act, regulations or an instrument made under such an Act, or a Commonwealth administered program.

     * (2) However, DFISA is not payable to the person on that day if:

      * (a) the rate of DFISA would be nil; or

      * (b) section 1129, 1130B or 1131 of the Social Security Act (financial hardship) applies to the person in relation to the primary payment; or

      * (c) before that day:

##### Subdivision B--Rate of Defence Force Income Support Allowance

##### 118NC  Rate of Defence Force Income Support Allowance

     * DFISA rate where primary payment is neither compensation affected nor prescribed

     * (1) The rate of DFISA on a day that is on or after 20 September 2004 is worked out using method statement 1 in this subsection, unless:

      * (a) Part 3.14 of the Social Security Act (compensation recovery) applies to reduce the rate of the primary payment on that day (in which case see method statement 2 in subsection (2)); or

      * (b) the primary payment is a social security pension or social security benefit that is prescribed for the purposes of this section (in which case, see subsection (3)).

         * Note: For **_primary payment_** see section 118NB.

Method Statement 1

       * Step 1.	Work out the daily provisional payment rate for the primary payment on that day.

            * Note: For **_daily provisional payment rate _**see subsection (4).

       * Step 2.	Work out what would have been the daily provisional payment rate (the **_notional rate_**) for the primary payment on that day if both of the following assumptions were made:

       * _First assumption_

       * _	The first assumption is that the adjusted disability pension payable to the person, or the person's partner, were an excluded amount (see section 118NA).

            * Note: This will mean the adjusted disability pension will not be treated as income when calculating the notional rate.

       * _Second assumption_

       * _	The second assumption is that, if an amount of rent assistance was included in the primary payment, that amount were reduced (but not to less than nil) by the rent assistance reduction amount.

            * Note: For **_rent assistance_** and **_rent assistance reduction amount_** see subsection (4).

       * Step 3.	Subtract the daily provisional payment rate under step 1 from the notional rate under step 2. The difference is the rate of DFISA on that day.

     * DFISA rate where primary payment is compensation affected but not prescribed

     * (2) The rate of DFISA on a day that is on or after 20 September 2004 is worked out using method statement 2 in this subsection if:

      * (a) Part 3.14 of the Social Security Act (compensation recovery) applies to reduce the rate of the primary payment on that day; and

      * (b) the primary payment is not a social security pension or social security benefit that is prescribed for the purposes of this section.

         * Note: For **_primary payment_** see section 118NB.

Method Statement 2

       * Step 1.	Work out the daily provisional payment rate for the primary payment on that day.

            * Note: For **_daily provisional payment rate _**see subsection (4).

       * Step 2.	Work out the amount by which Part 3.14 of the Social Security Act reduces the daily primary payment rate on that day.

       * Step 3.	Subtract the amount in step 2 from the rate in step 1.

       * Step 4.	Work out what would have been the daily provisional payment rate (the **_notional rate_**) for the primary payment on that day if the 2 assumptions referred to in step 2 of method statement 1 in subsection (1) were made.

#### Division 8--Seniors Health Card Income Test Calculator

##### 118ZZA  Seniors Health Card Income Test Calculator

     * The Seniors Health Card Income Test Calculator at the end of this section is to be used in working out whether a person satisfies the seniors health card income test for the purposes of this Act.

#### Seniors Health Card Income Test Calculator

     * Satisfying the seniors health card income test

     * 118ZZA1	This is how to work out whether a person satisfies the seniors health card income test at a particular time (the **_test time_**).

Method statement

       * Step 1.	Work out the amount of the person's adjusted taxable income for the reference tax year.

       * Step 1A.	If, at the test time, the person, or the person's partner (if any), has at least one longterm financial asset (see point 118ZZA12), work out the person's deemed income amount under:

         * (a) if, at the test time, the person is not a member of a couple--point 118ZZA10A; or

         * (b) if, at the test time, the person is a member of a couple--point 118ZZA10B.

       * Step 1B.	Work out the sum of the amounts at step 1 and step 1A (if any).

       * Step 2.	Work out the person's seniors health card income limit using point 118ZZA11.

       * Step 3.	Work out whether the amount at step 1B exceeds the seniors health card income limit.

       * Step 4.	If the amount at step 1B is less than the person's seniors health card income limit, the person satisfies the seniors health card income test.

       * Step 5.	If the amount at step 1B is equal to or exceeds the person's seniors health card income limit, the person does not satisfy the seniors health card income test.

     * Reference tax year

     * 118ZZA2(1)	In the ordinary case, a person's **_reference tax year_** is:

      * (a) if the person has received a notice of assessment of his or her taxable income for the tax year immediately preceding the tax year in which the test time occurred--that immediately preceding tax year; or

      * (b) otherwise--the tax year immediately preceding the tax year applicable under paragraph (a).

     * (2) However, if the person has informed the Secretary in writing that the person wishes to have his or her entitlement to a seniors health card determined by reference to his or her adjusted taxable income for the tax year in which the test time occurred (the **_current tax year_**), the person's **_reference tax year _**is the current tax year.

     * Adjusted taxable income

     * 118ZZA3	For the purposes of this Division, a person's **_adjusted taxable income _**for a particular tax year is the sum of the following amounts (**_income components_**):

      * (a) the person's taxable income for that year;

      * (b) the person's fringe benefits value for that year;

      * (c) the person's target foreign income for that year;

      * (d) the person's total net investment loss (within the meaning of the _Income Tax Assessment Act 1997_) for that year;

      * (e) the person's reportable superannuation contributions (within the meaning of the _Income Tax Assessment Act 1997_) for that year.

         * Note 1: For **_taxable income_** see point 118ZZA4.

         * Note 2: For **_fringe benefits value_** see point 118ZZA5.

         * Note 3: For **_target foreign income_** see point 118ZZA6.

     * Taxable income

     * 118ZZA4(1)	In this Division:

     * **_taxable income_** has the same meaning as in the _Income Tax Assessment Act 1997_.

     * (2) For the purposes of this Division, a person's **_taxable income _**for a particular tax year is:

      * (a) the person's assessed taxable income for that year; or

      * (b) if the person does not have an assessed taxable income for that year--the person's accepted estimate of taxable income for that year.

     * (3) For the purposes of this Division, a person's **_assessed taxable income_** for a particular tax year at a particular time is the most recent of:

      * (a) if, at that time, the Commissioner of Taxation has made an assessment or an amended assessment of that taxable income--that taxable income according to the assessment or amended assessment; or

      * (b) if, at that time, a tribunal has amended an assessment or an amended assessment made by the Commissioner--that taxable income according to the amendment made by the tribunal; or

      * (c) if, at that time, a court has amended an assessment or an amended assessment made by the Commissioner or an amended assessment made by a tribunal--that taxable income according to the amendment made by the court.

     * Fringe benefits value

     * 118ZZA5(1)	For the purposes of this Division, a person's **_fringe benefits value _**for a particular tax year is the person's accepted estimate of the amount by which the total of the assessable fringe benefits received or to be received by the person in the tax year exceeds $1,000.

     * (2) In this point:

     * **_assessable fringe benefit_** has the meaning given by subsection 10A(2) of the _Social Security Act 1991_.

     * (3) The value of an assessable fringe benefit is to be worked out in accordance with Part 3.12A of the _Social Security Act 1991_ except that references in that Part to the Minister and to the Secretary are to be taken to be references to the Minister for Veterans' Affairs and to the Secretary of the Department of Veterans' Affairs, respectively.

     * Target foreign income

     * 118ZZA6(1)		In this Division:

     * **_foreign income_**, in relation to a person, means:

      * (b) a periodical payment by way of gift or allowance from a source outside Australia; or

      * (c) a periodical benefit by way of gift or allowance from a source outside Australia.

     * **_target foreign income_** means foreign income that is not:

      * (a) taxable income; or

      * (b) received in the form of a fringe benefit.

     * (2) For the purposes of this Division, a person's **_target foreign income _**for a particular tax year is the person's accepted estimate of the amount of that income for that year.

     * Total net investment loss

     * 118ZZA7		For the purposes of this Division, a person's **_total net investment loss_** for a particular tax year is the person's accepted estimate of the amount of that loss for that year.

     * Accepted estimate

     * 118ZZA8		For the purposes of this Division, a person's **_accepted estimate_** of an income component for a particular tax year is that income component according to the most recent notice given by the person to the Secretary under point 118ZZA9 and accepted by the Commission for the purposes of this Part.

     * Notice estimating income component

     * 118ZZA9(1)		A person may give the Secretary a notice, in a form approved by the Commission, setting out the person's estimate of an income component of the person for a tax year.

     * (2) The notice is to contain, or be accompanied by, such information as is required by the form to be contained in it or to accompany it, as the case may be.

     * (3) The Commission is to accept a notice only if the Commission is satisfied that the estimate is reasonable.

     * Adjusted taxable income of members of couples

     * 118ZZA10		If a person is a member of a couple, add the couple's adjusted taxable incomes for the reference tax year and divide by 2 to work out the amount of the person's adjusted taxable income for the reference tax year.

     * Deemed income amount

     * 118ZZA10A		This is how to work out the person's deemed income amount under this point:

Method statement

       * Step 1.	Work out the total value of all of the person's longterm financial assets (see point 118ZZA12) at the test time.

       * Step 2.	Work out under section 46D the amount of ordinary income the person would be taken to receive per year on his or her financial assets:

         * (a) on the assumption that the only financial assets of the person were the financial assets referred to in step 1; and

         * (b) on the assumption that the total value of the person's financial assets were the amount at step 1.

       * Step 3.	The result at step 2 is the person's **_deemed income amount_**.

     * 118ZZA10B		This is how to work out the person's deemed income amount under this point:

Method statement

       * Step 1.	Work out the total value of all of the person's longterm financial assets (see point 118ZZA12) at the test time.

       * Step 2.	If, at the test time, the person's partner has reached the minimum age mentioned in section 30110 of the _Income Tax Assessment Act 1997_, work out the total value of all of the person's partner's longterm financial assets (see point 118ZZA12) at the test time.

       * Step 3.	Work out under section 46E the amount of ordinary income the couple would be taken to receive per year on their financial assets:

         * (a) on the assumption that the only financial assets of the person and the person's partner were the financial assets referred to in steps 1 and 2; and

         * (b) on the assumption that the total value of the couple's financial assets were the sum of the amounts at steps 1 and 2.

       * Step 4.	Divide the amount at step 3 by 2: the result is the person's **_deemed income amount_**.

     * Seniors health card income limit

     * 118ZZA11		A person's seniors health card income limit is worked out using the Seniors Health Card Income Limit Table. Work out which family situation in the table applies to the person. The person's seniors health card income limit is the corresponding amount in column 3 plus an additional corresponding amount in column 4 for each dependent child of the person.

         * Note 1: For **_member of couple_** and **_partnered_**, see section 5E.

         * Note 2: For **_illness separated couple_** and **_respite care couple_**, see section 5R.

         * Note: This means that the members of the Authority are officials of the Department for the purposes of the _Public Governance, Performance and Accountability Act 2013_.

##### 196B  Functions of Authority

     * (1) This section sets out the functions of the Repatriation Medical Authority. The main function of the Authority is to determine Statements of Principles for the purposes of this Act and the MRCA.

     * Determination of Statement of Principles

     * (2) If the Authority is of the view that there is sound medicalscientific evidence that indicates that a particular kind of injury, disease or death can be related to:

      * (a) operational service rendered by veterans; or

      * (b) peacekeeping service rendered by members of Peacekeeping Forces; or

      * (c) hazardous service rendered by members of the Forces; or

      * (caa) British nuclear test defence service rendered by members of the Forces; or

      * (ca) warlike or nonwarlike service rendered by members;

     * the Authority must determine a Statement of Principles in respect of that kind of injury, disease or death setting out:

      * (d) the factors that must as a minimum exist; and

      * (e) which of those factors must be related to service rendered by a person;

     * before it can be said that a reasonable hypothesis has been raised connecting an injury, disease or death of that kind with the circumstances of that service.

         * Note 1: For **_sound medicalscientific evidence _**see subsection 5AB(2).

         * Note 2: For **_peacekeeping service_**, **_member of a Peacekeeping Force_**, **_hazardous service_**, **_member of the Forces_** and **_British nuclear test defence service_** referred to in paragraphs (2)(b), (c) and (caa), see subsection 5Q(1A).

     * before it can be said that, on the balance of probabilities, an injury, disease or death of that kind is connected with the circumstances of that service.

         * Note 1: For **_sound medicalscientific evidence _**see subsection 5AB(2).

         * Note 2: For **_defence service_**, **_hazardous service_**, **_British nuclear test defence service_** and **_member of the Forces_** referred to in paragraph (3)(b), see subsection 5Q(1A).

      * (b) of its own initiative, decides that a particular kind of injury, disease or death ought to be investigated for the purposes of this Act, or the MRCA, to find out whether a Statement of Principles may be determined in respect of it;

     * the Authority must carry out an investigation to obtain information that would enable the Authority to establish: 

      * (c) how the injury may be suffered or sustained, the disease may be contracted or the death may occur; and

      * (d) the extent (if any) to which:

       * (i) the injury, disease or death may be warcaused or defencecaused; or

       * (ii) the injury, disease or death may be a service injury, a service disease or a service death.

         * Note 1: For **_warcaused_** see sections 8 and 9.

     * (5) If, after carrying out the investigation, the Authority is of the view that there is sound medicalscientific evidence on which it can rely to determine a Statement of Principles under subsection (2) or (3), in respect of that kind of injury, disease or death, the Authority must do so as soon as practicable.

         * Note: This subsection does not mean that the Authority must carry out an investigation before it can determine a Statement of Principles under subsection (2) or (3).

     * (6) If, after carrying out the investigation, the Authority is of the view:

      * (a) that there is no sound medicalscientific evidence on which it can rely to determine a Statement of Principles under subsection (2) or (3) in respect of that kind of injury, disease or death; or

      * (b) that the sound medicalscientific evidence on which it can rely is insufficient to allow it to do so;

     * the Authority must make a declaration in writing: 

      * (c) stating that it does not propose to make a Statement of Principles; and

      * (d) giving the reasons for its decision.

     * Subsequent investigation and review of determinations concerning Statement of Principles

     * (7) If the Authority:

      * (a) is asked under section 196E to review:

       * (i) some or all of the contents of a Statement of Principles; or

      * (d) how the injury may be suffered or sustained, the disease may be contracted or the death may occur; or

      * (e) the extent (if any) to which:

       * (i) the injury, disease or death may be warcaused or defencecaused; or

       * (ii) the injury, disease or death may be a service injury, a service disease or a service death.

         * Note 1: For **_warcaused _**see sections 8 and 9.

         * Note 2: For **_defencecaused _**see section 69.

         * Note 3: For **_service injury_**, **_service disease_** and **_service death_** see section 196KA. (These definitions are for the purposes of the MRCA_._)

     * (7A) If the investigation:

      * (a) relates to a request under section 196E to review some of the contents of a Statement of Principles; or

      * (b) is one to which paragraph (7)(b) applies and that relates to some of the contents of a Statement of Principles; or

      * (c) is carried out because of a direction under subsection 196W(7) by the Review Council following a request to the Council under section 196Z to review the Authority's refusal to carry out an investigation relating to a request under section 196E to review some of the contents of a Statement of Principles;

     * the Authority may limit its investigation to matters relating to those contents.

         * Note: For **_Review Council_** see subsection 5AB(1).

     * (8) If, after carrying out the investigation, the Authority is of the view that there is a new body of sound medicalscientific evidence available that, together with the sound medicalscientific evidence previously considered by the Authority, justifies the making of a Statement of Principles, or an amendment of the Statement of Principles already determined, in respect of that kind of injury, disease or death, the Authority must:

      * (a) determine a Statement of Principles in respect of that kind of injury, disease or death under subsection (2) or (3); or

      * (b) make a determination amending the Statement of Principles determined under subsection (2) or (3) in respect of that kind of injury, disease or death; or

      * (c) make a determination revoking the Statement of Principles determined under subsection (2) or (3), and determine a new Statement of Principles under subsection (2) or (3) in respect of that kind of injury, disease or death;

      * (a) that there is no new sound medicalscientific evidence about that kind of injury, disease or death; or

      * (b) that the new sound medicalscientific evidence available is not sufficient to justify the making of a Statement of Principles, or an amendment of the Statement of Principles already determined in respect of that kind of injury, disease or death;

     * the Authority must make a declaration in writing: 

      * (c) stating that it does not propose to make a Statement of Principles, or amend the Statement of Principles already determined (as the case may be); and

      * (d) giving the reasons for its decision.

     * (10) If the Review Council has, by a decision notified in the _Gazette_, directed the Authority to amend a Statement of Principles in respect of a particular kind of injury, disease or death, the Authority must make a determination amending the Statement of Principles determined in respect of that kind of injury, disease or death in accordance with the directions of the Council.

      * (a) the factors that must as a minimum exist; and

      * (b) which of those factors must be related to service rendered by a person;

      * (a) the factors that must exist; and

      * (b) which of those factors must be related to service rendered by a person;

     * (13A) A determination under this section:

      * (a) must be in writing; and

      * (b) rounding off the provisional replacement amount in accordance with section 198M, using the rounding base for the base amount (see column 4 of Table A).

     * (3) For the purposes of subsection (1), the base amount is to include any indexation that occurs on 1 July 2000 under Division 18 of Part IIIB or section 198, 198A, 198D or 198F.

##### 198GA  1 July 2000 increase in rent assistance amounts

     * (1) This section applies to an amount (the **_base amount_**) of rent assistance that is provided for in column 4 of the table in subpoint SCH6C8(1).

         * Note: Amounts provided for in column 4 of the table in subpoint SCH6C8(1) are amounts as altered from time to time under Division 18 of Part IIIB (CPI indexation).

     * (2) This Act has effect as if, on 1 July 2000, the base amount were replaced by an amount (the **_replacement amount_**) worked out by:

      * (a) calculating the amount (the **_provisional replacement amount_**) that is 10% greater than the base amount; and

      * (b) rounding off the provisional replacement amount in accordance with section 198M, using the rounding base of $5.20.

##### 198H  Adjustment of amounts following 1 July 2000 increase

     * (1) If an amount (the **_affected amount_**) is:

      * (a) an amount described in the table in section 198G that is indexed under Division 18 of Part IIIB or under section 198, 198A, 198D or 198F; or

      * (b) the amount described in section 198GA; or

      * (c) a maximum basic rate provided for in point SCH6B1; or

      * (d) a pension supplement provided for in point SCH6BA2; or

      * (e) an amount provided for in paragraph 30(1)(a); or

      * (f) a pension supplement provided for in subsection 30(1A);

     * this section applies to modify the way the amount is indexed under that Division or section (as the case may be) for a limited period after 19 March 2001.

Method statement

       * Step 1.	Work out the current figure for the affected amount on 19 March 2001.

       * Step 2.	Multiply the current figure by 0.02. The result is the **_provisional overall adjustment amount_**.

       * Step 3.	Round off the provisional overall adjustment amount in accordance with subsections (6) to (8), using:

         * (a) for an affected amount described in the table in section 198G--the rounding base set out in that table for that amount; and

         * (b) for the amount described in section 198GA--the rounding base of $5.20; and

         * (c) for a maximum basic rate provided for in point SCH6B1--the rounding base of $2.60; and

         * (d) for a pension supplement provided for in point SCH6BA2--the rounding base of $0.10; and

         * (e) for an amount provided for in paragraph 30(1)(a)--the rounding base of $0.10; and

         * (f) for a pension supplement provided for in subsection 30(1A)--the rounding base of $0.10.

       * The result is the **_overall adjustment amount_**.

       * Step 4.	For the first indexation day for an affected amount that occurs after 19 March 2001, subtract the current figure from the indexed amount (arrived at using the method statement in subsection 59C(2)). The result (which could be zero) is the **_first indexation increase amount_**.

       * Step 5.	Compare the overall adjustment amount with the first indexation increase amount. If the overall adjustment amount is equal to or less than the first indexation increase amount, go to step 6. If the overall adjustment amount is greater than the first indexation increase amount, go to step 9.

       * Step 6.	Subtract the overall adjustment amount from the indexed amount referred to in step 4.

       * Step 7.	If the indexed amount is a pension supplement, round off the result in accordance with subsections (6) to (8) (as if the amount were a provisional overall adjustment amount), using the rounding base of $2.60.

       * Step 8.	The result obtained under step 6 or step 7 (as the case requires) is taken to be the indexed amount for the purposes of step 5 of the method statement in subsection 59C(2) and this section has no further application in relation to the affected amount.

            * Note: The indexed amount for the purposes of step 5 of the method statement in subsection 59C(2) may be increased under section 59EA in certain cases. Similarly, if the indexed amount is a rate worked out under section 198, that amount may be increased under subsection 198(6) or (7) in certain cases.

       * Step 9.	The indexed amount for the purposes of step 5 of the method statement in subsection 59C(2) is taken to be equal to the current figure worked out under step 2 of the method statement in subsection 59C(2). Go to step 10.

            * Note: The indexed amount for the purposes of step 5 of the method statement in subsection 59C(2) may be increased under section 59EA in certain cases. Similarly, if the indexed amount is a rate worked out under section 198, that amount may be increased under subsection 198(6) or (7) in certain cases.

       * Step 10.	For the second indexation day for the affected amount that occurs after 19 March 2001, subtract the first indexation increase amount from the overall adjustment amount. The result is the **_remaining adjustment amount_**.

       * Step 11.	Subtract the current figure from the indexed amount (arrived at using the method statement in subsection 59C(2)). The result (which could be zero) is the **_second indexation increase amount_**.

       * Step 12.	Compare the remaining adjustment amount with the second indexation increase amount. If the remaining adjustment amount is equal to or less than the second indexation increase amount, go to step 13. If the remaining adjustment amount is greater than the second indexation increase amount, go to step 16.

       * Step 13.	Subtract the remaining adjustment amount from the indexed amount.

       * Step 14.	If the indexed amount is a pension supplement, round off the result in accordance with subsections (6) to (8) (as if the amount were a provisional overall adjustment amount), using the rounding base of $2.60.

       * Step 15.	The result obtained under step 13 or step 14 (as the case requires) is taken to be the indexed amount for the purposes of step 5 of the method statement in subsection 59C(2) and this section has no further application in relation to the affected amount.

            * Note: The indexed amount for the purposes of step 5 of the method statement in subsection 59C(2) may be increased under section 59EA in certain cases. Similarly, if the indexed amount is a rate worked out under section 198, that amount may be increased under subsection 198(6) or (7) in certain cases.

       * Step 16.	The indexed amount for the purposes of step 5 of the method statement in subsection 59C(2) is taken to be equal to the current figure worked out under step 2 of the method statement in subsection 59C(2). Go to step 17.

            * Note: The indexed amount for the purposes of step 5 of the method statement in subsection 59C(2) may be increased under section 59EA in certain cases. Similarly, if the indexed amount is a rate worked out under section 198, that amount may be increased under subsection 198(6) or (7) in certain cases.

       * Step 17.	Repeat the method set out in steps 10 to 16 in relation to the third indexation day and to subsequent indexation days until the remaining adjustment amount is zero.

     * Meaning of terms in method statement if amount is indexed under section 198, 198A, 198D or 198F

     * (2) For the purposes of applying the Method statement in this section to an affected amount indexed under section 198, 198A, 198D or 198F, the following expressions used in the Method statement have the meanings set out below:

     * **_current figure_**, as at a particular time, means the rate most recently substituted for a relevant rate under section 198, 198A, 198D or 198F (as the case may be) before that time.

     * **_indexed amount _**means the rate worked out under subsection (4) of section 198, 198A, 198D or 198F (as the case may be).

##### 198MA  Adjustment of indexation factor under section 59D for limited time on and after 20 March 2013 for certain purposes

     * Application

     * (1) This section applies for purposes connected with the following payments on or after 20 March 2013:

      * (a) a service pension;

      * (b) seniors supplement;

      * (c) a pension under Part II or IV at a rate determined under or by reference to Division 4 of Part II or subsection 30(1);

      * (d) Special Rate Disability Pension under the MRCA;

      * (e) compensation under Division 2 (Compensation for member's death for wholly dependent partners) of Part 2 of Chapter 5 of the MRCA.

         * Note 1: Section 198 of the MRCA sets Special Rate Disability Pension by reference to the rate of pension under section 24 of this Act (so indexation of amounts affecting that rate also affects that pension).

         * Note 2: Division 2 of Part 2 of Chapter 5 of the MRCA sets compensation under that Division by reference to the rate of pension under subsection 30(1) of this Act (so indexation of amounts affecting that rate also affects the compensation).

     * Adjustment of indexation factor

     * (2) An indexation factor that:

      * (a) is worked out under section 59D on a day that is on or after 20 March 2013; and

      * (b) is directly or indirectly relevant to the indexation of an amount provided for by:

       * (i) subsection 5GA(1) (which provides for the PS rate mentioned in table item 2 of section 59A); or

       * (ii) subsection 5GA(2) (which provides for the PS minimum rate mentioned in table item 2A of section 59A); or

       * (iii) subsection 5GA(4) (which provides for the PS basic rate mentioned in table item 2B of section 59A); or

       * (iv) subsection 22(3) or (4), 23(4) or 24(4); or

       * (v) paragraph 30(1)(a) or (b); or

       * (vi) table item 2 of point SCH6B1 of the Rate Calculator (which provides for the pension MBR mentioned in table item 1 of section 59A);

     * is, for the purposes of the indexation of such an amount on that day, to be reduced by the broughtforward CPI indexation amount, but not below 1.

         * Note 1: An indexation factor worked out under section 59D is indirectly relevant to the indexation of an amount provided for by subsection 22(3) or (4), 23(4) or 24(4) or paragraph 30(1)(b). This is because:

          * (a) section 198 provides for indexation of such an amount by reference to the pension MBR factor worked out under section 59LA; and

          * (b) the pension MBR factor depends on the increase in the single pension rate MBR amount, which in turn depends (under section 59G) on indexation of the pension MBR amount under section 59C, which involves the indexation factor worked out under section 59D.

         * Note 2: An indexation factor worked out under section 59D is indirectly relevant to the indexation of an amount provided for by paragraph 30(1)(a). This is because that amount is affected by indexation under section 59G, which in turn depends on indexation under section 59C.

         * Note 3: Once the broughtforward CPI indexation amount becomes 0, there will be no further reduction of the indexation factor.

         * Example: Assume that the indexation factor worked out under section 59D on 20 March 2013 is 1.005. The broughtforward CPI indexation amount in relation to 20 March 2013 is 0.007 (as there has been no previous reduction). That indexation factor is reduced to 1 on 20 March 2013.

         * Further assume that on 20 September 2013 the indexation factor is 1.010. The broughtforward CPI indexation amount in relation to 20 September 2013 is 0.002. That indexation factor is reduced to 1.008 on 20 September 2013.

         * The broughtforward CPI indexation amount in relation to later indexation days is now 0 so there is no further reduction of the indexation factor.

     * Definition of **broughtforward CPI indexation amount**

     * **	(3)	In this section:

     * **_broughtforward CPI indexation amount_** for a day means:

      * (a) 0.007 less any reduction made under subsection (2) for an earlier day; or

      * (b) 0 if the broughtforward PBLCI indexation amount for the day under section 198MB is 0.

##### 198MB  Adjustment of living cost indexation factor for limited time on and after 20 March 2013 for certain purposes

     * Application

     * (1) This section applies for purposes connected with the following payments on or after 20 March 2013:

      * (a) a service pension;

      * (b) a pension under Part II or IV at a rate determined under or by reference to section 22, 23 or 24 or subsection 30(1);

      * (c) Special Rate Disability Pension under the MRCA;

      * (d) compensation under Division 2 (Compensation for member's death for wholly dependent partners) of Part 2 of Chapter 5 of the MRCA.

         * Note 1: Section 198 of the MRCA sets Special Rate Disability Pension by reference to the rate of pension under section 24 of this Act (so indexation of amounts affecting that rate also affects that pension).

         * Note 2: Division 2 of Part 2 of Chapter 5 of the MRCA sets compensation under that Division by reference to the rate of pension under subsection 30(1) of this Act (so indexation of amounts affecting that rate also affects the compensation).

     * Adjustment of living cost indexation factor

     * (2) A living cost indexation factor that:

      * (a) is worked out under section 59EAB on a day that is on or after 20 March 2013; and

      * (b) is directly or indirectly relevant to the indexation of an amount provided for by:

       * (i) subsection 22(3) or (4), 23(4) or 24(4); or

       * (ii) paragraph 30(1)(a) or (b); or

       * (iii) table item 2 of point SCH6B1 of the Rate Calculator (which provides for the pension MBR mentioned in table item 1 of section 59A);

     * is, for the purposes of the indexation of such an amount on that day, to be reduced by the broughtforward PBLCI indexation amount, but not below 1.

         * Note 1: A living cost indexation factor worked out under section 59EAB is indirectly relevant to the indexation of an amount provided for by subsection 22(3) or (4), 23(4) or 24(4) or paragraph 30(1)(b). This is because:

          * (a) section 198 provides for indexation of such an amount by reference to the pension MBR factor worked out under section 59LA; and

          * (b) the pension MBR factor depends on the increase in the single pension rate MBR amount, which in turn depends (under section 59G) on indexation of the pension MBR amount under section 59C, which may involve the living cost indexation factor worked out under section 59EAB.

         * Note 2: A living cost indexation factor worked out under section 59EAB is indirectly relevant to the indexation of an amount provided for by paragraph 30(1)(a). This is because that amount is affected by indexation under section 59G, which in turn depends on indexation under section 59C.

         * Note 3: Once the broughtforward PBLCI indexation amount becomes 0, there will be no further reduction of the living cost indexation factor.

         * Example: Assume that the living cost indexation factor worked out under section 59EAB on 20 March 2013 is 1.005. The broughtforward PBLCI indexation amount in relation to 20 March 2013 is 0.007 (as there has been no previous reduction). That living cost indexation factor is reduced to 1 on 20 March 2013.

         * Further assume that on 20 September 2013 the living cost indexation factor is 1.010. The broughtforward PBLCI indexation amount in relation to 20 September 2013 is 0.002. That living cost indexation factor is reduced to 1.008 on 20 September 2013.

         * The broughtforward PBLCI indexation amount in relation to later indexation days is now 0 so there is no further reduction of the indexation factor.

     * Definition of **broughtforward PBLCI indexation amount**

     * **	(3)	In this section:

     * **_broughtforward PBLCI indexation amount_** for a day means:

      * (a) 0.007 less any reduction made under subsection (2) for an earlier day; or
