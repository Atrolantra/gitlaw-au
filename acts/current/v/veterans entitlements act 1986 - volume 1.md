       * (i) when the amalgamation occurred; and

##### 8  Warcaused death

    * (1) Subject to this section and section 9A, for the purposes of this Act, the death of a veteran shall be taken to have been warcaused if:

      * (e) the injury or disease from which the veteran died:

       * (i) was suffered or contracted while the veteran was rendering eligible war service, but did not arise out of that service; or

       * (ii) was suffered or contracted before the commencement of the period, or last period, of eligible war service rendered by the veteran, but not while the veteran was rendering eligible war service;

      * and, in the opinion of the Commission, the injury or disease was contributed to in a material degree by, or was aggravated by, any eligible war service rendered by the veteran, being service rendered after the veteran suffered that injury or contracted that disease; or

           * Note: The effect of paragraph (f) is that, if the veteran has died from an injury or disease that has already been determined by the Commission to be warcaused, the death is to be taken to have been warcaused. Accordingly the Commission is not required to relate the death to eligible war service rendered by the veteran and sections 120A and 120B do not apply.

    * but not otherwise.

    * (2) Paragraph (1)(a), (b), (c) or (d) does not apply to the death of a veteran if the death:

      * (b) to an accident that occurred while the veteran was travelling on a journey, or a part of a journey, by a route that was not reasonably direct having regard to the means of transport used unless:

       * (ii) in the circumstances of the particular case, the nature of the risk of sustaining an injury, or contracting a disease, was not substantially changed, and the extent of that risk was not substantially increased, by reason that the journey, or that part of the journey, was made by that route; or

      * (c) to an accident that occurred while the veteran was travelling on a part of a journey made after a substantial interruption of the journey, being an interruption made for a reason unconnected with the performance of the veteran's duties, unless, in the circumstances of the particular case, the nature of the risk referred to in subparagraph (b)(ii) was not substantially changed, and the extent of that risk was not substantially increased, by reason of that interruption.

    * (5) Paragraph (1)(e) does not apply to the death of a veteran from an injury or disease, being injury or disease that has been contributed to in a material degree by, or aggravated by, eligible war service rendered by the veteran, unless the veteran has rendered operational service or the period of the eligible war service rendered by the veteran that so contributed to the injury or disease, or by which the injury or disease was aggravated, was 6 months or longer.

    * (6) Despite subsection (1), the death of a veteran is taken not to have been warcaused if the veteran's death is related to the veteran's eligible war service only because:

    * (2) For the purposes of this Act, where any incapacity of a veteran was, in the opinion of the Commission, due to an accident that would not have occurred, or due to a disease that would not have been contracted, but for his or her having rendered eligible war service or but for changes in the veteran's environment consequent upon his or her having rendered eligible war service:

      * (a) if that incapacity was due to an accident--that incapacity shall be deemed to have arisen out of the injury suffered by the veteran as a result of the accident and the injury so suffered shall be deemed to be a warcaused injury suffered by the veteran; or

      * (b) if the incapacity was due to a disease--the incapacity shall be deemed to have arisen out of that disease and that disease shall be deemed to be a warcaused disease contracted by the veteran.

       * (ii) in the circumstances of the particular case, the nature of the risk of sustaining an injury, or contracting a disease, was not substantially changed, and the extent of the risk was not substantially increased, by reason that the journey, or that part of the journey, was made by that route; or

      * in respect of incapacity resulting from his or her employment in connection with warlike operations in which the Crown was engaged, not being incapacity only from the injury or disease, or both, referred to in paragraph (a);

    * the rate of those periodical payments, or the amount of that lumpsum payment, as the case may be, shall be taken into account in assessing the rate of the pension referred to in paragraph (a) so that the total of the payments by way of that pension and of the payments or payment referred to in paragraph (b) do not exceed the total of the payments that the veteran would be entitled to receive by way of pension under this Part in respect of the incapacity referred to in paragraphs (a) and (b), assuming, for the purposes only of this subsection, that the incapacity referred to in paragraph (b) was wholly incapacity from warcaused injury for the purposes of this Part.

    * (3) Where:

      * (a) the rate per year by which the rate of a veteran's pension is required by subsection (1) to be reduced exceeds the rate that, but for that subsection, would be the rate per year of that pension; or

      * (b) the rate of the periodical payments or amount of the lump sum payment that is required by subsection (2) to be taken into account in assessing the rate of a veteran's pension is such as to require the assessment of the rate of that pension at a rate that does not exceed nought per centum;

##### 27  Increased rates of pension in certain cases

    * (1) This section applies to a veteran (other than a veteran to whom section 24 applies) who is being paid, or is eligible to be paid, a pension under this Part in respect of incapacity from a warcaused injury or a warcaused disease of a kind described in column 1 of the following table:

    * (2) Subject to subsection (3), the rate at which pension is payable under section 22, 23 or 25 to a veteran to whom this section applies is a rate equal to the sum of:

      * (a) the rate applicable to that pension under section 22, 23 or 25, as the case requires; and

      * (b) the rate specified in column 2 of the table in subsection (1) of this section opposite to the description of the kind of incapacity described in column 1 from which the veteran is suffering.

    * (3) If the rate calculated in accordance with subsection (2) in respect of the pension payable to a veteran exceeds:

      * (a) if section 25A applies to the veteran--the rate specified in subsection 24(6); or

      * (b) otherwise--the rate specified in subsection 24(4);

    * the rate must be reduced by the amount of the excess.

    * (4) For the purpose of the application of a table in subsection (1) to and in relation to a veteran:

      * (a) amputation of an arm of a veteran below the elbow shall, if the elbow action is lost as a result of the amputation, be treated as if an arm of the veteran had been amputated above the elbow;

      * (c) amputation of a foot of a veteran shall be treated as amputation of a leg of the veteran below the knee;

      * (d) amputation of a hand of a veteran shall be treated as amputation of an arm of the veteran below the elbow; and

      * (e) a leg, foot, hand or arm that has been rendered permanently and wholly useless shall be treated as having been amputated.

##### 27A  Calculation of arrears of pension

    * (1) This section applies if:

      * (a) a pension becomes payable, or becomes payable at an increased rate, under this Part to a veteran from a date (the **_operative date_**) before the date on which a decision to grant the pension, or to increase the rate of the pension, (the **_decision_**) is made; and

      * (b) the veteran is a member of a couple or was a member of a couple at any time during the period (the **_arrears period_**) between:

       * (i) the operative date; and

       * (ii) immediately before the first pension period during which an instalment of the pension, or an instalment of the pension at the increased rate, is paid to the person; and

      * (c) the veteran's partner was receiving:

       * (i) a social security pension or benefit; or

       * (ia) a service pension; or

       * (ii) income support supplement;

      * at any time during the arrears period; and

      * (d) the rate at which the social security pension or benefit, service pension or income support supplement is payable to the veteran's partner is reduced as a result of the pension becoming payable to the veteran, or becoming payable to the veteran at an increased rate, as the case requires; and

      * (e) an amount (the **_recovered amount_**), or no amount, in respect of that reduction has been deducted under section 205 or section 205AA_._

         * _Note:	The amount of arrears of pension payable to a veteran may also be affected by section 205 or 205AA.

    * (2) The amount of the pension payable to the veteran in respect of the arrears period is reduced by an amount calculated as follows:

Method statement

       * Step 1.	Work out the total amount of the pension that would have been paid to the veteran during the arrears period if the decision had been made on the operative date.

       * Step 2.	Work out the total amount (if any) of the pension that was paid to the veteran during the arrears period.

       * Step 3.	Subtract the amount obtained in Step 2 from the amount obtained in Step 1. The result is called the **_provisional arrears_**.

       * Step 4.	Work out the total amount of social security pension or benefit, service pension or income support supplement that was paid to the veteran's partner during the arrears period.

       * Step 5.	Work out the total amount (if any) of social security pension or benefit, service pension or income support supplement that would have been payable to the veteran's partner during the arrears period if the decision had been made on the operative date.

       * Step 6.	Subtract the amount obtained in step 5 from the amount obtained in step 4. The result is called the **_notional excess payment_**.

       * Step 6A.	Subtract the recovered amount (if any) from the notional excess payment. The result is called the **_excess payment_**.

       * Step 7.	If the excess payment is equal to or more than the provisional arrears, the pension payable to the veteran in respect of the arrears period is reduced by the amount of the provisional arrears.

       * Step 8.	If the excess payment is less than the provisional arrears, the amount of the pension payable to the veteran in respect of the arrears period is reduced by the amount of the excess payment.

##### 27B  Certain decisions under section 27A reviewable under the Social Security Act

      * (a) the vocational, trade and professional skills, qualifications and experience of the veteran;

      * (b) the kinds of remunerative work which a person with the skills, qualifications and experience referred to in paragraph (a) might reasonably undertake; and

### Part IIIAB--Pension bonus

#### Division 1--Introduction

##### 45T  Simplified outline

    * A person may be able to get a single lumpsum **_pension bonus _**if:

         * (a) the person becomes eligible for an age service pension, but defers claiming it; or

         * (b) the person is eligible for a partner service pension after reaching pension age, but defers claiming it; or

         * (c) the person is eligible for income support supplement after reaching qualifying age, but defers claiming it.

     * A person who wants to get a pension bonus must **_register _**as a **_member of the pension bonus scheme_**. An application for registration cannot be made on or after 1 July 2014.

     * To get a pension bonus, a person must accrue between 1 and 5 **_bonus periods_** while deferring age service pension, partner service pension or income support supplement.

     * Generally, a bonus period runs for 1 year.

     * To pass the work test for a year, either the person, or the person's partner, must **_gainfully work_** for at least 960 hours during that year.

     * The amount of a person's pension bonus depends on the number of accrued bonus periods and the person's annual rate of age service pension, partner service pension or income support supplement. A person may get a bigger bonus by accruing more bonus periods.

     * Division 12 modifies the other provisions of the Part to deal with the case where a person was, before becoming a war widow/war widower--pensioner, either registered, or eligible to be registered, as a member of the pension bonus scheme under Part 2.2A of the _Social Security Act 1991_.

      * (d) who has not received age pension under the social security law; and

      * (e) who has not claimed pension bonus under that law before becoming a war widow/war widower--pensioner.

##### 45UW  Commission may request the provision of information

    * The Commission may, by notice in writing, request a person to whom this Division applies to provide to the Commission, within a period specified in the notice, any information that it considers would have been relevant:

      * (a) for the purpose of determining whether the person:

       * (i) was registered as a member of the SSA pension bonus scheme; or

       * (ii) in the opinion of the Commission, could have been so registered before becoming a war widow/war widower--pensioner had the person applied for that registration; and

      * (b) for the purpose of working out the bonus periods that the person would have accrued under the social security law:

       * (i) if the person was registered as a member of the SSA pension bonus scheme--if the person had made a claim for pension bonus under that law immediately before becoming a war widow/war widower--pensioner; and

       * (ii) if the person was not so registered but, in the opinion of the Commission, could have been so registered before becoming a war widow/war widower--pensioner had the person applied for that registration--if the person had been so registered from the earliest day that the person could have been so registered and, immediately before becoming a war widow/war widower--pensioner, had made a claim for pension bonus under that law.

##### 45UX  Commission may determine whether periods occurring before becoming a war widow/war widower--pensioner are bonus periods under the social security law

    * (1) If a person:

      * (a) is a person to whom this Division applies; and

      * (b) was registered as a member of the SSA pension bonus scheme;

    * the Commission may, subject to subsection (3), determine, having regard to information supplied to it under this Act or the social security law, that if:

      * (c) the person had made a claim for pension bonus under that law immediately before becoming a war widow/war widower--pensioner; and

      * (d) the claim had been made in respect of a period the whole or part of which the Commission determines would have been a period of accruing membership of that scheme;

    * that period, or that part of that period, would have accrued to the person as a bonus period under that law.

    * (2) If a person:

      * (a) is a person to whom this Division applies; and

      * (b) was not registered as a member of the SSA pension bonus scheme but, in the opinion of the Commission, could have been so registered before becoming a war widow/war widower--pensioner had the person applied for that registration;

    * the Commission may, subject to subsection (3), determine, having regard to information supplied to it under this Act or the social security law, that if:

      * (c) the person had been so registered from the earliest possible date that the person could have been so registered; and

      * (d) the person had made a claim for pension bonus under that law immediately before becoming a war widow/war widower--pensioner; and

      * (e) the claim had been made in respect of a period the whole or part of which the Commission determines would have been a period of accruing membership of that scheme;

    * that period, or that part of that period, would have accrued to the person as a bonus period under that law.

    * (3) If the Commission determines, in respect of a person to whom this Division applies, that:

      * (a) a period would have been:

       * (i) if the person was registered as a member of the SSA pension bonus scheme--a partyear period of accruing membership of that scheme; or

       * (ii) if the person was not, but, in the opinion of the Commission, could have been so registered before becoming a war widow/war widower--pensioner had the person applied for that registration and had the person been so registered from the earliest possible date that the person could have been so registered--such a partyear period of accruing membership of that scheme; and

      * (b) the period was not immediately preceded by another period that would have accrued to that person as a bonus period under the social security law;

    * the Commission may, despite the terms of subsection 92T(3) of the _Social Security Act 1991_, treat that partyear period as a bonus period under the social security law if, had the person made a claim for pension bonus under that law immediately before becoming a war widow/war widower--pensioner, the person would have passed the work test under that law in respect of that period.

##### 45UY  Modification of provisions of this Part in respect of persons to whom this Division applies

    * (1) For the purposes of working out the amount of the pension bonus payable under this Part to a person to whom this Division applies and subject to subsection (2), if the Commission determines, under section 45UX, that a period would have accrued to the person as a bonus period under the social security law, then:

      * (a) that bonus period is to be treated as if it were a bonus period that had accrued to the person under this Act; and

      * (b) that bonus period, or if more than one, the last such bonus period, is to be treated as if it were continuous with the first bonus period (if any) that accrues to the person under this Act after the person becomes a war widow/war widower--pensioner.

    * (2) Subsection (1) applies in relation to a partyear period that the Commission determines is a bonus period that would have accrued, under the social security law, to a person to whom this Division applies only if:

      * (a) that bonus period is immediately preceded by a period that the Commission determines would have been another bonus period accruing to the person under that law; or

      * (b) that bonus period, when aggregated with any bonus period or bonus periods accruing to the person under this Act after the person becomes a war widow/war widower--pensioner, would amount to at least one year.

    * (3) If:

      * (a) a person to whom this Division applies has a partyear period of accruing membership of the pension bonus scheme under this Act; and

      * (b) the partyear period does not begin immediately after a bonus period accruing to that person under this Act;

    * then, for the purposes of applying subsection 45TR(3) of this Act in determining whether that partyear period is a bonus period under this Act, the Commission may treat that partyear period as if it were immediately preceded by a bonus period accruing to that person under this Act.
