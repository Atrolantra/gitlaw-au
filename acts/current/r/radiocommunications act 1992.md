     * (b) due consideration has been given to any representations so made.

        * Note: This subsection has effect subject to section 163A (which deals with the ACMA's power to make standards in cases of urgency).

    * (2) The ACMA may make an arrangement with any of the following bodies or associations:

     * (a) Standards Australia; 

     * (b) a body or association approved in writing by Standards Australia for the purposes of this subsection;

     * (c) a body or association specified in a written determination made by the ACMA for the purposes of this subsection;

    * under which the body or association: 

     * (d) prepares a draft of a standard; and

     * (e) publishes the draft standard; and

     * (f) undertakes a process of public consultation on the draft standard; and
