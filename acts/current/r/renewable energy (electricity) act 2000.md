     * (b) to reduce emissions of greenhouse gases in the electricity sector; and

     * (c) to ensure that renewable energy sources are ecologically sustainable.

    * This is done through the issuing of certificates for the generation of electricity using eligible renewable energy sources and requiring certain purchasers (called **_liable entities_**) to surrender a specified number of certificates for the electricity that they acquire during a year.

    * Where a liable entity does not have enough certificates to surrender, the liable entity will have to pay renewable energy shortfall charge.

    * A partial exemption relating to one or more emissionsintensive tradeexposed activities may be taken into account in working out a liable entity's renewable energy certificate shortfall for a year. If it is, it will reduce the renewable energy shortfall charge otherwise payable.

##### 4  Years to which this Act applies

    * This Act applies to the year commencing on 1 January 2001 and to all subsequent years. However, no certificates can be created, and no liability arises, in respect of electricity generated on or after 1 January 2031.

##### 8  Overview of Part

    * This Part provides for the creation, trading and extinguishing of renewable energy certificates.

    * There are 2 types of renewable energy certificates: 

        * (a) largescale generation certificates, which are created in relation to the generation of electricity by accredited power stations; and

        * (b) smallscale technology certificates, which are created in relation to the installation of solar water heaters and small generation units.

    * The certificates are used to avoid or reduce the amount of renewable energy shortfall charge that liable entities who acquire electricity have to pay. The liable entities will generally acquire the certificates by purchasing them.

    * The certificates are created by people who generate power from accredited power stations using eligible energy sources where the amount generated exceeds the relevant 1997 eligible renewable power base line. The certificates are also created for approved installations of solar water heaters or small generation units.

    * A person needs to be registered under Division 2 before they can create a certificate.

    * Division 2A provides for provisional accreditation of power stations.

    * A power station needs to be accredited under Division 3 before a certificate can be issued in relation to power generated by it.

    * A certificate must be registered when it is created. Every transfer of the certificate must also be registered.

    * When a certificate has been surrendered by a liable party, it ceases to be valid.

    * See also Part 2A (clearing house for smallscale technology certificates), which:

        * (a) provides a clearing house facility for the transfer of smallscale technology certificates; and

        * (b) gives the Regulator a limited power to create or cancel smallscale technology certificates.

### Part 3--Acquisition of electricity

##### 31  What are relevant acquisitions?

    * (1) There are 2 types of **_relevant acquisitions_** of electricity. These are:

     * (a) a wholesale acquisition (see section 32); and

     * (b) a notional wholesale acquisition (see section 33).

    * (2) An acquisition is not a relevant acquisition if:

     * (a) the electricity was delivered on a grid that has a capacity that is less than 100 MW and that is not, directly or indirectly, connected to a grid that has a capacity of 100 MW or more; or

     * (b) the end user of the electricity generated the electricity and either of the following conditions are satisfied:

      * (i) the point at which the electricity is generated is less than 1 kilometre from the point at which the electricity is used;

      * (ii) the electricity is transmitted or distributed between the point of generation and the point of use and the line on which the electricity is transmitted or distributed is used solely for the transmission or distribution of electricity between those 2 points; or

     * (c) the electricity is later acquired by AEMO or a person or body prescribed by the regulations.

    * (3) The amount of electricity acquired under a relevant acquisition and the capacity of a grid are to be determined in accordance with the regulations.

    * (4) A person who owns, operates or controls a grid must give the Regulator a statement within 28 days of either of the following happening:

     * (a) the capacity of the grid increases from less than 100 MW to 100 MW or more;

     * (b) the grid becomes connected, directly or indirectly, to a grid that has a capacity of 100 MW or more.

    * The statement must include any information specified in the regulations.

##### 32  Wholesale acquisitions

    * (1) A **_wholesale acquisition_** is an acquisition of electricity from:

     * (a) AEMO or a person or body prescribed by the regulations; or

     * (b) a person who did not acquire it from another person.

    * (2) To avoid doubt, subsection (1) does not apply where an end user acquires electricity from the person who generated the electricity and subsection 33(2) applies to create a notional wholesale acquisition in connection with that acquisition.

    * (3) If there is a wholesale acquisition of electricity under this section, then no other acquisition in relation to that electricity is a relevant acquisition (regardless of when the other acquisition occurs).

##### 33  Notional wholesale acquisitions

    * (1) There are 2 situations in which a **_notional wholesale acquisition_** of electricity takes place.

    * (2) The first situation is where the end user of the electricity acquires the electricity from the person who generated the electricity and the end user is not registered under the National Electricity Rules. In this situation, the person who generated the electricity is taken to be 2 persons (the **_notional generator_** and the **_notional wholesaler_**), and this Act applies as if the notional wholesaler acquired the electricity from the notional generator at the time that the end user acquired the electricity. That acquisition is a **_notional wholesale acquisition_**.

    * (3) The second situation is where the end user of the electricity generated the electricity and neither of the following conditions are satisfied:

     * (a) the point at which the electricity is generated is less than 1 kilometre from the point at which the electricity is used;

     * (b) the electricity is transmitted or distributed between the point of generation and the point of use and the line on which the electricity is transmitted or distributed is used solely for the transmission or distribution of electricity between those 2 points.

    * In this situation, the person who generated the electricity is taken to be 2 persons (the **_notional generator_** and the **_notional wholesaler_**), and this Act applies as if the notional wholesaler acquired the electricity from the notional generator at the time that the electricity is used. That acquisition is a **_notional wholesale acquisition_**.

##### 34  Special provision relating to transactions involving AEMO or a person or body prescribed by the regulations

    * Despite section 31, no acquisition of electricity by AEMO or a person or body prescribed by the regulations is a relevant acquisition.

    * (1) Subject to subsection (2), if a liable entity has a largescale generation shortfall for a year, **_largescale generation shortfall charge_** is payable in respect of the shortfall.

    * (2) No largescale generation shortfall charge is payable by a liable entity for a year if its largescale generation shortfall for the year is less than 10% of the liable entity's required largescale renewable energy for the year. However, the largescale generation shortfall becomes a **_carried forward shortfall_** for the year.

    * (3) Largescale generation shortfall charge imposed in respect of a liable entity's largescale generation shortfall for a year is payable by the liable entity.

        * Note: Largescale generation shortfall charge is imposed by the _Renewable Energy (Electricity) (Largescale Generation Shortfall Charge) Act 2000_.

##### 37  Amount of charge

    * The amount of largescale generation shortfall charge payable by a liable entity is worked out using the formula: 

    * where: 

    * **_rate of charge_** is the rate of charge as specified in section 6 of the _Renewable Energy (Electricity) (Largescale Generation Shortfall Charge) Act 2000_.

##### 38  Determination of largescale generation shortfall

    * The following method statement shows how to work out a liable entity's**_ largescale generation shortfall_** for a year:

Method statement

      * Step 1.	Work out the total amount, in MWh, of electricity acquired by the liable entity during the year under relevant acquisitions.

      * Step 2.	Subtract from the total electricity acquired the amount of the liable entity's partial exemption for the year.

      * Step 3.	Multiply the result of step 2 by the renewable power percentage for the year and round the result to the nearest MWh (rounding 0.5 upwards). Add to the result any carried forward shortfall from the previous year or subtract any carried forward surplus for the previous year. The result is the liable entity's **_required largescale renewable energy_** for the year.

      * Step 4.	Subtract the total value, in MWh, of largescale generation certificates surrendered for that year, under Subdivision A of Division 1 of Part 5, by the liable entity from the required largescale renewable energy for the year.

      * Result: If the result is greater than zero, the liable entity has a largescale generation shortfall for the year equal to the result.

      * If the result is zero, the liable entity does not have a largescale generation shortfall for the year.

      * If the result is less than zero, the liable entity has a **_carried forward surplus_** for the year equal to the result (expressed as a positive).

##### Subdivision C--Smallscale technology shortfall charge

##### 38AA  Interpretive provisions relating to liability for smallscale technology shortfall charge etc.

    * (1) This section defines expressions that are used in provisions that deal with the determination of a liable entity's liability to smallscale technology shortfall charge for a year (the **_assessment year_**), and related matters.

    * Assessment year's reduced acquisitions

    * (2) The **_assessment year's reduced acquisitions_** is the amount worked out by subtracting the amount of the liable entity's partial exemption (if any) for the assessment year from the total amount, in MWh, of electricity acquired during the assessment year by the liable entity under relevant acquisitions.

    * Previous year's reduced acquisitions

    * (3) The **_previous year's reduced acquisitions_** is the amount worked out by subtracting the amount of the liable entity's partial exemption (if any) for the previous year from the amount, in MWh, of electricity acquired by the liable entity during the previous year under relevant acquisitions.

    * (4) For the purpose of subsection (3):

     * (a) the amount, in MWh, of electricity acquired during the previous year by the liable entity under relevant acquisitions is taken to be the amount stated as having been so acquired in the liable entity's energy acquisition statement for the previous year (taking account of any amendments to that statement that were made before 1 April in the assessment year); and

     * (b) the amount of the liable entity's partial exemption for the previous year is taken to be the total amount of partial exemption claimed in the liable entity's energy acquisition statement for the previous year (taking account of any amendments to that statement that were made before 1 April in the assessment year); and

     * (c) if, for any reason, the liable entity has not lodged an energy acquisition statement for the previous year before 1 April in the assessment year, the liable entity is taken not to have any previous year's reduced acquisitions.

        * Note: If paragraph (4)(c) applies, the liable entity may make an application under section 38AG to have an amount apply as if it were the previous year's reduced acquisitions. If the entity does not do so, the default rule in section 38AH will apply.

    * The quarters of a year

    * (5) Each year consists of **_quarters_** as follows:

    * (3) The following method statement shows how to work out a liable entity's quarterly shortfall for the third quarter of the assessment year.

Method statement

      * Step 1.	Work out 25% of the previous year's reduced acquisitions. Multiply this by the smallscale technology percentage for the assessment year and round the result to the nearest MWh (rounding 0.5 upwards). The result is the **_required surrender amount_**.

      * Step 2.	Add together:

        * (a) the total value, in MWh, of smallscale technology certificates surrendered, under Subdivision A of Division 1 of Part 5, by the liable entity during the surrender period for the third quarter; and

        * (b) the amount of any quarterly surplus that the liable entity has for the second quarter of the assessment year.

      * The result is the **_surrendered amount_**.

      * Step 3.	Subtract the surrendered amount from the required surrender amount.

      * Result: If the result is greater than zero, the liable entity has a **_quarterly shortfall _**for the third quarter of the assessment year equal to the result.

      * If the result is zero, the liable entity does not have a quarterly shortfall for the third quarter of the assessment year.

      * If the result is less than zero, the liable entity has a **_quarterly surplus_** for the third quarter of the assessment year equal to the result (expressed as a positive).

    * Fourth quarter of the assessment year

    * (4) The following method statement shows how to work out a liable entity's quarterly shortfall for the fourth quarter of the assessment year.

Method statement

      * Step 1.	Work out the assessment year's reduced acquisitions. Multiply this by the smallscale technology percentage for the assessment year and round the result to the nearest MWh (rounding 0.5 upwards).

      * Step 2.	Subtract from the amount worked out under step 1 the total of the required surrender amounts for the first, second and third quarters of the assessment year. The result (which may be less than zero) is the **_required surrender amount_**.

      * Step 3.	Add together:

        * (a) the total value, in MWh, of smallscale technology certificates surrendered, under Subdivision A of Division 1 of Part 5, by the liable entity during the surrender period for the fourth quarter; and

        * (b) the amount of any quarterly surplus that the liable entity has for the third quarter of the assessment year.

      * The result is the **_surrendered amount_**.

      * Step 4.	If the required surrender amount is zero or greater, subtract the surrendered amount from the required surrender amount.

      * Result: If the result is greater than zero, the liable entity has a **_quarterly shortfall_** for the fourth quarter of the assessment year equal to the result.

      * If the result is zero, the liable entity does not have a quarterly shortfall for the fourth quarter of the assessment year.

      * If the result is less than zero, the liable entity has a **_quarterly surplus_** for the fourth quarter of the assessment year equal to the result (expressed as a positive amount).

      * Step 5.	If the required surrender amount is less than zero, add together that amount (expressed as a positive) to the surrendered amount.

      * Result: The liable entity has a **_quarterly surplus_** for the fourth quarter of the assessment year equal to the result.
