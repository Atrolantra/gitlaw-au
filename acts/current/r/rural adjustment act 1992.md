    * (2) In order to achieve those objectives, this Act is intended:

     * (a) to promote a better financial, technical and management performance from the farm sector; and

     * (b) to provide support, either directly or indirectly, to farmers who have prospects of sustainable long-term profitability with a view to improving the productivity of their farm units; and

     * (c) in the case of direct support to farmers--to provide that support in a way that ensures that the farmers who are supported become financially independent of that support within a reasonable period; and

     * (d) to provide that support through, but not limited to:

      * (i) grants for the purposes of subsidies for interest payable on, and associated costs of, loans, whether the loans are provided by a State or by another person; and

      * (ii) grants for the purposes of farm training, planning, appraisal, support services and rural adjustment research; and

     * (e) to support farmers who do not have prospects of sustainable long-term profitability to leave the farm sector; and
