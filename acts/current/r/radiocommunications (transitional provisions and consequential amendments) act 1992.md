### An Act to repeal the Radiocommunications Act 1983 and certain related Acts, and to make transitional provisions and certain amendments consequential upon the enactment of the Radiocommunications Act 1992

### Part 1--Preliminary

##### 1  Short title

    * This Act may be cited as the _Radiocommunications (Transitional Provisions and Consequential Amendments) Act 1992_.

##### 2  Commencement

    * This Act commences on 1 July 1993.

### Part 2--Transitional provisions

##### 3  Interpretation

    * (1) In this Part, unless the contrary intention appears:

    * **_old Act_** means the _Radiocommunications Act 1983_.

    * **_new Act_** means the _Radiocommunications Act 1992_.

    * (2) Subject to subsection (3), terms and expressions used in this Part have the same meaning as they have in the new Act.

    * (3) Terms and expressions used in this Part that relate to the old Act or anything done under the old Act have the same meaning as they have in the old Act.

##### 4  Saving of instruments under the old Act

    * Subject to section 5, if an instrument is made by the Minister that:

     * (a) is an instrument of a kind referred to in column 2 of the following table; and

     * (b) was in force immediately before the commencement of this Act;

    * then the instrument: 

     * (c) continues in force immediately after that commencement as if, at the time it had been made, it had been made, in the same terms, by the SMA as an instrument of the kind referred to in the corresponding item in column 3 of the following table; and

     * (d) is taken, for all purposes, to have been issued by the SMA as such an instrument.

##### 5  Instruments subject to suspension

    * If, immediately before the commencement of this Act:

     * (a) a compliance statement certificate issued under section 12 of the old Act is the subject of suspension under section 13 of the old Act; or

     * (b) a transmitter licence granted under section 24 or 24B of the old Act is the subject of suspension under section 28 of the old Act;

    * section 4 of this Act does not apply to the certificate or licence until the suspension ceases to have effect (otherwise than because of the expiry or cancellation of the certificate or licence).

##### 6  Authorities under transmitter licences

    * An authority given by a person, under section 26 of the old Act, that was in force immediately before the commencement of this Act continues in force immediately after that commencement as if it had been an authorisation given by that person under section 114 of the new Act.

##### 7  Frequency reservation certificates

    * (1) Subject to subsection (4), despite the repeal of the old Act by section 13 of this Act, a frequency reservation certificate granted under section 21 of the old Act that was in force immediately before the commencement of this Act remains in force after that commencement for the period for which it would have remained in force if the old Act were not repealed.

    * (2) If an unallocated frequency is reserved in the name of a person in accordance with a frequency reservation certificate in force under subsection (1), the SMA must not issue to a person other than that person a permit or transmitter licence authorising the operation of a transmitter in a manner inconsistent with that reservation.

    * (3) For the purposes of subsection (2), issuing a permit or transmitter licence that authorises the operation of a transmitter for a period not exceeding 14 days is taken to be not inconsistent with a reservation.

    * (4) The SMA has the same power to cancel a frequency reservation certificate to which subsection (1) applies as the Minister had, immediately before the commencement of this Act, to cancel frequency reservation certificates.

##### 11  Regulations under the Radiocommunications Act

    * (1) Subject to subsection (3), any regulations made under the old Act and in force immediately before the commencement of this Act continue in force as if made under the new Act.

    * (2) A reference in a regulation so continued in force to a provision of the old Act is taken to be a reference to the corresponding provision in the new Act.

    * (3) This section does not apply to a regulation the making of which would not be authorised by the new Act.

### Part 3--Repeal and consequential amendments

##### 14  Consequential amendments of Acts

    * (2) References in subsection 362(4) of the _Commonwealth Electoral Act 1918_ as amended by this Act, and in section 108A of the _Referendum (Machinery Provisions) Act 1984_ as so amended, to contraventions of the _Radiocommunications Act 1992_ are taken to include references to contraventions of the _Radiocommunications Act 1983_ that took place before the commencement of this Act.

    * (3) Without limiting the application of section 4 of this Act:

     * (a) a reference in subparagraphs 91(a)(iii) and (c)(iii) of the _Copyright Act 1968_, as amended by this Act, to a transmitter licence issued under the _Radiocommunications Act 1992_;

    * is taken to include: 

     * (b) a reference to a transmitter licence or a temporary permit that, although not in force immediately before the commencement of this Act, was in force at the time when the broadcast in question was made.
