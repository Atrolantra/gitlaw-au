    * Civil penalty orders may be sought from a court in relation to contraventions of civil penalty provisions.

    * This Part also contains some rules of general application in relation to civil penalty provisions (such as the state of mind that must be proved and the defence of mistake of fact).

##### 78  Purposes and operation of this Part

    * (1) The principal purposes of this Part are to create a framework for the use of civil penalties to enforce civil penalty provisions.

    * (2) However, for this Part to operate, a civil penalty provision must be made enforceable under this Part.

##### 79  Enforceable civil penalty provisions

      * (ii) a subregulation, or a regulation that is not divided into subregulations; or

      * (iii) a subclause (however described) of a Schedule to an Act or of a legislative instrument; or

      * (iv) a clause (however described) of a Schedule to an Act, or of a legislative instrument, that is not divided into subclauses.

##### 80  Authorised applicant

    * (1) A person is an **_authorised applicant_** for the purposes of exercising powers under this Part in relation to the contravention of a civil penalty provision if an Act provides that the person is an authorised applicant in relation to the civil penalty provision for the purposes of this Part.

    * (2) A person who is an **_authorised applicant_** for the purpose of exercising powers mentioned in subsection (1) is also an **_authorised applicant_** for the purposes of:

     * (a) exercising other powers under this Part; or

     * (b) performing functions or duties under this Part;

    * that are incidental to the powers mentioned in subsection (1).

    * (3) Without limiting subsection (1), an Act may provide that a person is an authorised applicant in relation to a civil penalty provision for the purposes of this Part by:

     * (b) authorising another person to specify that a person, or a person of a specified class, is an authorised applicant in relation to the civil penalty provision for those purposes.

##### 81  Relevant court

    * A court is a **_relevant court_** for the purposes of exercising powers under this Part in relation to the contravention of a civil penalty provision, if an Act provides that the court is a relevant court in relation to the civil penalty provision for the purposes of this Part.

    * (3) If the relevant court is satisfied that the person has contravened the civil penalty provision, the court may order the person to pay to the Commonwealth such pecuniary penalty for the contravention as the court determines to be appropriate.

        * Note: Subsection (5) sets out the maximum penalty that the court may order the person to pay.

    * (4) An order under subsection (3) is a **_civil penalty order_**.

##### 85  Multiple contraventions

    * (1) A relevant court may make a single civil penalty order against a person for multiple contraventions of a civil penalty provision if proceedings for the contraventions are founded on the same facts, or if the contraventions form, or are part of, a series of contraventions of the same or a similar character.

        * Note: For continuing contraventions of civil penalty provisions, see section 93.

    * (2) However, the penalty must not exceed the sum of the maximum penalties that could be ordered if a separate penalty were ordered for each of the contraventions.

     * (a) the civil proceedings are dismissed; and

     * _	_(b)	costs must not be awarded in relation to the civil proceedings.

##### 90  Criminal proceedings after civil proceedings

    * Criminal proceedings may be commenced against a person for conduct that is the same, or substantially the same, as conduct that would constitute a contravention of a civil penalty provision regardless of whether a civil penalty order has been made against the person in relation to the contravention.

##### 91  Evidence given in civil proceedings not admissible in criminal proceedings

    * (1) Evidence of information given, or evidence of production of documents, by an individual is not admissible in criminal proceedings against the individual if:

    * (1) A person is not liable to have a civil penalty order made against the person for a contravention of a civil penalty provision if:

     * (a) at or before the time of the conduct constituting the contravention, the person:

      * (i) considered whether or not facts existed; and

      * (ii) was under a mistaken but reasonable belief about those facts; and

     * (b) had those facts existed, the conduct would not have constituted a contravention of the civil penalty provision.

    * (2) For the purposes of subsection (1), a person may be regarded as having considered whether or not facts existed if:

     * (b) performing functions or duties under this Part;

    * that are incidental to the powers mentioned in subsection (1).

    * (3) Without limiting subsection (1), an Act may provide that a person is an infringement officer in relation to a provision for the purposes of this Part by:

    * (2) The infringement notice must be given within 12 months after the day on which the contravention is alleged to have taken place.

    * (3) A single infringement notice must relate only to a single contravention of a single provision unless subsection (4) applies.

    * (4) An infringement officer may give a person a single infringement notice relating to multiple contraventions of a single provision if:
