##### 11  Interaction of enforceable instruments with State and Territory laws

    * An enforceable instrument prevails over a law of a State or Territory, to the extent of any inconsistency.

##### 12  Interaction of enforceable instruments with other Commonwealth instruments (employees)

    * (1) A term of a modern award, an enterprise agreement, an FWC order or a transitional instrument has no effect in relation to a road transport driver to whom an enforceable instrument applies to the extent that the award, agreement, order or instrument is less beneficial to the driver than a term of the enforceable instrument.

    * (2) In this Act:

    * **_enterprise agreement _**means an enterprise agreement made under the _Fair Work Act 2009._

    * For the purposes of paragraph 15(1)(d) of the _Independent Contractors Act 2006_, an enforceable instrument that applies to a road transport driver whose services contract is being reviewed under that Act is a matter the Court under that Act might (but is not required to) think relevant.

##### Subdivision B--Miscellaneous

##### 15  Act binds Crown

    * (1) This Act binds the Crown in each of its capacities.

    * (2) However, this Act does not make the Crown liable to be prosecuted for an offence.

    * (3) To avoid doubt, subsection (2) does not prevent the Crown from being liable to pay a pecuniary penalty under section 50.

##### 16  Act not to apply so as to exceed Commonwealth power

    * (1) Unless the contrary intention appears, if a provision of this Act:

     * (a) would, apart from this section, have an application (an **_invalid application_**) in relation to:

      * (i) one or more particular persons, things, matters, places, circumstances or cases; or

      * (ii) one or more classes (however defined or determined) of persons, things, matters, places, circumstances or cases;

     * because of which the provision exceeds the Commonwealth's legislative power; and

     * (b) also has at least one application (a **_valid application_**) in relation to:

      * (i) one or more particular persons, things, matters, places, circumstances or cases; or

      * (ii) one or more classes (however defined or determined) of persons, things, matters, places, circumstances or cases;

     * that, if it were the provision's only application, would be within the Commonwealth's legislative power;

    * it is the Parliament's intention that the provision is not to have the invalid application, but is to have every valid application.

    * (2) Despite subsection (1), the provision is not to have a particular valid application if:

     * (a) apart from this section, it is clear, taking into account the provision's context and the purpose or object underlying this Act, that the provision was intended to have that valid application only if every invalid application, or a particular invalid application, of the provision had also been within the Commonwealth's legislative power; or

     * (b) the provision's operation in relation to that valid application would be different in a substantial respect from what would have been its operation in relation to that valid application if every invalid application of the provision had been within the Commonwealth's legislative power.

    * (3) Subsection (2) does not limit the cases where a contrary intention may be taken to appear for the purposes of subsection (1).

    * (4) This section applies to a provision of this Act, whether enacted before, at or after the commencement of this section.

##### 17  Acquisition of property

    * This Act, or any instrument made under this Act, does not apply to the extent that the operation of this Act or the instrument would result in an acquisition of property (within the meaning of paragraph 51(xxxi) of the Constitution) from a person otherwise than on just terms (within the meaning of that paragraph).

### Part 3--Approval of certain collective agreements involving contractor drivers

##### 32A  Power to approve road transport collective agreements

    * (1) The Tribunal may approve a road transport collective agreement under this Part.

    * (2) In deciding whether to approve a road transport collective agreement, the Tribunal may have regard to whether the benefit of approving the agreement would outweigh the detriment to the public constituted by any lessening of competition that would result, or be likely to result, if the Tribunal approved the agreement.

##### 33  Road transport collective agreements

    * (1) A **_road transport collective agreement_** is an agreement:

     * (a) between:

      * (i) contractor drivers (the **_participating drivers_**) with whom a hirer or potential hirer proposes to contract for the provision of specified road transport services (the **_applicable services_**); and

      * (ii) the hirer or potential hirer of the drivers (the **_participating hirer_**); and

     * (b) that specifies:

      * (i) who the participating hirer is; and

      * (ii) who the participating drivers are; and

      * (iii) the basis on which the participating drivers became part of that group of drivers; and

     * (c) that specifies remuneration or related conditions (or both) for participating drivers who provide applicable services to the participating hirer.

         * Note: If the Tribunal approves the agreement, its effect is not limited to participating drivers: see section 36.

    * (2) However, an agreement made under any of the following laws is not a **_road transport collective agreement_**:

     * (a) Chapter 6 of the _Industrial Relations Act 1996_ of New South Wales (and any other provision of that Act to the extent that it relates to, or has effect for the purposes of, a provision of Chapter 6);

     * (b) the _Owner Drivers and Forestry Contractors Act 2005_ of Victoria;

     * (c) the _OwnerDrivers (Contracts and Disputes) Act 2007_ of Western Australia;

     * (d) a law of a State or Territory that is specified in regulations made for the purposes of this paragraph, to the extent that the law is so specified.

    * (3) The regulations may prescribe a code of conduct in relation to collective bargaining for road transport collective agreements.

    * (4) Before the GovernorGeneral makes a regulation under subsection (3), the Minister must consult with industry and the Tribunal.

    * (5) A code of conduct prescribed under subsection (3) must have as its object the facilitation of effective and efficient collective bargaining for road transport collective agreements.

    * (6) Despite any other law of the Commonwealth, a State or a Territory, a road transport collective agreement has no effect unless it is an approved road transport collective agreement.

        * Note: Subsection (6) does not affect agreements made under any of the laws mentioned in subsection (2), as they are not road transport collective agreements.

##### 34  Matters about which the Tribunal must be satisfied

    * The Tribunal must not approve a road transport collective agreement unless the Tribunal is satisfied that: 

     * (a) a road safety remuneration order that applies to the participating drivers is in effect; and

     * (b) a majority of the participating drivers would be better off overall when providing applicable services if the agreement applied than if the order applied; and

     * (c) a majority of the participating drivers have approved the agreement; and

     * (ca) the participating hirer and the participating drivers have conducted themselves in accordance with any code of conduct prescribed under subsection 33(3); and

     * (d) if the agreement is to last for more than one year--the agreement contains an appropriate method for adjusting remuneration during the period of the agreement.

##### 35  Approval of road transport collective agreements

    * (1) If the Tribunal approves a road transport collective agreement, the Tribunal must state in writing that the Tribunal is satisfied that the remuneration and any related conditions in the agreement are adequate to ensure that contractor drivers do not have remunerationrelated incentives to work in an unsafe manner.

    * (2) The statement under subsection (1) must also:

     * (a) specify the participating hirer; and

     * (b) specify the remuneration (including any method for adjusting remuneration during the period of the agreement) and any related conditions in the agreement; and

     * (c) specify the applicable services; and

     * (d) state that the participating hirer is required to provide at least the specified remuneration and related conditions to any contractor driver providing applicable services to the hirer; and

     * (e) specify an expiry date for the approval (which must not be more than 4 years from the date of the statement).

    * (3) The Tribunal must:

     * (a) give a copy of the statement to the participating hirer and each of the participating drivers; and

     * (b) publish the statement on the Tribunal's website and by any other means the Tribunal considers appropriate.

##### 36  Effect of approval

    * (1) The participating hirer in relation to an approved road transport collective agreement must not provide remuneration or related conditions, to a contractor driver who is providing applicable services to the participating hirer, that are less beneficial than the remuneration or related conditions specified in the agreement.

        * Note: This subsection is a civil remedy provision (see Division 1 of Part 5).

    * (2) Subsection (1) applies in relation to a contractor driver regardless of whether the driver was a participating driver in relation to the agreement.

##### 37  Relationship with road safety remuneration orders

    * (1) A road safety remuneration order that is in effect at the time the Tribunal approves a road transport collective agreement has no effect in relation to a contractor driver who provides applicable services to the participating hirer.

    * (2) If a road safety remuneration order takes effect after the Tribunal approves a road transport collective agreement, the agreement ceases to have effect in relation to a contractor driver to the extent that the remuneration or related conditions specified in the agreement are less beneficial to the driver than a term of the order that applies to the driver.
