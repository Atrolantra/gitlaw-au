### Part 9--Facility to pay benefits to eligible rollover funds

##### 87  Object of Part

    * The object of this Part is to provide for a facility for the payment of benefits to eligible rollover funds.

##### 88  Interpretation

    * In this Part: 

    * **_eligible rollover fund_** has the same meaning as in the _Superannuation Industry (Supervision) Act 1993_.

##### 89  Payment of benefits to eligible rollover fund

    * When section applies

    * (1) This section applies at a particular time if the conditions specified in the regulations are satisfied.

    * Application to eligible rollover fund

    * (2) The RSA provider may apply to the trustee of an eligible rollover fund, on behalf of the holder of an RSA, for the issue to the holder of a superannuation interest in the eligible rollover fund.

    * Consideration for issue

    * (3) The application is to be made on the basis that:

     * (a) the consideration for the issue is to be paid, on behalf of the holder, by the RSA provider; and

     * (b) the amount of the consideration is equal to the amount ascertained in accordance with the regulations; and

     * (c) the RSA provider is not entitled to recover the consideration from the holder (except as a result of the operation of subsection (5)).

    * Authorisation by holder

    * (4) The holder is taken to have authorised the RSA provider:

     * (a) to make the application; and

     * (b) to pay the consideration.

    * This rule has effect despite any direction to the contrary by the holder.

    * RSA holder ceases to have rights against RSA provider etc.

    * (5) If the superannuation interest is issued in accordance with the application:

     * (a) the holder ceases to have rights against the RSA provider; and

     * (b) if:

      * (i) immediately before the interest was issued in accordance with the application, another person had a contingent right against the RSA provider to a death or disability benefit; and

      * (ii) the contingent right was derived from the holder's capacity as the holder of an RSA provided by the RSA provider;

    * the other person ceases to have the contingent right against the RSA provider.

        * Note: To avoid doubt, a reference in paragraph (a) to a right against the RSA provider includes a reference to a contingent right to a death or disability benefit.

    * Terms and conditions overridden

    * (6) This section has effect despite anything in the terms and conditions of the RSA.

##### 90  Operating standards for RSA providers--information and records

    * When section applies

##### 143A  Effect of mistaken quotation of tax file number

    * (1) The Commissioner of Taxation (the **_Commissioner_**) may give an RSA provider notice of the tax file number of the holder of an RSA if:

     * (a) the provider has made a record of a number (the **_recorded TFN_**) the provider believes to be the tax file number of the holder; and

     * (b) the Commissioner is satisfied that the recorded TFN:

      * (i) has been cancelled or withdrawn since it was quoted; or

      * (ii) is otherwise wrong; and

     * (c) the Commissioner is satisfied that the holder has a tax file number.

    * (2) The holder is taken to have quoted his or her tax file number to the provider in connection with the operation or the possible future operation of this Act and the other Superannuation Acts at a time if:

     * (a) the Commissioner gives the provider a notice under subsection (1); and

     * (b) had the recorded TFN been the tax file number of the holder, the holder would have quoted his or her tax file number to the trustee in that way at the time.

##### 143B  Effect of invalid quotation of tax file number

    * (1) The Commissioner of Taxation (the **_Commissioner_**) may give an RSA provider a notice under subsection (2) if:

      * (ii) is otherwise wrong; and

     * (c) the Commissioner is not satisfied that the holder has a tax file number.

     * (a) the notice is to be disregarded; and

     * (b) section 140A does not apply to deem the person to have quoted the tax file number to the provider when the notice was given.
