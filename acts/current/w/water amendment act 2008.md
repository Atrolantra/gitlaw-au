##### 2  After Part 2

    * Insert: 

### Part 2A--Critical human water needs

##### 86A  Critical human water needs to be taken into account in developing Basin Plan

      * (1) Without limiting section 21, the Basin Plan must be prepared having regard to the fact that the Commonwealth and the Basin States have agreed:

        * (a) that critical human water needs are the highest priority water use for communities who are dependent on Basin water resources; and

        * (b) in particular that, to give effect to this priority in the River Murray System, conveyance water will receive first priority from the water available in the system.

      * (2) **_Critical human water needs_** are the needs for a minimum amount of water, that can only reasonably be provided from Basin water resources, required to meet:

        * (a) core human consumption requirements in urban and rural areas; and

        * (b) those non-human consumption requirements that a failure to meet would cause prohibitively high social, economic or national security costs.

      * (3) The **_River Murray System_** is the aggregate of:

        * (a) the main course of the River Murray upstream of the eastern boundary of South Australia; and

        * (b) all tributaries entering that part of the main course upstream of Doctors Point (near Albury); and

        * (c) all effluents and anabranches of that part of the main course; and

        * (d) the watercourses connecting Lake Victoria to the main course; and

        * (e) the Darling River downstream of the Menindee Lakes Storage; and

        * (f) the upper River Murray storages, namely:

          * (i) Lake Victoria; and

          * (ii) the Menindee Lakes Storage; and

          * (iii) the storages formed by Dartmouth Dam and Hume Dam; and

          * (iv) the storages formed by the weirs, and weirs and locks, described in Schedule A to the Agreement that are upstream of the eastern boundary of South Australia; and

        * (g) the River Murray in South Australia.

      * (4) **_Conveyance water_** is water in the River Murray System required to deliver water to meet critical human water needs as far downstream as Wellington in South Australia.

##### 86B  Basin Plan to provide for critical human water needs

      * (1) The Basin Plan must:

        * (a) include a statement of the amount of water required in each Basin State that is a referring State (other than Queensland) to meet the critical human water needs of the communities in the State that are dependent on the waters of the River Murray System; and

        * (b) include a statement of the amount of conveyance water required to deliver the water referred to in paragraph (a); and

        * (c) specify water quality trigger points and salinity trigger points at which water in the River Murray System becomes unsuitable for meeting critical human water needs.

      * (2) The reference in paragraph (1)(a) to communities in a Basin State who are dependent on the waters of the River Murray System does not include a reference to communities dependent on the waters of the Edward-Wakool System downstream of Stevens Weir.

##### 86C  Additional matters relating to monitoring, assessment and risk management

      * (1) The Basin Plan must also specify:

        * (a) arrangements for monitoring matters relevant to critical human water needs, including monitoring the quality, quantity and flows of surface water, the health of ecosystems and social impacts on communities; and

        * (b) the process for assessing, and managing risks to critical human water needs associated with, inflow prediction:

          * (i) in the River Murray System; and

          * (ii) in relation to works that are under the control of the body that is entitled, under the _Snowy Hydro Corporatisation Act 1997_ of New South Wales, to the Snowy water licence within the meaning of that Act; and

        * (c) the risk management approach for inter-annual planning relating to arrangements for critical human water needs in future years.

      * (2) The risk management approach referred to in paragraph (1)(c) must address the making of decisions about whether water is:

        * (a) made available, in a particular year, for uses other than meeting critical human water needs; or

        * (b) set aside for critical human water needs in future years.

##### 86D  Additional matters relating to Tier 2 water sharing arrangements

      * (1) The Basin Plan must also:

        * (a) specify the conditions under which, due to the likelihood that the State water sharing arrangements that would apply but for this Part (**_Tier 1 water sharing arrangements_**) will not ensure that there is enough water to meet conveyance water needs:

          * (i) the Tier 1 water sharing arrangements cease to apply; and

          * (ii) other State water sharing arrangements (**_Tier 2 water sharing arrangements_**), provided for in the Agreement, commence; and

        * (b) specify the conditions under which Tier 2 water sharing arrangements cease to apply and Tier 1 water sharing arrangements recommence; and

        * (c) include a reserves policy that, for periods during which Tier 2 water sharing arrangements apply:

          * (i) specifies the annual volume of water required to be reserved to meet the shortfall in conveyance water worked out under subsection (2); and

          * (ii) specifies the extent to which this volume may vary between years; and

          * (iii) specifies the arrangements that are to apply to ensure that the volume of water required to meet the shortfall in conveyance water will be reserved and provided; and

          * (iv) takes into account the potential inputs from the Murrumbidgee, Darling and Goulburn Rivers; and

        * (d) specify arrangements for carrying water over in storage from one year to another for New South Wales, Victoria and South Australia; and

        * (e) provide for any other matters necessary to give effect to arrangements for sharing water in the River Murray System and in the Murrumbidgee, Darling and Goulburn Rivers in order to provide conveyance water.

      * (2) The shortfall in conveyance water is worked out for the purposes of subparagraph (1)(c)(i) by subtracting:

        * (a) the amount of conveyance water referred to in paragraph 86B(1)(b); from

        * (b) the minimum inflow sequence to the River Murray System from:

          * (i) natural flows; and

          * (ii) works that are under the control of the body that is entitled, under the _Snowy Hydro Corporatisation Act 1997_ of New South Wales, to the Snowy water licence within the meaning of that Act.

      * (3) The arrangements referred to in paragraph (1)(d) must:

        * (a) recognise South Australia's right, as provided for in clauses 91 and 130 of the Agreement, to store its entitlement to water; and

        * (b) recognise that each of New South Wales, Victoria and South Australia is responsible for meeting the critical human water needs of that State, and will decide how water from its share is used.

      * (4) **_State water sharing arrangements_** are the provisions of the Agreement that deal with the sharing of surface water in the River Murray System.

          * Note: The rules and accounting arrangements in the Agreement partition the shared surface water resource of the River Murray System between New South Wales and Victoria, and detail the entitlements to this water by South Australia. The Agreement includes provisions about the way in which the shares are defined, transferred and accounted for, access to and sharing of the storages, access to flows at different times and accounting for losses and overflows. All these provisions are used to determine the quantity of water in each State's share at any given time.

##### 86E  Additional matters relating to Tier 3 water sharing arrangements

      * (1) The Basin Plan must also:

        * (a) specify the conditions under which, due to one or more of the circumstances referred to in subsection (2):

          * (i) Tier 2 water sharing arrangements cease to apply; and

          * (ii) other arrangements (**_Tier 3 water sharing arrangements_**), provided for in the Agreement, commence; and

        * (b) specify the conditions under which Tier 3 water sharing arrangements cease to apply and Tier 2 water sharing arrangements recommence.

      * (2) For the purposes of paragraph (1)(a), the circumstances are:

        * (a) there are extreme and unprecedented low levels of water availability in the River Murray System; or

        * (b) there is extreme and unprecedented poor water quality in the water available in the River Murray System to meet critical human water needs; or

        * (c) there is an extremely high risk that water will not be available in the River Murray System to meet critical human water needs during the next 12 months.

##### 86F  Emergency responses to the reaching of trigger points

      * (1) If a water quality trigger point or salinity trigger point referred to in paragraph 86B(1)(c) is reached, the Authority must:

        * (a) in consultation with the Basin Officials Committee, formulate an emergency response to ensure that water in the River Murray System that is available to meet critical human water needs is returned to a state suitable for meeting critical human water needs; and

        * (b) subject to subsection (2), take the action necessary to implement the emergency response.

      * (2) The Authority must not take any action under paragraph (1)(b) that affects State water sharing arrangements or Border Rivers water sharing arrangements unless the Murray-Darling Basin Ministerial Council has agreed to the action.

      * (3) **_Border Rivers water sharing arrangements_** are the agreements ratified by:

        * (a) the _New South Wales-Queensland Border Rivers Act 1947_ of New South Wales; and

        * (b) the _New South Wales-Queensland Border Rivers Act 1946_ of Queensland;

      * that deal with the distribution and use of surface water.

##### 86G  Effect of this Part on Authority and other agencies of the Commonwealth

      * (1) The Authority and other agencies of the Commonwealth must perform their functions, and exercise their powers, consistently with, and in a manner that gives effect to, the matters included or specified in the Basin Plan under this Part.

      * must be allocated between New South Wales and Victoria as provided in sub-clause (2).

      * (2) The quantity of water estimated for any month in accordance with sub-clause (1) shall be allocated as follows: 

        * (a) for any of the months from May through to August inclusive, the whole quantity shall be allocated half each to New South Wales and Victoria; and 

        * (b) for any of the months from September through to April inclusive - 

           * (i) whenever Victoria is subject to a period of special accounting, the first 12,900 megalitres per month (being equivalent to the ceding by Victoria to New South Wales of a volume of 6,450 megalitres per month); and 

           * (ii) at any other time, the first 16,700 megalitres per month (being equivalent to the ceding by Victoria to New South Wales of a volume of 8,350 megalitres per month),

        * shall be allocated to New South Wales, and the remainder shall be allocated half each to New South Wales and Victoria. 

   * **107.	Allocation of Water in Menindee Lake Storage **

      * **(1)	Half the water entering the Menindee Lakes Storage from the Darling River is allocated to New South Wales and half to Victoria. 

      * (2) Of the water allocated to Victoria and stored in the Menindee Lakes Storage, Victoria must cede 4,170 megalitres each month to New South Wales. 

   * **108.	Tributary Inflows **

      * **(1)	The quantity of water which in any period enters the upper River Murray downstream of Doctors Point from a tributary, or from any artificial outfall approved by the Ministerial Council for the purposes of this clause, other than quantities referred to in clause 107, is allocated to the State from which the water enters the upper River Murray. 

      * (2) The volume of water calculated in accordance with sub-clause 11(1) of Schedule F is allocated to New South Wales. 

      * (3) The volume of water calculated in accordance with sub-clause 11(2) of Schedule F is allocated to Victoria. 

   * **109.	Use by New South Wales and Victoria of Allocated Water **

   * **New South Wales and Victoria are respectively deemed to use the quantity of water:

        * (a) diverted from the upper River Murray by an offtake under the jurisdiction of that State, unless the Ministerial Council determines otherwise; and 

        * (b) calculated under sub-clause 12(1) of Schedule F, in the case of New South Wales; and

      * **(1)	Any water which is lost by evaporation or other means from the upper River Murray is deemed to have been used by New South Wales or Victoria. 

      * (2) Unless otherwise determined by the Ministerial Council: 

        * (a) losses attributable to evaporation from a major storage will be deemed to have been used in proportion to the quantities of water allocated to New South Wales or Victoria in that storage; 

        * (b) losses attributable to an unregulated flow in any part of the upper River Murray will be deemed to have been used in proportion to the flow allocated to New South Wales or Victoria in that part of the river;

        * (c) all other losses will be deemed to have been used half each by New South Wales and Victoria. 

      * (3) For the purposes of this clause an "unregulated flow" means a flow which has not been planned by the Authority. 

   * **111.	New South Wales' and Victoria's Supply to South Australia **

   * **For the purposes of this Subdivision any water supplied in any month to South Australia which it is entitled to receive under clause 88 or 90 is deemed to be supplied half each by New South Wales and Victoria and the Authority must make appropriate adjustments to allocations between New South Wales and Victoria of water in the upper River Murray so as to give effect to those States' obligations under clause 96. 

   * **112.	Commencement of Continuous Accounting of Carryover of Stored Water **

   * **Half the water in each major storage on 1 December 1989 is deemed to have been allocated to New South Wales and half to Victoria. 

   * **113.	Reallocation of Water Between New South Wales and Victoria **

      * **(1)	By agreement between New South Wales and Victoria, any quantity of water allocated to one of those States and in store in any of the upper River Murray storages or in transit in a specified part of the upper River Murray, may be exchanged for a quantity of water allocated to the other State and in store in another of the upper River Murray storages or in transit in another specified part of the upper River Murray, if such an exchange of water does not prejudice the entitlement of South Australia. 

      * (2) The Authority may at any time, with the consent of either New South Wales or Victoria, determine that certain quantities of water in transit in the upper River Murray are surplus to the requirements of that State and reallocate the whole or part of such quantities from that State to the other State. 

   * **114.	Efficient Regulation of the River Murray**

   * **Any water used by either New South Wales or Victoria or supplied to South Australia by either of those States is deemed to be provided from water allocated to that State and the Authority may, as necessary to ensure the availability of appropriately allocated water at the place of such use or supply, reallocate quantities of water in the upper River Murray but must not thereby alter the total quantities of water allocated to New South Wales or Victoria respectively, in the upper River Murray. 

   * **115.	Accounting Procedures **

   * **Subject to clauses 112, 113, 114, 116 and 121, the quantity of water in any part of the upper River Murray and which is allocated to either New South Wales or Victoria is deemed: 

        * (a) to increase in any period by the quantity of water allocated to that State flowing into that part in that period; and 

        * (b) to decrease in any period by any quantities of water - 

           * (i) used by that State by way of diversion or loss from that part in that period; or 

           * (ii) passed from that part in that period for - 

             *    	downstream use by that State, 

             *    	supply by that State to South Australia, 

             *    	conveyance to another part of the upper River Murray as water allocated to that State; or 

           * (iii) released from that part in that period and determined under clause 122 to be a release of water allocated to that State; or 

           * (iv) spilled from that part in that period and deemed under clause 117 to be a spill of water allocated to that State.

   * **116.	Internal Spills **

      * **(1)	In any major storage, water allocated either to New South Wales or Victoria must be re-allocated to the other State to prevent the quantity of water allocated to either State in the storage exceeding half the lesser of: 

        * (a) the target capacity of the storage; or 

        * (b) the quantity of water stored when releases are being made for flood mitigation. 

      * (2) In Hume and Lake Victoria, "target capacity" means the capacity of the reservoir at the Full Supply Level. 

      * (3) In Dartmouth "target capacity" means the lesser of: 

        * (a) the capacity of the reservoir at the Full Supply Level; or 

        * (b) the quantity of water stored when water is being released through the hydro-electric power station and the storage level is above the level specified by the Ministerial Council for the operation of the power station. 

      * (4) In Menindee Lakes "target capacity" means the greater of the capacity: 

        * (a) at the Full Supply Level; or 

        * (b) at such higher level as may be determined from time to time by the Ministerial Council. 

      * (5) When water in Dartmouth Reservoir is to be re-allocated under sub-clause (1) and there is capacity in Hume Reservoir available to the State from which water is to be re-allocated to store some or all of the re-allocated water, a compensating adjustment must be made in Hume Reservoir so that the accounts of the State from which the water is to be re-allocated in Dartmouth Reservoir are not thereby reduced.

   * **117.	Accounting for Spill from Storages **

   * **Any quantity of water spilled from any of the upper River Murray storages, including water released solely to provide space for the retention of floodwaters, is deemed to be water spilled out of the waters allocated to New South Wales or Victoria respectively, in such proportions as minimizes the re-allocation of water under sub-clause 116(1).

   * **118.	Accounting for Releases from Dartmouth Reservoir **

      * **(1)	Whenever the storage level in Dartmouth Reservoir is above the level determined for the purposes of this sub-clause by the Ministerial Council, releases made from Dartmouth Reservoir through the hydro-electric power station will be deemed to be spills and will be accounted for as provided in clause 117. 

      * (2) No release from Dartmouth Reservoir will be attributable to the allocation of water to New South Wales or Victoria if the quantity of water in Dartmouth Reservoir allocated to that State is less than or equal to half the minimum operating storage in the reservoir. 

      * (3) Releases from Dartmouth Reservoir other than those covered by sub-clauses (1) and (2) will be attributable to the allocation of water to New South Wales or Victoria in such proportions as tend most to equalize the quantities of water allocated to those States in Hume Reservoir. 

   * **119.	Accounting for Releases from Hume Reservoir **

      * **(1)	Any release made from Hume Reservoir for the deliberate purpose of transferring water to Lake Victoria for use at a later date will be attributable to the allocation of water to New South Wales or Victoria in such proportions as tend most to equalize the quantities of water allocated to the respective States in Lake Victoria and the Menindee Lakes Storage. 

      * (2) Releases from Hume Reservoir other than those covered by sub-clause (1) will be attributable to the allocation of water to New South Wales or Victoria in such proportions as satisfy the expected downstream water requirements of each State. 

   * **120.	Accounting for Releases from Menindee Lakes Storage **

      * **(1)	For the purposes of this clause releases from Menindee Lakes Storage consist of: 

        * (a) water required to maintain a flow throughout the main course of the Darling River downstream of Menindee Lakes; 

        * (b) water released to satisfy use by New South Wales in the main course of the Darling River downstream of Menindee Lakes; 

        * (c) water released through the Lake Cawndilla Outlet Regulator; 

        * (d) water released down the main course of the Darling River downstream of Menindee Lakes Storage to satisfy directions given by the Authority under sub-clause 98(1); 

        * (e) any other water released from the Menindee Lakes Storage which can be used either to supply South Australia's entitlement under clause 88 or 90 or to supply water to Lake Victoria. 

      * (2) Whenever New South Wales is using water pursuant to sub-clause 95(1) all release from Menindee Lakes Storage will be attributed to the allocation of water to New South Wales. 

      * (3) Whenever sub-clause 95(1) does not apply to the use of water by New South Wales from the Menindee Lakes Storage: 

        * (a) releases under paragraph (1)(a) will be attributed equally to the allocations of water to New South Wales and Victoria; 

        * (b) releases under paragraph (1)(b) and (1)(c) will be attributed to the allocation of water to New South Wales; 

        * (c) releases under paragraph (1)(d) and (1)(e) will be attributed to the respective allocations of New South Wales and Victoria in such proportions as tend most to equalize the water in Lake Victoria allocated to each State, provided that such proportions do not - 

           * (i) cause the water allocated either to New South Wales or to Victoria to fall below 240,000 megalitres; 

           * (ii) cause water to be re-allocated between the States under clause 116. 

   * **121.	Reallocation of Water in Menindee Lakes Storage **

   * **At the conclusion of any period during which New South Wales is using water pursuant to sub-clause 95(1), the quantities of water stored in the Menindee Lakes Storage and allocated respectively to New South Wales and Victoria must be adjusted so that the difference between those quantities is the same as the difference in the allocated quantities at the beginning of that period. 

   * **122.	Accounting for Dilution Flows **

      * **(1)	Whenever the Authority directs under clause 98 that the flow of water is to exceed the water order at a particular point, unless the Ministerial Council determines otherwise, the proportion of the water order attributed respectively to New South Wales and Victoria must be increased by such amounts as tend most to equalise the respective allocations to New South Wales and Victoria of the total flow at that point. 

      * (2) For the purpose of this clause the "water order" is the flow of water at a particular point which is necessary: 

        * (a) to meet diversions by New South Wales and Victoria, losses and dilution flows downstream of that point; 

        * (b) to meet South Australia's entitlement; and 

        * (c) to supply storages downstream of that point. 

##### SUBDIVISION E - PERIODS OF SPECIAL ACCOUNTING

           * (i) the sum of all water entering the Upper River Murray downstream of Doctors Point from - 

            *    	any tributary within that State other than the River Darling, and 

            *    	any artificial outfall from that State approved by the Ministerial Council for the purposes of clause 108; and 

           * (ii) any water allocated to that State which flows to South Australia in excess of South Australia's entitlement under clause 88 or 90. 

        * If (ii) exceeds (i), the account kept under this paragraph must be set at zero; 

        * (c) all water allocated to that State which is supplied by it to meet South Australia's entitlement under paragraph 88(a).

     * One-third of the amount calculated under paragraph 125(a) 

     * **less:**

     * **One-third of the amount calculated under paragraph 125(b) 

     * **less:**

     * **Two-thirds of the amount calculated under paragraph 125(c). 

   * **127.	Limits on Imbalance in Use **

   * **On May 31 in any period of special accounting, the accounts kept under clause 125 must be adjusted by the Authority to ensure that the imbalance in use calculated under clause 126 is: 

        * (a) less than one-third; and 

        * (b) greater than minus two-thirds,

   * of the difference between 1,250,000 megalitres and the reserve allocated to New South Wales or Victoria, as the case may require. 

   * **128.	Restrictions on South Australia's Entitlement **

      * **(1)	In a period of special accounting, instead of the amounts set out in paragraph 88(a), South Australia is entitled to receive, before the end of the following May, the lesser of: 

        * (a) the sum of the monthly quantities set out in paragraph 88(a); and 

        * (b) the sum of - 

           * (i) one-third of the available water determined under paragraph 102(c); and 

           * (ii) any imbalance in use calculated under clause 126. 

      * (2) South Australia may decide how to apportion any entitlement under sub-clause 128(1) between each month provided that the quantity in any month must not exceed that specified in paragraph 88(a).

   * **129.	Termination of Periods of Special Accounting **

   * **The Authority must terminate a period of special accounting declared for New South Wales or Victoria whenever it is satisfied that the reserve allocated to that State at the end of the following May will be greater than 1,250,000 megalitres. 

##### SUBDIVISION F -- ACCOUNTING FOR SOUTH AUSTRALIA'S STORAGE RIGHT

      * **(1)	Subject to sub-clause 19(10), a State Contracting Government may, from time to time, after consulting the Ministerial Council, suspend or limit the operation of this Schedule in that State, if the State Contracting Government considers that: 

        * (a) the use or management of water comprised in entitlements or allocations transferred under this Schedule have increased or accelerated environmental degradation; or 

        * (b) any other State has made inadequate progress towards pricing water to recover full costs, in accordance with principles adopted by the Council of Australian Governments; or 

        * (c) the policies or practices applying within any other State do not achieve the objectives of the National Water Initiative relating to reducing barriers to trading entitlements and allocations and ensuring competitive neutrality in the market for such entitlements and allocations. 

      * (2) The Ministerial Council may, from time to time, having regard to the National Water Initiative, by resolution, suspend or limit the operation of this Schedule in relation to a State or States. 

   * **6.	Power to make protocols **

      * **(1)	The Authority may, in consultation with the Committee, from time to time make protocols: 

        * (a) to implement the provisions for adjusting the cap on diversions set out in Appendix 3; 

        * (b) about calculating salinity debits and credits for the purposes of clause 10;

##### PART III -- MATTERS RELATING TO ADMINISTRATION OF THE AGREEMENT 

   * **7.	Adjustment of delivery of State entitlements **

   * **The Authority must, from time to time, adjust the delivery of State entitlements under Part XII of the Agreement to take into account, and to give effect to, transfers of entitlements and allocations between States, in accordance with Appendix 2. 

   * **8.	Adjustment of cap on diversions **

      * **(1)	Subject to paragraph 16(7)(a), the Authority must, from time to time, adjust the cap on diversions for each designated river valley to reflect interstate and intervalley transfers of entitlements or allocations under this Schedule, in order to ensure that diversions within the Murray-Darling Basin do not exceed the total diversions under baseline conditions referred to in Schedule E. 

      * (2) For the purpose of making any calculation under clause 12 of Schedule E, the relevant annual diversion target for that year must either be increased or reduced, as the case requires, by the volume determined in accordance with Appendix 3. 

   * **9.	Adjustment of State financial contributions **

      * **(1)	In every year, the Authority must, based on information contained in the Transfer Register, calculate the amount by which any sum payable by a State Contracting Government in any year under Part IX of the Agreement, should be varied to reflect transfers of entitlements made by exchange rate trade from river reaches regulated by works subject to the Agreement, into or out of that State in the preceding year and inform the Ministerial Council of that amount for the purposes of clause 72 of the Agreement. 

      * (2) The Ministerial Council may add or subtract, as the case requires, any amount determined under sub-clause 9(1) to or from the sum payable by a State Contracting Government in the next following year, under Part IX of the Agreement. 

      * (3) Despite the provisions of Part IX of the Agreement, a State Contracting Government must pay any sum as varied in accordance with sub-clause 9(2). 

    * **Note: **

       * **	(a) Where an interstate transfer, made either by exchange rate trade or tagged trade, relates to water in a tributary of the River Murray, the recovery of State bulk water charges relating to that water is a matter for agreement between the relevant States. 

       *  (b) Where tagged trade occurs, a transferee in the State of destination holds an entitlement which continues to exist in the State of origin. A State of origin might recover bulk water charges either directly from the holder of the entitlement in the State of destination, or through the relevant water authority in that State, as agreed between the parties. 

   * **10.	Accounting for salinity impacts **

      * **(1)	An entitlement or allocation can only be transferred under this Schedule if the proposed transfer is consistent with Schedule B. 

      * (2) Consistently with the law of the relevant State, a licensing authority within that State must attach such conditions to any transfer into or out of that State which the licensing authority considers necessary or desirable to ensure that the State meets its obligations under Schedule B. 

      * (3) The Authority must attribute salinity credits and debits arising from the dilution effects of interstate transfers of entitlements or allocations to the State of origin and State of destination, in equal shares and in accordance with any protocol made under paragraph 6(1)(b). 

      * (4) The Authority must attribute salinity credits and debits arising from changes to salt accession attributable to any transfer of entitlements or allocations, or changes to the use of water arising from such transfers, to the State in which the change occurs and in accordance with any protocol made under paragraph 6(1)(b). 

##### PART IV -- OPERATIONAL PRINCIPLES AND ADMINISTRATION 

   * **11.	Delivery of water and valley accounts **

      * **(1)	The Authority must ensure that water made available in each valley reflects the transfers of entitlements and allocations made under this Schedule, in accordance with any protocol made under paragraph 6(1)(c). 

      * (2) The valley accounts maintained under sub-clause 11(2) of the former Schedule immediately prior to commencement of this Schedule are continued in existence.

      * (3) For the purpose of this clause, the Authority must maintain a valley account referred to in sub-clause (2): 

        * (a) for each tributary in respect of which there are entitlements or allocations which may be traded under this Schedule; and 

        * (b) in accordance with any protocol made under paragraph 6(1)(c). 

      * (4) The Authority may: 

        * (a) in accordance with any protocol made under paragraph 6(1)(c), direct that water standing to the credit of a valley account for any valley be used for any purpose to which the Authority may have regard under sub-clause 98(3) or 98(4) of the Agreement; and 

        * (b) amend or cancel any such direction at any time. 

      * (5) A State Contracting Government must implement any direction given under paragraph 11(4)(a) in accordance with any protocol made under paragraph 6(1)(c). 

      * (6) With the consent of the State Contracting Government to whom a direction is given under sub-clause 11(4), a direction may result in a valley account being overdrawn. 

   * **12.	Conversion factors and exchange rates **

      * **(1)	Subject to sub-clause 12(2), the Authority may, by a protocol made under paragraph 6(1)(d), determine or alter one or more: 

        * (a) conversion factors to be applied when converting an entitlement of one type into an entitlement of another type, in the same valley; and 

        * (b) exchange rates to be applied under this Schedule: 

           * (i) to any transfer of an entitlement by exchange rate trade; and 

           * (ii) to any transfer of an entitlement by tagged trade or to any transfer of an allocation, 

        * and must publish any such conversion factors and exchange rates in such manner as it thinks fit. 

      * (2) An exchange rate referred to in subparagraph 12(1)(b)(ii) must only be made to take into account either or both of: 

        * (a) any changes in distribution losses; and 

        * (b) any differences in utilization, 

      * resulting from the transfer. 

      * (3) A conversion factor and an exchange rate determined or altered by the Authority operates prospectively and cannot be used to alter: 

        * (a) a previous entry made in any valley account; or 

        * (b) any previous adjustment made to State entitlements or the cap on diversions, or the previous calculation of State financial contributions, 

      * under this Schedule. 

      * (4) A protocol referred to in sub-clause 12(1): 

        * (a) must specify how any conversion factor or exchange rate is to be applied; and 

        * (b) may establish one or more zones within which an exchange rate will not be applied to specified types of entitlement; and 

        * (c) must attempt to minimise any adverse effect that any conversion or any type of transfer may have on: 

           * (i) water users, other than the transferor or transferee; and 

           * (ii) the environment; and 

        * (d) may provide for taking account of: 

           * (i) any losses which may occur during transmission of an entitlement; and 

           * (ii) any change in the level of reliability of supply of an entitlement resulting from the conversion or transfer; and 

           * (iii) the extent to which the volume of water represented by an entitlement has been used; and 

           * (iv) any adverse effect which the conversion or transfer may have on the environment; and 

           * (v) any other matter which the Authority considers appropriate. 

      * (5) Each State Contracting Government must ensure that any licensing authority within the State applies any relevant conversion factor or exchange rate determined under this clause, in accordance with any protocol made under paragraph 6(1)(d). 

   * **13.	Restrictions on transfers **

      * **(1)	Subject to sub-clause 13(4), a protocol made under paragraph 6(1)(e) may prohibit, restrict or regulate the transfer of a specified type of entitlement. 

      * (2) Without limiting sub-clause 13(1), a protocol: 

        * (a) must, subject to other provisions of this clause, facilitate the transfer of entitlements or allocations between hydrologically connected systems, in accordance with this Schedule; and 

        * (b) must be consistent with any principles relating to markets in, and trading of, water entitlements and allocations, from time to time adopted by the Ministerial Council; and 

        * (c) must not hinder the ability of the Authority to regulate and manage the flow of water within the upper River Murray and the River Murray in South Australia, in accordance with the Agreement; and 

        * (d) must not purport to affect or interfere with State responsibilities for managing water resources, except as provided for in the Agreement. 

      * (3) Until the Ministerial Council resolves otherwise an entitlement must not be transferred into or out of the Lower Darling Valley. 

      * (4) A State Contracting Government may, consistently with the law of that State, from time to time prohibit, restrict or regulate the transfer of any type of entitlement or allocation in a way which is consistent with any principles relating to markets in, and trading of, water entitlements, from time to time adopted by the Ministerial Council. 

      * (5) Each State Contracting Government must, consistently with the law of that State, take such action within the State as may be necessary to ensure that any prohibition, restriction or regulation made or imposed by the Authority or the State Contracting Government is complied with and observed by each authority and other person in that State. 

   * **14.	Environmental and supply considerations **

      * **(1)	The Authority must maintain a record of the environmental assessment criteria and processes from time to time applied by each Contracting Government in respect of applications to transfer entitlements or allocations. 

      * (2) Each Contracting Government must: 

        * (a) notify the Authority of any change to the environmental assessment criteria and processes contained in the record referred to in sub-clause 14(1) with respect to that Government, as soon as practicable after that change is made; and 

        * (b) propose any consequential alterations to the record referred to in sub-clause 14(1) which it considers necessary or desirable. 

      * (3) Each Contracting Government must, by 31 July in every year, give the Authority a report setting out all changes referred to in paragraph 14(2)(a) with respect to that Government, made in the previous year.

**SCHEDULE D -- APPENDIX 3 -- ADJUSTING CAP ON DIVERSIONS**

(see clause 8)**

   * 1.	Definitions **

   * **For the purposes of this Appendix: 

   * **cap required, **with respect to a unit of a type of entitlement, means the product of that unit multiplied by the appropriate cap factor referred to in paragraph 8(c). 

   * **effective date **means the beginning of the year in which this Appendix comes into effect. 

##### PART I -- ADJUSTING FOR TRANSFERRED ALLOCATIONS 

   * **2.	Adjusting cap for transferred allocations **

   * **The annual diversion target for a designated river valley, referred to in sub-clause 12(1) of Schedule E, must either be increased or reduced, as the case requires, by the volume of any interstate or intervalley transfers of allocations into or out of that designated river valley in that year, multiplied by the appropriate cap transfer rate set out in Table 1 of a protocol made under paragraph 6(1)(a) of the Schedule. 

##### PART II -- ADJUSTING FOR ENTITLEMENTS TRANSFERRED BY TAGGED TRADE 

   * **3.	Cap adjustment for tagged trade **

   * **The annual diversion target for a designated river valley referred to in sub-clause 12(1) of Schedule E must be: 

        * (a) increased by the volume of water diverted in that designated river valley in that year, which is attributable to entitlements tagged to another designated river valley; and 

        * (b) reduced by the volume of water attributable to entitlements tagged to that designated river valley, which is diverted in any other designated river valley in that year. 

##### PART III -- ADJUSTING FOR ENTITLEMENTS TRANSFERRED BETWEEN 1 JULY 1994 AND THE EFFECTIVE DATE, USING EXCHANGE RATES 

   * **4.	Interim register **

   * **The Authority must establish and maintain an interim register which records the volume of any entitlement transferred from a designated river valley to another designated river valley during each year between 1 July 1994 and the effective date. 

   * **5.	Adjusting annual diversion targets **

   * **Each year, the Authority must calculate the adjustment to the annual diversion target for a designated river valley for transfers recorded on the interim register referred to in clause 4, by: 

        * (a) _multiplying _the cumulative volume of every entitlement of a particular type transferred into the designated river valley between 1 July 1994 and the earlier of the beginning of that year and the effective date, by the appropriate cap transfer rate set out in Table 2 of a protocol made under paragraph 6(1)(a) of the Schedule; and 

        * (b) _multiplying _the cumulative volume of every entitlement of a particular type transferred out of the designated river valley between 1 July 1994 and the earlier of the beginning of that year and the effective date, by the appropriate cap transfer rate; and 

        * (c) _subtracting _the product of (b) from the product of (a). 

##### PART IV -- ADJUSTING FOR ENTITLEMENTS TRANSFERRED OR CONVERTED AFTER THE EFFECTIVE DATE, USING EXCHANGE RATES 

   * **6.	Object of Part **

   * **The object of this Part is, subject to sub-clause 8(1) of the Schedule, to minimise the impact of transfers or conversion of entitlements on entitlements held by third parties, by endeavouring to ensure that: 

        * (a) the proportion of the cap associated with each unit of a particular type of entitlement remains the same after an entitlement has been transferred or converted as it was before that transfer or conversion; and 

        * (b) the annual diversion target for each State and designated river valley referred to in sub-clause 12(1) of Schedule E is adjusted accordingly. 

   * **7.	Operation of Part **

   * **This Part applies to entitlements transferred or converted after the effective date. 

   * **8.	Calculating increases in cap required **

   * **Based on information set out in the Transfer Register, the Authority must make the following calculations for every year, in respect of each designated river valley, as a consequence of transfers between that designated river valley and every other designated river valley: 

        * (a) The **volume of each type of entitlement **into which former entitlements were transferred or converted, as recorded under sub-paragraphs 16(3)(b)(ii) and 16(3)(a)(ii) of this Schedule. 

        * (b) The **net increase in each type of entitlement**, by subtracting the volume of that type of entitlement recorded under sub-paragraphs 16(3)(a)(iii) and 16(3)(a)(i) of this Schedule from the volume of that type of entitlement calculated under paragraph 8(a). 

        * (c) The **net increase in the cap required **for each type of entitlement , by multiplying the result of the calculation in paragraph 8(b) by the relevant cap factor set out in Table 3 of a protocol made under paragraph 6(1)(a) of the Schedule. 

   * **9.	Adjusting annual diversion targets **

      * **(1)	The Authority must, in each year, alter each long-term diversion cap to reflect the results of transferring entitlements, pursuant to paragraph 10(2)(a) of Schedule E, by adjusting annual diversion targets. 

      * (2) The Authority must adjust each annual diversion target by following any protocol made by the Authority under paragraph 6(1)(a) of the Schedule, to implement the Stages set out below. 

**Stage 1 **

        * **Adjust annual diversion targets, as far as possible by allocating to the cap required in a designated river valley of destination, so much of the volume of cap no longer required in the designated river valley of origin as is required in the designated river valley of destination. A separate calculation must be made for the interaction between each designated river valley and every other designated river valley, based on information collated from the Transfer Register. 

**Stage 2 **

        * **Pool any cap surpluses and deficits calculated under Stage 1 in relation to each designated river valley, in order to reduce any shortfalls in each designated river valley. 

        * Where lower reliability entitlements have been converted to higher reliability entitlements within a designated river valley, the net effect of that conversion on the cap attributable to that valley must be included in the pool. However: 

        * (a) a shortfall within a designated river valley caused by such conversions cannot be reduced by attributing a surplus existing in another designated river valley; and 

        * (b) the volume pooled with respect to a designated river valley cannot exceed the sum of the deficits arising in other designated river valleys, as a result of transfers between that designated river valley and other designated river valleys. 

**Stage 3 **

        * **(a)	Calculate any cap surplus resulting from Stage 2 for each designated river valley. 

        * (b) Then allocate any of that cap surplus that is attributable to interstate transfers into or from that designated river valley to the environment, by 

        * (c) reducing the annual diversion target for that designated river valley by the portion of the surplus referred to in paragraph (b). 

        * The allocation referred to in paragraph (b) must only apply in the year in which it is made and will not create an entitlement to draw a comparable volume of water from any storage in the Basin. Progressively reducing annual diversion targets will, however, eventually allow more water to flow downstream. 

**Stage 4 **

        * **Calculate the adjustment to each annual diversion target for each designated river valley by determining the sum of the total adjustments made under Stages 1, 2 and 3.

**
