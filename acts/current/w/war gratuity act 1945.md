     * (1) The number of months in respect of which a member is entitled to war gratuity in respect of the member's service at the rate prescribed for overseas qualifying service shall be the number of months of overseas qualifying service of the member based on the total number of days on which the member has performed overseas qualifying service (any fraction of a month being treated as one month) together with any additional period required to be included in pursuance of section eight of this Act.

     * (2) The number of months in respect of which a member is entitled to war gratuity in respect of the member's service at the rate prescribed for general qualifying service shall be the number of months of general qualifying service of the member based on the total number of days on which the member has performed general qualifying service (any fraction of a month being treated as one month) less the number of months in respect of which the member is entitled to war gratuity in respect of the member's service at the rate prescribed for overseas qualifying service.

##### 13  Addition to war gratuity in case of death

     * (1) Where death due to war service occurred while the member was performing service specified in section seven of this Act, a sum calculated at the rate prescribed for overseas qualifying service for a period of seven months shall be added to the war gratuity to which the member would otherwise be entitled.

##### 14  Minimum war gratuity in case of death and total dependency

     * (1) Where the death of a member due to war service occurred prior to the first day of July, One thousand nine hundred and fortyseven and a prescribed authority determines in accordance with the regulations that the spouse, or a child, parent, stepparent, fosterparent or dependant of the member was totally dependent on that member at the date of the member's death, an amount of war gratuity not less than the amount prescribed in respect of a period of three years service at the rate prescribed for overseas qualifying service (including any sum added under the last preceding section) shall, subject to section six of this Act, be credited and paid in respect of the deceased member's service, whether or not the member had, at the date of the member's death, any general qualifying service.

     * Provided that: 

      * (a) where disqualification under this section results from a member's absence without leave and a prescribed authority is satisfied that the member has neglected or failed to provide adequately for the member's dependants, the prescribed authority may authorize credit to some or all of those dependants of such amounts of war gratuity as the prescribed authority thinks fit, not exceeding in the aggregate the amount which could, but for this section, have been credited to, or in respect of the service of, that member;

      * (b) where in any case a prescribed authority, having regard to the meritorious service rendered by the member or other special circumstances, considers that it is inequitable to withhold the war gratuity which would, but for this section, have been credited, the prescribed authority may authorize the credit of the whole or such part of the war gratuity as the prescribed authority considers justified; and

      * (c) where an occurrence relating to the service of a member has rendered the member liable to be disqualified for war gratuity under the provisions of this section and the member subsequently reenlisted or was reappointed for service, the occurrence relating to the member's earlier service shall not render the member liable to be disqualified for war gratuity in respect of service following the member's reenlistment or reappointment after the time of the occurrence.

##### 16  Deductions

     * From the amount of any war gratuity to be credited there shall be deducted:

      * (a) is beneficially entitled under the will of the deceased to any part of his estate; or
