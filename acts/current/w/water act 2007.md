##### 22  Content of Basin Plan

      * Mandatory content of Basin Plan

      * (1) The Basin Plan must include the matters set out in the following table:

            * Note: The Basin Plan must also include matters relating to critical human water needs (see Part 2A).

      * (2) Areas identified as water resource plan areas under item 2 of the table in subsection (1) may overlap.

            * Note: Although the areas may overlap, they may relate to different water resources within the common area.

      * (3) Without limiting item 11 of the table in subsection (1), the requirements specified under that item for a water resource plan for a water resource plan area must include requirements in relation to:

        * (a) the identification of the water resource plan area; and

        * (b) the incorporation, and application, of the longterm annual diversion limit for the water resources of the water resource plan area (see also subsections (6A) and (6B)); and

        * (c) the sustainable use and management of the water resources of the water resource plan area within that diversion limit; and

        * (d) the regulation, for the purposes of managing Basin water resources, of interception activities with a significant impact (whether on an activitybyactivity basis or cumulatively) on those water resources; and

        * (e) planning for environmental watering; and

        * (f) water quality and salinity objectives for the water resource plan area; and

        * (g) the circumstances in which tradeable water rights in relation to the water resource plan area may be traded, or transferred, and the conditions applicable to such trades or transfers; and

        * (h) broad approaches to the way risks to the water resources of the water resource plan area should be addressed; and

        * (i) metering the water taken from the water resources of the water resource plan area and monitoring the water resources of the water resource plan area; and

        * (j) reviews of the water resource plan and amendments of the plan arising from those reviews; and

        * (k) the scientific information or models on which the water resource plan is to be based.

      * The requirements in relation to the matters referred to in paragraph (g) must contribute to achieving the Basin water market and trading objectives and principles that are set out in Schedule 3.

      * (4) The requirements referred to in a paragraph in subsection (3) need not apply in relation to the water resource plan for a water resource plan area if those requirements are not relevant to the water resource plan area given the management objectives for the area.

            * Note: If the management objective for the area is to preserve the natural values of a river system through no development, some of the requirements that relate to the use and management of the water resources of the water resource plan area may be irrelevant.

      * (5) The requirements specified under item 11 of the table in subsection (1) may include a requirement for a water resource plan to provide for the metering of stock and domestic water use only to the extent that such metering is necessary for the effective management of the Basin water resources.

            * Note: Metering may, for example, be necessary for the effective management of the Basin water resources where a particular ground water resource is under stress or where there are local disputes about water sharing.

      * (6) To avoid doubt:

        * (a) there may be different requirements under item 11 of the table in subsection (1) for different kinds of water resource plan areas or to meet different management objectives; and

        * (b) a requirement under that item may be one that, in accordance with its terms, does not apply to a particular water resource plan area or applies only to a limited extent.

      * Adjustments to longterm annual diversion limits

      * (6A) The requirements in paragraph (3)(b) must include a requirement for a water resource plan for a water resource plan area to contain a mechanism for incorporating and applying the longterm annual diversion limit for the water resources of that plan area (or for a particular part of those water resources), as that limit is after it has been amended to take account of a relevant SDL adjustment.

      * (6B) For the purposes of subsection (6A), a **_relevant SDL adjustment_**, in relation to a water resource plan area, is an adjustment of the longterm average sustainable diversion limit for the water resources of that plan area (or for a particular part of those water resources) that is adopted under subsection 23B(6) as an amendment of the Basin Plan after the water resource plan for that plan area is accredited or adopted.

      * (7) The requirements referred to in paragraph (3)(d):

        * (a) may require that interception activities with, or with the potential to have, significant impacts on the water resources of the water resource plan area are assessed to determine whether they are consistent with the water resource plan before they are approved under:

          * (i) any other laws of a Basin State; or

          * (ii) a particular law of a Basin State; and

        * (b) may require that water access rights be held for specified kinds of interception activities.

      * Matters that may not be dealt with by the Basin Plan

      * (9) The provisions of the Basin Plan have effect only to the extent to which they relate to a matter that is relevant to the use or management of Basin water resources.

      * (10) A provision of the Basin Plan has no effect to the extent to which the provision directly regulates:

        * (a) land use or planning in relation to land use; or

        * (b) the management of natural resources (other than water resources); or

        * (c) the control of pollution.

      * (11) For the purposes of subsection (10), a provision directly regulates a matter referred to in paragraph (10)(a), (b) or (c) if the provision:

        * (a) prohibits a person (including an agency of a State) from undertaking an activity in relation to that matter (either absolutely or unless the person satisfies particular conditions); or

        * (b) requires a person (including an agency of a State) to undertake an activity in relation to that matter; or

        * (c) requires a person (including an agency of a State) who undertakes an activity in relation to that matter to carry that activity out in a particular way; or

        * (d) imposes an obligation on a person (including an agency of a State) in relation to the carrying out of an activity in relation to that matter, including an obligation to obtain consent or approval in relation to that matter; or

        * (e) imposes an obligation on a person (including an agency of a State) in connection with the performance of a function relating to a matter referred to in paragraph (a), (b), (c) or (d), including by obliging the person to impose such an obligation on another person or agency.

      * This subsection does not limit subsection (10).

        * together with the Authority's views on the Minister's suggestions; and

        * (d) prepare a document that summarises:

          * (i) any submissions it received in response to the consultations referred to in paragraph (b); and

          * (ii) how it addressed those submissions; and

          * (iii) the extent (if any) to which its consideration of those submissions has affected the version or views given to the Minister under paragraph (c).

      * (3) Within 30 days after the Authority gives the Minister a version of the water resource plan under subsection (2), the Minister must:

        * (a) consider that version of the water resource plan and the views given to the Minister under subsection (2); and

        * (b) either:

          * (i) adopt that version of the water resource plan; or

          * (ii) direct the Authority, in writing, to make modifications to that version of the water resource plan and give it to the Minister for adoption.

      * (4) A direction under subparagraph (3)(b)(ii) is not a legislative instrument.

      * (5) The Minister must not give a direction under subparagraph (3)(b)(ii) in relation to any aspect of the water resource plan that is of a factual or scientific nature.

      * (6) If the Minister gives a direction under subparagraph (3)(b)(ii):

        * (a) the Authority must comply with the direction; and

        * (b) the Minister must adopt the water resource plan given to the Minister in compliance with the direction.

      * (7) When the water resource plan is laid before a House of the Parliament under the _Legislative Instruments Act 2003_, the Minister must also lay before that House a document that sets out:

        * (a) any direction the Minister gave under subparagraph (3)(b)(ii) in relation to the water resource plan; and

        * (b) the Minister's reasons for giving that direction.

##### 70  Duration of plan adopted under section 69

            * Note: The surface water of the Googong Dam Area is to be treated as if it were located in the Australian Capital Territory (see section 63A).

      * (2) The Authority may, in writing, extend the period within which the report must be given to the Authority.

#### Division 3--Procedures to be followed before taking stepin action

##### 72  Scope of Division

      * (1) This Division provides for the procedure to be followed before the exercise of the power of the Minister to request the Authority under section 68 to prepare a water resource plan for a water resource plan area located in a Basin State.

      * (2) This power is the **_stepin power_**.

      * (3) The Basin State is the **_affected Basin State_**.

##### 73  Procedure to be followed before exercising stepin power

      * Good faith negotiation

      * (1) The Minister must negotiate in good faith with the affected Basin State, and any relevant agency of the affected Basin State, with a view to dealing effectively with the circumstances without the exercise of the stepin power.

      * Preliminary notice

      * (2) Before the Minister exercises the stepin power in relation to particular circumstances, the Minister must give the relevant State Minister for the affected Basin State a preliminary notice that:

        * (a) specifies the circumstances; and

        * (b) sets out the Minister's reasons for being satisfied that the circumstances give rise to the stepin power; and

        * (c) indicates that the Minister is considering exercising the stepin power; and

        * (d) indicates that the Minister is willing to engage in a mediation process in relation to the circumstances; and

      * Mediation

      * (3) If the affected Basin State indicates that it is willing to engage in a mediation process in relation to the circumstances, the mediator is to be:

        * (a) a person determined by agreement between the Minister and the Basin State; or

        * (b) a person nominated by the President of the Law Council of Australia if the Minister and the Basin State do not agree on a person to be the mediator.

      * (4) The process for the mediation is to be:

        * (a) the process agreed by the Minister and the affected Basin State; or

        * (b) the process determined by the mediator if the Minister and the affected Basin State do not agree on the process for the mediation.

      * (5) Representatives of the Minister must attend any mediation sessions called by the mediator.

      * (6) The affected Basin State is to be taken to have indicated that it is not willing to engage in a mediation process in relation to the circumstances if it does not give the notice requested in paragraph (2)(e) within the period of 2 weeks referred to in that paragraph.

      * Formal notice

      * (7) The Minister may give the relevant State Minister for the affected Basin State a notice under subsection (8) if:

#### Division 4--Allocation of risks in relation to reductions in water availability

##### Subdivision A--Risks arising from reductions in diversion limits

##### 74  Simplified outline

      * (1) This section provides a simplified outline of this Subdivision.

      * (2) When the longterm average sustainable diversion limit for the water resources of a water resource plan area (or for a particular part of those water resources) is reduced, the Basin Plan identifies the Commonwealth's share (if any) of the reduction.

            * Note 1: The Commonwealth's share includes reductions attributable to changes in Commonwealth Government policy and may also include some part of reductions attributable to improvements in knowledge about the environmentally sustainable level of take for the water resources of a water resource plan area.

            * Note 2: See section 75.

      * (3) The Commonwealth:

        * (a) endeavours to manage the impact of the Commonwealth's share of the reduction on the holders of water access entitlements; and

        * (b) may take steps to ensure that the holders of water access entitlements do not suffer a reduction in their water allocations as a result of the Commonwealth's share of the reduction.

            * Note: See section 76.

      * (4) If, despite the Commonwealth's efforts, the water allocation of a holder of a water access entitlement is reduced and the reduction is reasonably attributable to the Commonwealth's share of the reduction in the longterm average sustainable diversion limit, the holder may be entitled to a payment under section 77.

##### 74A  States applying the risk assignment framework

      * (1) The Minister must, in writing, determine that a Basin State is a State to which this section applies if the Minister is satisfied that a State water management law of the State:

        * (a) has applied the risk assignment framework provided for in clauses 48 to 50 of the National Water Initiative, read in conjunction with clause 10.1.3 of the Agreement on MurrayDarling Basin Reform of 3 July 2008; and

        * (b) has applied that framework by, and at all times since:

          * (i) 30 June 2009; or

          * (ii) a later day specified in the regulations.

            * Note: Clauses 48 to 50 of the National Water Initiative and clause 10.1.3 of the Agreement on MurrayDarling Basin Reform of 3 July 2008 are set out in Schedule 3A.

      * (2) The day specified in regulations made for the purposes of subparagraph (1)(b)(ii) must not be later than the day on which the Basin Plan first takes effect.

      * (2A) The Minister is taken, on the commencement of this section, to have made a determination under subsection (1) that New South Wales is a State to which this section applies.

      * (3) The Minister must, in writing, revoke a determination made under subsection (1) if satisfied that there is no longer a State water management law of the State that gives effect to that framework.

      * (5) A determination made under subsection (1), or a revocation under subsection (3), is not a legislative instrument.

##### 75  Basin Plan to specify Commonwealth share of reduction in longterm average sustainable diversion limit

      * (1) If the longterm average sustainable diversion limit for the water resources of a water resource plan area (or for a particular part of those water resources) is reduced, the Basin Plan must specify:

        * (a) the amount of the reduction; and

        * (b) the amount of so much (if any) of the reduction as is attributable to changes in Commonwealth Government policy (the **_Commonwealth Government policy component_** of the reduction); and

        * (c) the amount of so much (if any) of the reduction as is attributable to improvements in knowledge about the environmentally sustainable level of take for the water resources of the water resource plan area (the **_new knowledge component_** of the reduction); and

        * (d) the amount of so much (if any) of the reduction as is the Commonwealth's share of the reduction (worked out under subsection (2)).

      * Each of the amounts referred to in paragraphs (a), (b), (c) and (d) is to be expressed as a quantity of water per year.

      * (1A) In working out the amount of the Commonwealth Government policy component or the new knowledge component, any reduction that is a result of matters referred to in clause 48 of the National Water Initiative is to be disregarded.

            * Note: Clause 48 of the National Water Initiative is set out in Part 1 of Schedule 3A.

      * (2) The **_Commonwealth's share_** of the reduction is to be worked out as follows:

        * (a) the Commonwealth's share of the reduction includes the Commonwealth Government policy component of the reduction (if any); and

        * (b) if the Basin State in which the water resource plan area is located is not a State to which section 74A applies, and the reduction is one that takes effect on or after 1 January 2015--the Commonwealth's share of the reduction also includes so much of the new knowledge component (if any) as is worked out under subsection (3); and

        * (c) if the Basin State in which the water resource plan area is located is a State to which section 74A applies--the Commonwealth's share of the reduction also includes so much of the new knowledge component (if any) as is worked out under subsection (3A).

      * (3) The amount to be included in the Commonwealth's share of the reduction under paragraph (2)(b) is to be worked out on the basis that, for reductions in the longterm average sustainable diversion limit for the water resources, or that part of the water resources, of the water resource plan area in any 10 year period, the Commonwealth's share of the reductions:

        * (a) does not include so much of new knowledge components of those reductions as does not exceed (in aggregate) 3% of the relevant diversion limit; and

        * (b) includes twothirds of so much of the new knowledge components of those reductions as:

          * (i) exceeds (in aggregate) 3% of the relevant diversion limit; and

          * (i) does not exceed (in aggregate) 6% of the relevant diversion limit; and

        * (c) includes 50% of so much of the new knowledge components of those reductions as exceed (in aggregate) 6% of the relevant diversion limit.

      * (3A) The amount to be included in the Commonwealth's share of the reduction under paragraph (2)(c) is to be worked out on the basis that, for reductions in the longterm average sustainable diversion limit for the water resources, or that part of the water resources, of the water resource plan area in any 10 year period, the Commonwealth's share of the reductions:

        * (a) does not include so much of new knowledge components of those reductions as does not exceed (in aggregate) 3% of the relevant diversion limit; and

        * (b) includes all of so much of the new knowledge components of those reductions as exceeds (in aggregate) 3% of the relevant diversion limit.

      * (4) For the purposes of applying subsection (3) or (3A) for a reduction in the longterm average sustainable diversion limit for the water resources, or part of the water resources, of a water resource plan area, the **_relevant diversion limit_** is the earliest longterm average sustainable diversion limit for those water resources, or that part of those water resources, that applied:

        * (a) during the 10 years immediately preceding the reduction; and

        * (b) on or after:

          * (i) if the Basin State in which the water resource plan area is located is a State to which section 74A applies, and a transitional water resource plan or an interim water resource plan has effect for the area--the day on which that plan ceases to have effect; or

          * (ii) in any other case--1 January 2015.

            * Note: The surface water of the Googong Dam Area is to be treated as if it were located in the Australian Capital Territory (see section 63A).

##### 76  Commonwealth to manage Commonwealth share of reduction in diversion limit

      * If the Basin Plan specifies, under subsection 75(1), the Commonwealth's share of a reduction in the longterm average sustainable diversion limit for the water resources of a water resource plan area, or for the particular part of those water resources, the Commonwealth:

        * (a) must endeavour to manage the impact of the Commonwealth's share of the reduction in the limit on the holders of water access entitlements; and

        * (b) may take steps to ensure that the holders of water access entitlements do not suffer a reduction in their water allocations, or a change in the reliability of their water allocations, as a result of the Commonwealth's share of the reduction in the limit.

            * Note 1: This subsection implements in part the policy in clauses 49 and 50 of the National Water Initiative.

            * Note 2: If a reduction in, or a change in the reliability of, a water allocation results despite the steps taken by the Commonwealth, the Commonwealth may be liable for an amount under section 77.

##### 77  Payments to water access entitlement holders

      * Qualification for payment under this section

      * (1) A person (the **_entitlement holder_**) qualifies for a payment under this section if:

        * (a) the entitlement holder holds a water access entitlement in relation to a water resource plan area; and

        * (b) one of the following subparagraphs is satisfied:

          * (i) the water access entitlement was granted, issued or authorised before 25 January 2007;

          * (ii) the water access entitlement is granted, issued or authorised in accordance with a transitional water resource plan;

          * (iii) the water access entitlement is granted, issued or authorised on or after 25 January 2007, and before the Basin Plan first takes effect, and the Minister determines in writing that the entitlement relates to a water resource that was not overallocated at the time of, or because of, the grant, issue or authorisation;

          * (iv) the water access entitlement is granted, issued or authorised after the Basin Plan first takes effect and is granted, issued or authorised in accordance with the Basin Plan and the water resource plan for the water resources of the water resource plan area, or for the particular part of the water resources of the area; and

        * (c) there is:

          * (i) a reduction in the water allocations to be made in relation to the water access entitlement; or

          * (ii) a change in the reliability of those water allocations; and

        * (d) the reduction in the water allocations, or the change in the reliability of the water allocations, occurs because of a reduction (the **_diversion limit reduction_**) in the longterm average sustainable diversion limit for the water resources of the water resource plan area, or for the particular part of those water resources; and

        * (e) the whole, or a part, of the reduction in the water allocations, or the change in the reliability of the water allocations, is reasonably attributable to the Commonwealth's share of the reduction.

      * A determination under subparagraph (b)(iii) is not a legislative instrument.

      * (2) In applying paragraph (1)(e), regard is to be had to:

        * (a) any steps taken by the Commonwealth to ensure that holders of water access entitlements do not suffer a reduction in their water allocations, or a change in the reliability of their water allocations, as a result of the diversion limit reduction; and

        * (b) the effect of those steps on the water allocations, or the reliability of the water allocations, made to the holders of water access entitlements; and

        * (c) the effect of the other provisions of the Basin Plan.

      * Minister to decide claim

      * (3) If the entitlement holder makes a claim for a payment under this section in relation to the diversion limit reduction, the Minister must:

        * (a) if the Minister is satisfied that the entitlement holder qualifies for a payment under this section in relation to the reduction:

          * (i) determine that a payment under this section is to be made to the entitlement holder in relation to the reduction; and

          * (ii) determine the amount of the payment under this section to be made to the entitlement holder; and

        * (b) if the Minister is not satisfied that the entitlement holder qualifies for a payment under this section in relation to the reduction--determine that a payment under this section is not to be made to the entitlement holder in relation to the reduction.

      * Amount of payment under this section

      * (4) Subject to subsection (6), the amount of the payment under this section is worked out as follows:

        * (a) first work out the amount of the reduction in the market value of the entitlement holder's water access entitlement that occurred because of the reduction in, or the change in the reliability of, the entitlement holder's water allocations;

        * (b) then work out how much of that reduction in market value is reasonably attributable to the Commonwealth's share of the diversion limit reduction.

      * (5) In applying paragraph (4)(b), regard is to be had to:

        * (a) any steps taken by the Commonwealth to ensure that holders of water access entitlements do not suffer a reduction in, or a change in the reliability of, their water allocations as a result of the diversion limit reduction; and

        * (b) the effect of those steps on the water allocations made to the holders of water access entitlements; and

        * (c) the effect of the other provisions of the Basin Plan.

      * (6) The amount of the payment under this section must not exceed the amount worked out as follows:

        * (a) first work out the percentage of the diversion limit reduction represented by the Commonwealth share of the reduction;

        * (b) then apply that percentage to the amount worked out under paragraph (4)(a).

      * AAT review

      * (7) An application may be made to the Administrative Appeals Tribunal for the review of:

        * (a) a determination of the Minister under paragraph (3)(b); or

        * (b) a determination of the Minister under subparagraph (3)(a)(ii).

      * Substitute entitlements

      * (8) If:

        * (a) a water access entitlement (the **_substitute entitlement_**) is granted, issued or authorised; and

        * (b) the substitute entitlement is granted, issued or authorised in substitution for an equivalent water access right (the **_earlier right_**) that was previously granted, issued or authorised at a particular time;

      * the substitute entitlement is taken, for the purposes of applying paragraph (1)(b), to have been granted, issued or authorised at the time when the earlier right was granted, issued or authorised.

            * Note: This means, for example, that if the earlier right was granted, issued or authorised before 25 January 2007, the substitute entitlement is also taken to have been granted, issued or authorised before 25 January 2007.

      * (9) For the purposes of subsection (8), the substitute entitlement is not equivalent to the earlier right if the amount of water that can be taken under the substitute entitlement is more than the amount of water that could be taken under the earlier right.

##### 78  Applying Subdivision when transitional or interim water resource plan ends

      * (1) This section applies if a transitional water resource plan, or an interim water resource plan, for a water resource plan area is in effect when the Basin Plan first takes effect.

      * (2) The Basin Plan must specify the longterm average limit on the quantity of water that can be taken from the water resources of the water resource plan area that the Authority is satisfied will be applicable immediately before the transitional water resource plan, or interim water resource plan, ceases to have effect.

      * (3) For the purposes of applying this Subdivision:

        * (a) the longterm average sustainable diversion limit for the water resources of the water resource plan area is taken to be reduced when the transitional water resource plan, or interim water resource plan, ceases to have effect if:

          * (i) the longterm average limit specified under subsection (2); exceeds

          * (ii) the longterm average sustainable diversion limit for the water resources of the water resource plan area that is specified in the Basin Plan; and

        * (b) the amount of the reduction is the amount of the excess; and

        * (c) the Basin Plan must specify the amounts referred to in paragraphs 75(1)(a), (b), (c) and (d) in relation to the reduction.

##### 79  Regulations

      * (1) The regulations may provide for matters that are necessary or convenient to be provided for in relation to claims for payments under section 77.

      * (2) Without limiting subsection (1), the regulations made for the purposes of that subsection may provide for:

        * (a) how a person is to make a claim under section 77; and

        * (b) the time within which the person may make the claim; and

        * (c) the information that the person making a claim must provide in support of the claim; and

        * (d) the procedure to be followed in dealing with the claim; and

        * (e) the method to be used to calculate the amount of a reduction in a water allocation to which the claim relates; and

        * (f) the method to be used to calculate the change in market value of a water access entitlement in relation to which the claim is made.

      * (3) Without limiting subsection (1), the regulations made for the purposes of that subsection may require a Basin State, an agency of a Basin State or another person, to give the Commonwealth, the Authority or another agency of the Commonwealth information for the purposes of dealing with a claim made under section 77.

      * (1) This section provides a simplified outline of this Subdivision.

      * (2) When a change to the Basin Plan would result in a change in the reliability of the water allocations in relation to the water resources of a water resource plan area, the Basin Plan identifies the change and may also specify the Commonwealth's share (if any) of that change in reliability.

            * Note 1: The Commonwealth's share is worked out in accordance with the provisions of the National Water Initiative. The Initiative provides that the Commonwealth's share includes changes attributable to changes in Commonwealth Government policy and, for changes that occur on or after 1 January 2015, may also include some part of changes attributable to improvements in knowledge about the environmentally sustainable level of take for the water resources of a water resource plan area.

            * Note 2: See section 81.

      * (3) The Commonwealth:

        * (a) endeavours to manage the impact of the Commonwealth's share of the potential change in reliability on the holders of water access entitlements; and

        * (b) may take steps to ensure that the holders of water access entitlements do not suffer a change in the reliability of their water allocations as a result of the Commonwealth's share of the potential change.

            * Note: See section 82.

      * (4) If, despite the Commonwealth's efforts, there is a change in the reliability of the water allocations of a holder of a water access entitlement and the change is reasonably attributable to the Commonwealth's share of the change in reliability, the holder may be entitled to a payment under section 83.

##### 81  Basin Plan to specify certain matters if Plan results in change in reliability of water allocations

      * (1) This section applies if:

        * (a) a change to the Basin Plan would, if action were not to be taken under this Subdivision, result in a change in the reliability of water allocations in relation to the water resources of a water resource plan area; and

        * (b) this would occur otherwise than because of a reduction in the longterm average sustainable diversion limit for those water resources (or for a part of those water resources).

      * (2) The Basin Plan must:

        * (a) specify that this Subdivision applies to that change to the Basin Plan; and

        * (b) specify the nature of the change in the reliability of those water allocations.

      * (3) The Basin Plan may specify the following:

        * (a) the extent (if any) to which the change in reliability is attributable to changes in Commonwealth Government policy (the **_Commonwealth Government policy component_** of the change in reliability);

        * (b) the extent (if any) to which the change in reliability is attributable to improvements in knowledge about the environmentally sustainable level of take for the water resources of the water resource plan area (the **_new knowledge component_** of the change in reliability);

        * (c) the extent (if any) of the Commonwealth's share of the change in reliability.

      * (3A) In working out the amount of the Commonwealth Government policy component or the new knowledge component, any reduction that is a result of matters referred to in clause 48 of the National Water Initiative is to be disregarded.

            * Note: Clause 48 of the National Water Initiative is set out in Part 1 of Schedule 3A.

      * (4) The Commonwealth's share of the change in reliability is to be worked out for the purposes of paragraph (3)(c) in accordance with:

        * (a) the provisions of the National Water Initiative; and

        * (b) any regulations made for the purposes of this paragraph.

      * Regulations made for the purposes of paragraph (b) must not be inconsistent with the National Water Initiative.

##### 82  Commonwealth to manage Commonwealth share of change in reliability

      * If the Basin Plan specifies, under paragraph 81(3)(c), the Commonwealth's share of a change in the reliability of the water allocations in relation to the water resources of a water resource plan area, the Commonwealth:

        * (a) must endeavour to manage the impact of the Commonwealth's share of the change in reliability on the holders of water access entitlements; and

        * (b) may take steps to ensure that the holders of water access entitlements do not suffer a change in the reliability of their water allocations as a result of the Commonwealth's share of the change in reliability.

            * Note 1: This subsection implements in part the policy in clauses 49 and 50 of the National Water Initiative.

            * Note 2: If a change in the reliability of water allocations results despite the steps taken by the Commonwealth, the Commonwealth may be liable for an amount under section 83.

##### 83  Payments to water access entitlement holders

      * Qualification for payment under this section

      * (1) A person (the **_entitlement holder_**) qualifies for a payment under this section if:

        * (a) the entitlement holder holds a water access entitlement in relation to the water resources of a water resource plan area; and

        * (b) one of the following subparagraphs is satisfied:

          * (i) the water access entitlement was granted, issued or authorised before 25 January 2007;

          * (ii) the water access entitlement is granted, issued or authorised in accordance with a transitional water resource plan;

          * (iii) the water access entitlement is granted, issued or authorised on or after 25 January 2007, and before the Basin Plan first takes effect, and the Minister determines in writing that the entitlement relates to a water resource that was not overallocated at the time of, or because of, the grant, issue or authorisation;

          * (iv) the water access entitlement is granted, issued or authorised after the Basin Plan first takes effect and is granted, issued or authorised in accordance with the Basin Plan and the water resource plan for the water resources of the water resource plan area, or for the particular part of the water resources of the area; and

        * (c) there is a change in the reliability of the water allocations to be made in relation to the water access entitlement; and

        * (d) the change in reliability of the entitlement holder's water allocations occurs because of a change (the **_relevant Plan change_**) to the Basin Plan; and

        * (e) the Basin Plan specifies that this Subdivision applies to the relevant Plan change; and

        * (f) the whole, or a part, of the change in the reliability of the entitlement holder's water allocations is reasonably attributable to the Commonwealth's share of the relevant Plan change.

      * A determination under subparagraph (b)(iii) is not a legislative instrument.

      * (2) For the purposes of applying this section to the change in the reliability of the entitlement holder's water allocations, the **_Commonwealth's share_** of the relevant Plan change is:

        * (a) the Commonwealth's share of the change in reliability that is specified in the Basin Plan under paragraph 81(3)(c) if that share is specified in the Basin Plan under that paragraph; or

        * (b) the Commonwealth's share of the change in reliability of the entitlement holder's water allocations that results from the relevant Plan change (as determined, in writing, by the Authority) if paragraph (a) does not apply.

      * A determination by the Authority under paragraph (b) is not a legislative instrument.

            * Note: The Authority is not subject to the Minister's direction in relation to a determination under paragraph (b) (see paragraph 175(2)(a)).

      * (3) The Commonwealth's share of the change in reliability of the entitlement holder's water allocations is to be worked out for the purposes of paragraph (2)(b) in accordance with:

        * (a) the provisions of the National Water Initiative; and

        * (b) any regulations made for the purposes of this paragraph.

      * Regulations made for the purposes of paragraph (b) must not be inconsistent with the National Water Initiative.

      * (4) In applying paragraph (1)(f), regard is to be had to:

        * (a) any steps taken by the Commonwealth to ensure that holders of water access entitlements do not suffer a change in the reliability of their water allocations as a result of the relevant Plan change; and

        * (b) the effect of those steps on the reliability of the water allocations made to the holders of water access entitlements; and

        * (c) the effect of the other provisions of the Basin Plan.

      * Minister to decide claim

      * (5) If the entitlement holder makes a claim for a payment under this section in relation to the relevant Plan change, the Minister must:

        * (a) if the Minister is satisfied that the entitlement holder qualifies for a payment under this section in relation to the relevant Plan change:

          * (i) determine that a payment under this section is to be made to the entitlement holder in relation to the relevant Plan change; and

          * (ii) determine the amount of the payment under this section to be made to the entitlement holder; and

        * (b) if the Minister is not satisfied that the entitlement holder qualifies for a payment under this section in relation to the relevant Plan change--determine that a payment under this section is not to be made to the entitlement holder in relation to the relevant Plan change.

      * Amount of payment under this section

      * (6) The amount of the payment under this section is worked out as follows:

        * (a) first work out the amount of the reduction in the market value of the entitlement holder's water access entitlement that occurred because of the change in the reliability of the entitlement holder's water allocations;

        * (b) then work out how much of that reduction in market value is reasonably attributable to the Commonwealth's share of the relevant Plan change.

      * (7) In applying paragraph (6)(b), regard is to be had to:

        * (a) any steps taken by the Commonwealth to ensure that holders of water access entitlements do not suffer a change in the reliability of their water allocations as a result of the relevant Plan change; and

        * (b) the effect of those steps on the reliability of the water allocations made to the holders of water access entitlements; and

        * (c) the effect of the other provisions of the Basin Plan.

      * AAT review

      * (8) An application may be made to the Administrative Appeals Tribunal for the review of:

        * (a) a determination of the Minister under paragraph (5)(b); or

        * (b) a determination of the Minister under subparagraph (5)(a)(ii).

      * Substitute entitlements

      * (9) If:

        * (a) a water access entitlement (the **_substitute entitlement_**) is granted, issued or authorised; and

        * (b) the substitute entitlement is granted, issued or authorised in substitution for an equivalent water access right (the **_earlier right_**) that was previously granted, issued or authorised at a particular time;

      * the substitute entitlement is taken, for the purposes of applying paragraph (1)(b), to have been granted, issued or authorised at the time when the earlier right was granted, issued or authorised.

            * Note: This means, for example, that if the earlier right was granted, issued or authorised before 25 January 2007, the substitute entitlement is also taken to have been granted, issued or authorised before 25 January 2007.

      * (10) For the purposes of subsection (9), the substitute entitlement is not equivalent to the earlier right if the amount of water that can be taken under the substitute entitlement is more than the amount of water that could be taken under the earlier right.

##### 84  Applying Subdivision when transitional or interim water resource plan ends

      * (1) This section applies if a transitional water resource plan, or an interim water resource plan, for a water resource plan area is in effect when the Basin Plan first takes effect.

      * (2) This Subdivision applies as if the provisions of the transitional water resource plan, or the interim water resource plan, had been provisions of the Basin Plan.

##### 85  Regulations

      * (1) The regulations may provide for matters that are necessary or convenient to be provided for in relation to claims for payments under section 83.

      * (2) Without limiting subsection (1), the regulations made for the purposes of that subsection may provide for:

        * (a) how a person is to make a claim under section 83; and

        * (b) the time within which the person may make the claim; and

        * (c) the information that the person making a claim must provide in support of the claim; and

        * (d) the procedure to be followed in dealing with the claim; and

        * (e) the method to be used to calculate the change in market value of a water access entitlement in relation to which the claim is made; and

        * (f) the procedure for applying for, and making, determinations under paragraph 83(2)(b).

      * (3) Without limiting subsection (1), the regulations made for the purposes of that subsection may require a Basin State, an agency of a Basin State or another person, to give the Commonwealth, the Authority or another agency of the Commonwealth information for the purposes of dealing with a claim made under section 83.

      * (4) The regulations may make provision in relation to the application of the provisions of the National Water Initiative for the purposes of this Subdivision.

##### 86  Operation of Subdivision

      * (1) This Subdivision imposes obligations on the Commonwealth in relation to changes in the reliability of water allocations only to the extent to which the National Water Initiative provides that the Commonwealth is responsible for those changes.

      * (2) To avoid doubt, this Subdivision does not impose obligations on the Commonwealth merely because of:

        * (a) actions taken by, or on behalf of, the Commonwealth (including purchasing water access rights); or

        * (b) actions taken under the Basin Plan in the exercise of the rights conferred by water access rights held by, or on behalf, of the Commonwealth.

### Part 2AA--Water for the Environment Special Account

##### 86AA  Object of this Part

      * (1) The object of this Part is to enhance the environmental outcomes that can be achieved by the Basin Plan, as in force from time to time, by:

        * (a) protecting and restoring the environmental assets of the MurrayDarling Basin; and

        * (b) protecting biodiversity dependent on the Basin water resources;

      * so as to give effect to relevant international agreements.

      * (2) Without limiting subsection (1), environmental outcomes can be enhanced in the following ways:

        * (a) further reducing salinity levels in the Coorong and Lower Lakes so that improved water quality contributes to the health of insects, fish and plants that form important parts of the food chain, with the aim of achieving the following outcomes:

          * (i) the maximum average daily salinity in the Coorong South Lagoon is less than 100 grams per litre;

          * (ii) the maximum average daily salinity in the Coorong North Lagoon is less than 50 grams per litre;

          * (iii) the average daily salinity in Lake Alexandrina is less than 1000 microsiemens per centimetre for 95% of years and 1500 microsiemens per centimetre all of the time;

        * (b) keeping water levels in the Lower Lakes above:

          * (i) 0.4 metres Australian Height Datum for 95% of the time; and

          * (ii) 0.0 metres Australian Height Datum at all times;

        * to provide additional flows to the Coorong, and to prevent acidification, acid drainage and riverbank collapse below Lock 1;

        * (c) ensuring the mouth of the River Murray is open without the need for dredging in at least 95% of years, with flows every year through the Murray Mouth Barrages;

        * (d) discharging 2 million tonnes of salt per year from the MurrayDarling Basin as a longterm average;

        * (e) further increasing flows to the Coorong through the Murray Mouth Barrages, and supporting fish migration;

        * (f) in conjunction with removing or easing constraints referred to in subparagraph (h)(ii), providing opportunities for environmental watering of an additional 35,000 hectares of floodplains in the River Murray System, to do the following:

          * (i) improve the health of forests and the habitats of fish and birds;

          * (ii) improve connections between the floodplains and rivers in the River Murray System;

          * (iii) replenish groundwater;

        * (g) increasing the flows of rivers and streams, and providing water to low and middle level floodplains and habitats that are adjacent to rivers and streams, in the River Murray System:

          * (i) to enhance environmental outcomes within those floodplains, habitats, rivers and streams; and

          * (ii) to improve connections between those floodplains and habitats, and those rivers and streams;

        * (h) in any other way that is consistent with:

          * (i) the Authority's modelling of the effect of increasing the volume of the Basin water resources that is available for environmental use by 3200 gigalitres; and

          * (ii) easing or removing constraints on the capacity to deliver environmental water to the environmental assets of the MurrayDarling Basin.

      * (3) The object of this Part is to be achieved by:

        * (a) easing or removing constraints on the capacity to deliver environmental water to the environmental assets of the MurrayDarling Basin; and

        * (b) increasing the volume of the Basin water resources that is available for environmental use by 450 gigalitres.

##### 86AB  Water for the Environment Special Account

      * (1) The Water for the Environment Special Account is established by this section.

      * (2) The Account is a special account for the purposes of the _Public Governance, Performance and Accountability Act 2013_.

##### 86AC  Credits to the Water for the Environment Special Account

      * (1) There must be credited to the Water for the Environment Special Account the following amounts:

        * (a) all amounts appropriated by the Parliament for the purposes of that Account;

        * (b) amounts paid by a Basin State, under an agreement between the Commonwealth and the State, for crediting to that Account;

        * (c) amounts received for crediting to that Account by the Commonwealth under any other agreement;

        * (d) amounts equal to money received by the Commonwealth in relation to property paid for with amounts debited from that Account;

        * (e) amounts equal to amounts of any gifts given or bequests made for the purposes of that Account.

            * Note: An Appropriation Act provides for amounts to be credited to a special account if any of the purposes of the special account is a purpose that is covered by an item in the Appropriation Act.

      * (2) Amounts equal to money received by the Commonwealth from the disposal of or other dealings with water access rights paid for with amounts debited from the Water for the Environment Special Account are not to be credited to that Account.

            * Note: Such amounts are instead credited to the Environmental Water Holdings Special Account (see paragraphs 105(2)(a) and 112(1)(b)).

##### 86AD  Purposes of the Water for the Environment Special Account

      * (1) This section sets out the purposes of the Water for the Environment Special Account.

      * (2) Amounts standing to the credit of the Water for the Environment Special Account may be debited for any of the following purposes:

        * (a) making payments in relation to projects whose aim is to further the object of this Part by doing one or more of the following:

          * (i) improving the water efficiency of the infrastructure that uses Basin water resources for irrigation;

          * (ii) improving the water efficiency of any other infrastructure that delivers, stores or drains Basin water resources for the primary purpose of providing water for irrigation;

          * (iii) improving or modifying any infrastructure (including bridges and roads) that constrains the delivery of environmental water to the environmental assets of the MurrayDarling Basin in order to ease or remove those constraints;

          * (iv) better utilising existing dams and storages to deliver environmental water to the environmental assets of the MurrayDarling Basin;

          * (v) entering agreements to acquire an interest in, or in relation to, land (including easements) to facilitate environmental watering of the environmental assets of the MurrayDarling Basin;

          * (vi) improving the rules, policies, practices and procedures in relation to the use and management of the Basin water resources;

        * (b) purchasing water access rights in relation to Basin water resources for the purpose of furthering the object of this Part;

        * (c) making any other payments:

          * (i) in relation to projects whose aim is to further the object of this Part; or

          * (ii) to address any detrimental social or economic impact on the wellbeing of any community in the MurrayDarling Basin that is associated with a project or purchase referred to in paragraph (a) or (b) or subparagraph (c)(i) so as to offset any such impact;

        * (d) meeting the expenses of administering the Account.

            * Note 1: As a result of subsection (4) of this section, water access rights may be purchased only if the purchase is related to an adjustment of a longterm average sustainable diversion limit under section 23A. That section requires the Basin Plan to prescribe criteria in relation to such adjustments. The effect of the criteria prescribed by the Basin Plan is that water access rights may be purchased only in conjunction with improving irrigation water use efficiency on farms or an alternative arrangement proposed by a Basin State.

            * Note 2: Under this Part, the Commonwealth will not conduct open tender rounds that are available to all water access entitlement holders in a water resource plan area to purchase water access rights.

      * (3) For the purposes of this section, the expenses of administering the Water for the Environment Special Account do not include the cost of salaries of the Department.

      * (4) An amount may be debited from the Water for the Environment Special Account for the purpose of making a payment in relation to a project or purchase referred to in paragraph (2)(a) or (b) or subparagraph (2)(c)(i) only if the project or purchase is related to an adjustment of a longterm average sustainable diversion limit for the water resources of a particular water resource plan area (or a particular part of those water resources) under section 23A (whether or not the adjustment has been proposed, and whether or not the adjustment has been adopted as an amendment) because the project or purchase achieves the object of this Part in accordance with subsection 86AA(3).

            * Note: A proposed adjustment may be adopted by the Minister as an amendment of the Basin Plan under subsection 23B(6).

##### 86AE  Commonwealth environmental water holdings

      * (1) To avoid doubt, water access rights acquired by the Commonwealth with amounts debited from the Water for the Environment Special Account form part of the Commonwealth environmental water holdings (see section 108).

            * Note: The Commonwealth Environmental Water Holder must (subject to subsection (2) of this section) dispose or otherwise deal with Commonwealth environmental water holdings in accordance with sections 105 and 106.

      * (2) Paragraphs 105(3)(b) and (4)(b) and 106(2)(b) and (c), and subsection 105(5), do not apply in relation to any water access right that forms part of the Commonwealth environmental water holdings if the water access right was acquired by the Commonwealth with amounts debited from the Water for the Environment Special Account.

##### 86AF  Arrangements to make payments

      * (1) The Minister may, on behalf of the Commonwealth, enter into arrangements and make payments for the purposes of subsection 86AD(2).

      * (2) If a Basin State is granted financial assistance with an amount debited from the Water for the Environment Special Account, the terms and conditions on which that financial assistance is granted are to be set out in a written agreement between the Commonwealth and the Basin State.

##### 86AG  Amounts to be credited to the Water for the Environment Special Account

### Part 2A--Critical human water needs

##### 86A  Critical human water needs to be taken into account in developing Basin Plan

      * (1) Without limiting section 21, the Basin Plan must be prepared having regard to the fact that the Commonwealth and the Basin States have agreed:

        * (a) that critical human water needs are the highest priority water use for communities who are dependent on Basin water resources; and

        * (b) in particular that, to give effect to this priority in the River Murray System, conveyance water will receive first priority from the water available in the system.

      * (2) **_Critical human water needs_** are the needs for a minimum amount of water, that can only reasonably be provided from Basin water resources, required to meet:

        * (a) core human consumption requirements in urban and rural areas; and

        * (b) those nonhuman consumption requirements that a failure to meet would cause prohibitively high social, economic or national security costs.

### Part 11A--Interactions with State laws

##### 250A  Meaning of Commonwealth water legislation

      * In this Act: 

      * **_Commonwealth water legislation_** means this Act, the regulations or any other instrument made under this Act.

##### 250B  Concurrent operation intended

      * (1) The Commonwealth water legislation is not intended to exclude or limit the concurrent operation of any law of a State.

      * (2) If:

        * (a) an act or omission of a person is both an offence against the Commonwealth water legislation and an offence against the law of a State; and

        * (b) the person is convicted of either of those offences;

      * the person is not liable to be convicted of the other of those offences.

      * (3) This section does not apply to a law of a State if there is a direct inconsistency between the Commonwealth water legislation and that law of a State.

            * Note: Section 250D avoids direct inconsistency arising in some cases by limiting the operation of the Commonwealth water legislation.

##### 250C  Commonwealth water legislation does not apply to matters declared by law of referring State to be excluded matters

      * (1) Subsection (2) applies if a provision of a law of a referring State declares a matter to be an excluded matter for the purposes of this section in relation to:

        * (a) the whole of the Commonwealth water legislation; or

        * (b) a specified provision of the Commonwealth water legislation; or

        * (c) the Commonwealth water legislation other than a specified provision; or

        * (d) the Commonwealth water legislation otherwise than to a specified extent.

      * (2) By force of this subsection:

        * (a) none of the provisions of the Commonwealth water legislation (other than this section) applies in or in relation to the State with respect to the matter if the declaration is one to which paragraph (1)(a) applies; and

        * (b) the specified provision of the Commonwealth water legislation does not apply in or in relation to the State with respect to the matter if the declaration is one to which paragraph (1)(b) applies; and

        * (c) the provisions of the Commonwealth water legislation (other than this section and the specified provisions) do not apply in or in relation to the State with respect to the matter if the declaration is one to which paragraph (1)(c) applies; and

        * (d) the provisions of the Commonwealth water legislation (other than this section and otherwise than to the specified extent) do not apply in or in relation to the State with respect to the matter if the declaration is one to which paragraph (1)(d) applies.

      * (3) Subsection (2) does not apply to the declaration to the extent to which the regulations provide that that subsection does not apply to that declaration.

      * (4) In this section:

      * **_matter_** includes act, omission, body, person or thing.

##### 250D  Avoiding direct inconsistency arising between the Commonwealth water legislation and laws of referring States

      * Section overrides other provisions of the Commonwealth water legislation

      * (1) This section has effect despite anything else in the Commonwealth water legislation.

      * Section does not deal with provisions capable of concurrent operation

      * (2) This section does not apply to a provision of a law of a referring State that is capable of concurrent operation with the Commonwealth water legislation.

            * Note: This kind of provision is dealt with by section 250B.

      * When this section applies to a provision of a State law

      * (3) This section applies to the interaction between a provision (the **_State provision_**) of a law of a referring State and a provision (the **_Commonwealth provision_**) of the Commonwealth water legislation only if the State provision is declared by a law of the State to be a Commonwealth water legislation displacement provision for the purposes of this section (either generally or specifically in relation to the Commonwealth provision).

      * State provision specifically permitting, authorising or requiring act or thing to be done

      * (4) The Commonwealth provision does not:

        * (a) prohibit the doing of an act; or

        * (b) impose a liability (whether civil or criminal) for doing an act;

      * if the State provision specifically permits, authorises or requires the doing of that act.

      * Other cases

      * (5) The Commonwealth provision does not operate in or in relation to the State to the extent necessary to ensure that no inconsistency arises between:

        * (a) the Commonwealth provision; and

        * (b) the State provision to the extent to which the State provision would, but for this subsection, be inconsistent with the Commonwealth provision.

            * Note 1: The State provision is not covered by this subsection if subsection (4) applies to the State provision: if that subsection applies there would be no potential inconsistency to be dealt with by this subsection.

            * Note 2: The operation of the State provision will be supported by section 250B to the extent to which it can operate concurrently with the Commonwealth provision.

      * (6) Subsections (4) and (5) do not apply in relation to the State provision to the extent to which the regulations provide that those subsections do not apply in relation to the State provision.

##### 250E  Regulations may modify operation of the Commonwealth water legislation to deal with interaction between that legislation and laws of referring States

      * (1) The regulations may modify the operation of the Commonwealth water legislation so that:

        * (a) provisions of the Commonwealth water legislation do not apply to a matter that is dealt with by a law of a referring State specified in the regulations; or

        * (b) no inconsistency arises between the operation of a provision of the Commonwealth water legislation and the operation of a provision of a law of a referring State specified in the regulations.

      * (2) Without limiting subsection (1), regulations made for the purposes of that subsection may provide that a provision of the Commonwealth water legislation:

        * (a) does not apply to:

          * (i) a person specified in the regulations; or

          * (ii) a body specified in the regulations; or

          * (iii) circumstances specified in the regulations; or

          * (iv) a person or body specified in the regulations in the circumstances specified in the regulations; or

        * (b) does not prohibit an act to the extent to which the prohibition would otherwise give rise to an inconsistency with a law of a referring State; or

        * (c) does not require a person to do an act to the extent to which the requirement would otherwise give rise to an inconsistency with a law of a referring State; or

        * (d) does not authorise a person to do an act to the extent to which the conferral of that authority on the person would otherwise give rise to an inconsistency with a law of a referring State; or

        * (e) does not impose an obligation on a person to the extent to which complying with that obligation would require the person not to comply with an obligation imposed on the person under a law of a referring State; or

        * (f) authorises a person to do something for the purposes of the Commonwealth water legislation that the person:

          * (i) is authorised to do under a law of a referring State; and

          * (ii) would not otherwise be authorised to do under the Commonwealth water legislation; or

        * (g) will be taken to be satisfied if a law of a referring State is satisfied.

           * (ii) at any other time, the first 16,700 megalitres per month (being equivalent to the ceding by Victoria to New South Wales of a volume of 8,350 megalitres per month),

        * shall be allocated to New South Wales, and the remainder shall be allocated half each to New South Wales and Victoria. 

   * 107.	Allocation of Water in Menindee Lake Storage 

      * (1) Half the water entering the Menindee Lakes Storage from the Darling River is allocated to New South Wales and half to Victoria. 

      * (2) Of the water allocated to Victoria and stored in the Menindee Lakes Storage, Victoria must cede 4,170 megalitres each month to New South Wales. 

   * 108.	Tributary Inflows 

      * (1) The quantity of water which in any period enters the upper River Murray downstream of Doctors Point from a tributary, or from any artificial outfall approved by the Ministerial Council for the purposes of this clause, other than quantities referred to in clause 107, is allocated to the State from which the water enters the upper River Murray. 

      * (2) The volume of water calculated in accordance with subclause 11(1) of Schedule F is allocated to New South Wales. 

      * (3) The volume of water calculated in accordance with subclause 11(2) of Schedule F is allocated to Victoria. 

   * 109.	Use by New South Wales and Victoria of Allocated Water 

      * New South Wales and Victoria are respectively deemed to use the quantity of water: 

        * (a) diverted from the upper River Murray by an offtake under the jurisdiction of that State, unless the Ministerial Council determines otherwise; and 

        * (b) calculated under subclause 12(1) of Schedule F, in the case of New South Wales; and 

        * (c) calculated under subclause 12(2) of Schedule F, in the case of Victoria.

      * (3) For the purposes of this clause an "unregulated flow" means a flow which has not been planned by the Authority. 

   * 111	New South Wales' and Victoria's Supply to South Australia

      * (1) For the purposes of this Subdivision:

        * (a) any water supplied in any month to South Australia which it is entitled to receive in that month under clause 88 or 90 is taken to be provided by New South Wales and Victoria in equal proportions; and 

        * (b) any water stored by South Australia under clause 91 of the Agreement is taken to be provided by New South Wales and Victoria in equal proportions, at the time when that water is stored in accordance with Schedule G.

      * (2) The Authority must make appropriate adjustments to the allocation of water to New South Wales and Victoria in the upper River Murray so as to give effect to those States' obligations under clause 96.

   * 112.	Commencement of Continuous Accounting of Carryover of Stored Water 

      * Half the water in each major storage on 1 December 1989 is deemed to have been allocated to New South Wales and half to Victoria. 

   * 113.	Reallocation of Water Between New South Wales and Victoria 

      * (1) By agreement between New South Wales and Victoria, any quantity of water allocated to one of those States and in store in any of the upper River Murray storages or in transit in a specified part of the upper River Murray, may be exchanged for a quantity of water allocated to the other State and in store in another of the upper River Murray storages or in transit in another specified part of the upper River Murray, if such an exchange of water does not prejudice the entitlement of South Australia. 

      * (2) The Authority may at any time, with the consent of either New South Wales or Victoria, determine that certain quantities of water in transit in the upper River Murray are surplus to the requirements of that State and reallocate the whole or part of such quantities from that State to the other State. 

   * 114.	Efficient Regulation of the River Murray

      * Any water used by either New South Wales or Victoria or supplied to South Australia by either of those States is deemed to be provided from water allocated to that State and the Authority may, as necessary to ensure the availability of appropriately allocated water at the place of such use or supply, reallocate quantities of water in the upper River Murray but must not thereby alter the total quantities of water allocated to New South Wales or Victoria respectively, in the upper River Murray. 

   * 115.	Accounting Procedures 

      * Subject to clauses 112, 113, 114, 116 and 121, the quantity of water in any part of the upper River Murray and which is allocated to either New South Wales or Victoria is deemed: 

        * (a) to increase in any period by the quantity of water allocated to that State flowing into that part in that period; and 

        * (b) to decrease in any period by any quantities of water  

           * (i) used by that State by way of diversion or loss from that part in that period; or 

           * (ii) passed from that part in that period for  

            *    	downstream use by that State, 

            *    	supply by that State to South Australia, 

            *    	conveyance to another part of the upper River Murray as water allocated to that State; or 

           * (iii) released from that part in that period and determined under clause 122 to be a release of water allocated to that State; or 

           * (iv) spilled from that part in that period and deemed under clause 117 to be a spill of water allocated to that State.

   * 116.	Internal Spills 

      * (1) In any major storage, water allocated either to New South Wales or Victoria must be reallocated to the other State to prevent the quantity of water allocated to either State in the storage exceeding half the lesser of: 

        * (a) the target capacity of the storage; or 

        * (b) the quantity of water stored when releases are being made for flood mitigation. 

      * (2) In Hume and Lake Victoria, "target capacity" means the capacity of the reservoir at the Full Supply Level. 

      * (3) In Dartmouth "target capacity" means the lesser of: 

        * (a) the capacity of the reservoir at the Full Supply Level; or 

        * (b) the quantity of water stored when water is being released through the hydroelectric power station and the storage level is above the level specified by the Ministerial Council for the operation of the power station. 

      * (4) In Menindee Lakes "target capacity" means the greater of the capacity: 

        * (a) at the Full Supply Level; or 

        * (b) at such higher level as may be determined from time to time by the Ministerial Council. 

      * (5) When water in Dartmouth Reservoir is to be reallocated under subclause (1) and there is capacity in Hume Reservoir available to the State from which water is to be reallocated to store some or all of the reallocated water, a compensating adjustment must be made in Hume Reservoir so that the accounts of the State from which the water is to be reallocated in Dartmouth Reservoir are not thereby reduced.

   * 117.	Accounting for Spill from Storages 

      * Any quantity of water spilled from any of the upper River Murray storages, including water released solely to provide space for the retention of floodwaters, is deemed to be water spilled out of the waters allocated to New South Wales or Victoria respectively, in such proportions as minimizes the reallocation of water under subclause 116(1).

   * 118.	Accounting for Releases from Dartmouth Reservoir 

      * (1) Whenever the storage level in Dartmouth Reservoir is above the level determined for the purposes of this subclause by the Ministerial Council, releases made from Dartmouth Reservoir through the hydroelectric power station will be deemed to be spills and will be accounted for as provided in clause 117. 

      * (2) No release from Dartmouth Reservoir will be attributable to the allocation of water to New South Wales or Victoria if the quantity of water in Dartmouth Reservoir allocated to that State is less than or equal to half the minimum operating storage in the reservoir. 

      * (3) Releases from Dartmouth Reservoir other than those covered by subclauses (1) and (2) will be attributable to the allocation of water to New South Wales or Victoria in such proportions as tend most to equalize the quantities of water allocated to those States in Hume Reservoir. 

   * 119.	Accounting for Releases from Hume Reservoir 

      * (1) Any release made from Hume Reservoir for the deliberate purpose of transferring water to Lake Victoria for use at a later date will be attributable to the allocation of water to New South Wales or Victoria in such proportions as tend most to equalize the quantities of water allocated to the respective States in Lake Victoria and the Menindee Lakes Storage. 

      * (2) Releases from Hume Reservoir other than those covered by subclause (1) will be attributable to the allocation of water to New South Wales or Victoria in such proportions as satisfy the expected downstream water requirements of each State. 

   * 120.	Accounting for Releases from Menindee Lakes Storage 

      * (1) For the purposes of this clause releases from Menindee Lakes Storage consist of: 

        * (a) water required to maintain a flow throughout the main course of the Darling River downstream of Menindee Lakes; 

        * (b) water released to satisfy use by New South Wales in the main course of the Darling River downstream of Menindee Lakes; 

        * (c) water released through the Lake Cawndilla Outlet Regulator; 

        * (d) water released down the main course of the Darling River downstream of Menindee Lakes Storage to satisfy directions given by the Authority under subclause 98(1);

      * (2) Whenever New South Wales is using water pursuant to subclause 95(1) all release from Menindee Lakes Storage will be attributed to the allocation of water to New South Wales. 

      * (3) Whenever subclause 95(1) does not apply to the use of water by New South Wales from the Menindee Lakes Storage: 

        * (a) releases under paragraph (1)(a) will be attributed equally to the allocations of water to New South Wales and Victoria; 

        * (b) releases under paragraph (1)(b) and (1)(c) will be attributed to the allocation of water to New South Wales; 

        * (c) releases under paragraph (1)(d) and (1)(e) will be attributed to the respective allocations of New South Wales and Victoria in such proportions as tend most to equalize the water in Lake Victoria allocated to each State, provided that such proportions do not  

           * (i) cause the water allocated either to New South Wales or to Victoria to fall below 240,000 megalitres; 

           * (ii) cause water to be reallocated between the States under clause 116. 

   * 121.	Reallocation of Water in Menindee Lakes Storage 

      * At the conclusion of any period during which New South Wales is using water pursuant to subclause 95(1), the quantities of water stored in the Menindee Lakes Storage and allocated respectively to New South Wales and Victoria must be adjusted so that the difference between those quantities is the same as the difference in the allocated quantities at the beginning of that period. 

   * 122.	Accounting for Dilution Flows 

      * (1) Whenever the Authority directs under clause 98 that the flow of water is to exceed the water order at a particular point, unless the Ministerial Council determines otherwise, the proportion of the water order attributed respectively to New South Wales and Victoria must be increased by such amounts as tend most to equalise the respective allocations to New South Wales and Victoria of the total flow at that point. 

      * (2) For the purpose of this clause the "water order" is the flow of water at a particular point which is necessary: 

        * (a) to meet diversions by New South Wales and Victoria, losses and dilution flows downstream of that point; 

        * (b) to meet South Australia's entitlement; and 

        * (c) to supply storages downstream of that point.

     * **less:**

     * **Twothirds of the amount calculated under paragraph 125(c). 

   * 127.	Limits on Imbalance in Use 

      * On May 31 in any period of special accounting, the accounts kept under clause 125 must be adjusted by the Authority to ensure that the imbalance in use calculated under clause 126 is: 

        * (a) less than onethird; and 

        * (b) greater than minus twothirds,

      * of the difference between 1,250,000 megalitres and the reserve allocated to New South Wales or Victoria, as the case may require. 

   * 128.	Restrictions on South Australia's Entitlement 

      * (1) Subject to subclause 102C (4), in a period of special accounting, instead of the amounts set out in paragraph 88(a), South Australia is entitled to receive, before the end of the following May, the lesser of: 

        * (a) the sum of the monthly quantities set out in paragraph 88(a); and

      * (1) Subject to paragraph 16(7)(a), the Authority must, from time to time, adjust the cap on diversions for each designated river valley to reflect interstate and intervalley transfers of entitlements or allocations under this Schedule, in order to ensure that diversions within the MurrayDarling Basin do not exceed the total diversions under baseline conditions referred to in Schedule E. 

      * (2) For the purpose of making any calculation under clause 12 of Schedule E, the relevant annual diversion target for that year must either be increased or reduced, as the case requires, by the volume determined in accordance with Appendix 3. 

   * 9.	Adjustment of State financial contributions 

      * (1) In every year, the Authority must, based on information contained in the Transfer Register, calculate the amount by which any sum payable by a State Contracting Government in any year under Part IX of the Agreement, should be varied to reflect transfers of entitlements made by exchange rate trade from river reaches regulated by works subject to the Agreement, into or out of that State in the preceding year and inform the Ministerial Council of that amount for the purposes of clause 72 of the Agreement. 

      * (2) The Ministerial Council may add or subtract, as the case requires, any amount determined under subclause 9(1) to or from the sum payable by a State Contracting Government in the next following year, under Part IX of the Agreement.

    * **Note: **

      * **	(a) Where an interstate transfer, made either by exchange rate trade or tagged trade, relates to water in a tributary of the River Murray, the recovery of State bulk water charges relating to that water is a matter for agreement between the relevant States. 

      *  (b) Where tagged trade occurs, a transferee in the State of destination holds an entitlement which continues to exist in the State of origin. A State of origin might recover bulk water charges either directly from the holder of the entitlement in the State of destination, or through the relevant water authority in that State, as agreed between the parties. 

   * 10.	Accounting for salinity impacts 

      * (1) An entitlement or allocation can only be transferred under this Schedule if the proposed transfer is consistent with Schedule B.

        * (b) exchange rates to be applied under this Schedule: 

           * (i) to any transfer of an entitlement by exchange rate trade; and 

           * (ii) to any transfer of an entitlement by tagged trade or to any transfer of an allocation, 

        * and must publish any such conversion factors and exchange rates in such manner as it thinks fit. 

      * (2) An exchange rate referred to in subparagraph 12(1)(b)(ii) must only be made to take into account either or both of: 

        * (a) any changes in distribution losses; and 

        * (b) any differences in utilization, 

      * resulting from the transfer. 

      * (3) A conversion factor and an exchange rate determined or altered by the Authority operates prospectively and cannot be used to alter:

##### SCHEDULE D--APPENDIX 3--Adjusting Cap on Diversions


**(see clause 8)**

   * **1.	Definitions 

      *  For the purposes of this Appendix: 

      * **cap required, **with respect to a unit of a type of entitlement, means the product of that unit multiplied by the appropriate cap factor referred to in paragraph 8(c). 

      * **effective date **means the beginning of the year in which this Appendix comes into effect. 

PART I--ADJUSTING FOR TRANSFERRED ALLOCATIONS 

   * 2.	Adjusting cap for transferred allocations 

      * The annual diversion target for a designated river valley, referred to in subclause 12(1) of Schedule E, must either be increased or reduced, as the case requires, by the volume of any interstate or intervalley transfers of allocations into or out of that designated river valley in that year, multiplied by the appropriate cap transfer rate set out in Table 1 of a protocol made under paragraph 6(1)(a) of the Schedule. 

PART II--ADJUSTING FOR ENTITLEMENTS TRANSFERRED BY TAGGED TRADE 

   * 3.	Cap adjustment for tagged trade 

      * The annual diversion target for a designated river valley referred to in subclause 12(1) of Schedule E must be: 

        * (a) increased by the volume of water diverted in that designated river valley in that year, which is attributable to entitlements tagged to another designated river valley; and 

        * (b) reduced by the volume of water attributable to entitlements tagged to that designated river valley, which is diverted in any other designated river valley in that year. 

PART III--ADJUSTING FOR ENTITLEMENTS TRANSFERRED BETWEEN 1 JULY 1994 AND THE EFFECTIVE DATE, USING EXCHANGE RATES 

   * 4.	Interim register 

      * The Authority must establish and maintain an interim register which records the volume of any entitlement transferred from a designated river valley to another designated river valley during each year between 1 July 1994 and the effective date. 

   * 5.	Adjusting annual diversion targets 

      * Each year, the Authority must calculate the adjustment to the annual diversion target for a designated river valley for transfers recorded on the interim register referred to in clause 4, by: 

        * (a) _multiplying _the cumulative volume of every entitlement of a particular type transferred into the designated river valley between 1 July 1994 and the earlier of the beginning of that year and the effective date, by the appropriate cap transfer rate set out in Table 2 of a protocol made under paragraph 6(1)(a) of the Schedule; and 

        * (b) _multiplying _the cumulative volume of every entitlement of a particular type transferred out of the designated river valley between 1 July 1994 and the earlier of the beginning of that year and the effective date, by the appropriate cap transfer rate; and 

        * (c) _subtracting _the product of (b) from the product of (a). 

PART IV--ADJUSTING FOR ENTITLEMENTS TRANSFERRED OR CONVERTED AFTER THE EFFECTIVE DATE, USING EXCHANGE RATES 

   * 6.	Object of Part 

      * The object of this Part is, subject to subclause 8(1) of the Schedule, to minimise the impact of transfers or conversion of entitlements on entitlements held by third parties, by endeavouring to ensure that: 

        * (a) the proportion of the cap associated with each unit of a particular type of entitlement remains the same after an entitlement has been transferred or converted as it was before that transfer or conversion; and 

        * (b) the annual diversion target for each State and designated river valley referred to in subclause 12(1) of Schedule E is adjusted accordingly. 

   * 7.	Operation of Part 

      * This Part applies to entitlements transferred or converted after the effective date. 

   * 8.	Calculating increases in cap required 

      * Based on information set out in the Transfer Register, the Authority must make the following calculations for every year, in respect of each designated river valley, as a consequence of transfers between that designated river valley and every other designated river valley: 

        * (a) The **volume of each type of entitlement **into which former entitlements were transferred or converted, as recorded under subparagraphs 16(3)(b)(ii) and 16(3)(a)(ii) of this Schedule. 

        * (b) The **net increase in each type of entitlement**, by subtracting the volume of that type of entitlement recorded under subparagraphs 16(3)(a)(iii) and 16(3)(a)(i) of this Schedule from the volume of that type of entitlement calculated under paragraph 8(a). 

        * (c) The **net increase in the cap required **for each type of entitlement , by multiplying the result of the calculation in paragraph 8(b) by the relevant cap factor set out in Table 3 of a protocol made under paragraph 6(1)(a) of the Schedule. 

   * 9.	Adjusting annual diversion targets 

      * (1) The Authority must, in each year, alter each longterm diversion cap to reflect the results of transferring entitlements, pursuant to paragraph 10(2)(a) of Schedule E, by adjusting annual diversion targets. 

      * (2) The Authority must adjust each annual diversion target by following any protocol made by the Authority under paragraph 6(1)(a) of the Schedule, to implement the Stages set out below. 

**Stage 1 **

        * **Adjust annual diversion targets, as far as possible by allocating to the cap required in a designated river valley of destination, so much of the volume of cap no longer required in the designated river valley of origin as is required in the designated river valley of destination. A separate calculation must be made for the interaction between each designated river valley and every other designated river valley, based on information collated from the Transfer Register. 

**Stage 2 **

        * **Pool any cap surpluses and deficits calculated under Stage 1 in relation to each designated river valley, in order to reduce any shortfalls in each designated river valley. 

        * Where lower reliability entitlements have been converted to higher reliability entitlements within a designated river valley, the net effect of that conversion on the cap attributable to that valley must be included in the pool. However: 

        * (a) a shortfall within a designated river valley caused by such conversions cannot be reduced by attributing a surplus existing in another designated river valley; and 

        * (b) the volume pooled with respect to a designated river valley cannot exceed the sum of the deficits arising in other designated river valleys, as a result of transfers between that designated river valley and other designated river valleys. 

**Stage 3 **

        * **(a)	Calculate any cap surplus resulting from Stage 2 for each designated river valley. 

        * (b) Then allocate any of that cap surplus that is attributable to interstate transfers into or from that designated river valley to the environment, by 

        * (c) reducing the annual diversion target for that designated river valley by the portion of the surplus referred to in paragraph (b).

##### SCHEDULE G	Accounting for south Australia's storage rights


PART 1 - PRELIMINARY

   * 1.	Purposes of Schedule G

      * The purposes of this Schedule are, in accordance with clause 130 of the Agreement:

        * (a) to set out rules for giving effect to, and accounting for, South Australia's storage rights under clause 91 of the Agreement; and

        * (b) to define what constitutes an effect on water availability and an effect on storage access for that clause.

   * 2.	Definitions and Interpretation

      * (1) In this Schedule except where inconsistent with the context:

      * "**account**" means an account maintained under subclause 20 (1).

      * "allocation" has the meaning given in Schedule D.

      * "**deferred water**" means:

        * (a) any part of South Australia's entitlement under clause 88 of the Agreement that South Australia stores under clause 91 of the Agreement; and

        * (b) any allocations South Australia may have acquired for use in South Australia from within an upper State, the delivery of which has been deferred in accordance with this Schedule.

      * **"entitlement"** has the meaning given in Schedule D.

      * **"major storage"** means any one of the major storages defined by the Agreement.

      * **"Plan"** means a Deferred Water Storage and Delivery Plan approved in accordance with clause 7.

      * **"prerelease"** means to release water from a major storage solely for the purpose of creating capacity in the major storage to be used to mitigate downstream flooding.

      * **"reregulate"** means to control water released from an upstream major storage in a downstream major storage, when the water was released for a purpose other than a planned transfer of water to the downstream major storage.

      * **"substitute"** means to alter an account to substitute a volume of water to be shown as being stored in an upstream major storage for an equivalent volume of water previously shown as being stored in a downstream major storage.

      * **"transfer"** means to transfer a volume of water held in an upstream major storage to a downstream major storage.

      * **"unused capacity"**, for a major storage at any time, means the capacity not then used by an upper State, comprising the difference between:

        * (a) the lesser of:

           * (i) the target capacity of the major storage as set out in clause 116 of the Agreement; and

           * (ii) if the Authority thinks there is a risk that water may have to be released from that major storage for flood mitigation--the volume of water that the Authority estimates will be held in the major storage when the release occurs; and

        * (b) the volume in storage and attributed to the upper States at that time.

      * **"upper State" **means each of New South Wales and Victoria.

      * **"year"** means the 12 months beginning on 1 June.

      * (2) Expressions used in this Schedule and in the _Water Act 2007_ (Commonwealth) or the Agreement that are not defined in this Schedule have the same meanings as in the Act or the Agreement.

      * (3) Clause 3 of the Agreement applies to this Schedule as if a reference to the Agreement in the clause were a reference to this Schedule.

      * (4) For clause 91 and paragraph 130 (6) (b) of the Agreement, storing water after the time when a part of South Australia's entitlement would otherwise have been delivered:

        * (a) will have an effect on water availability for an upper State if continuing to store the part of South Australia's entitlement in accordance with the Plan, or any approved departure from the Plan, either reduces the volume of water available for allocation by the upper State or limits its ability to store any part of the State water entitlement of the upper State; and

        * (b) will have an effect on storage access by an upper State if delivering part of South Australia's entitlement that South Australia has continued to store in accordance with the Plan, or any approved departure from the Plan, limits the Authority's ability to deliver any part of the State water entitlement of the upper State because limitations on the capacity of either or both:

           * (i) river channels to carry the necessary flow; or

           * (ii) a major storage to release sufficient water;

        * affect the ability to deliver the State water entitlements of both States simultaneously.

      * (5) The Authority must determine when an effect mentioned in paragraph (4) (a) or (4) (b) has occurred, taking into account any relevant Plan, other provisions of this Schedule and any other relevant circumstances.

      * (6) Whenever the Authority is required to form an opinion for this Schedule, it must do so reasonably in all the circumstances, and must take into account any relevant prevailing professional standards.

   * 3.	Commencement

      * (1) The Committee member for South Australia may request the Authority in writing to reduce the quantity of water that it would otherwise receive in any month under the Agreement, by a volume to be designated as deferred water under this Schedule.

      * (2) If a request made under subclause (1) is not in accordance with the Plan approved under clause 7, the request must be taken to be a proposal for a departure from arrangements mentioned in that Plan, made under paragraph 7 (9) (b) and dealt with accordingly. 

      * (3) If a request made under subclause (1) is either:

        * (a) in accordance with the Plan; or

        * (b) approved as a departure from the Plan;

      * the volume mentioned in subclause (1) becomes deferred water for this Schedule at the time when the reduced quantity of water is released for delivery to South Australia.

   * 10.	Where deferred water may be stored

      * (1) South Australia may store deferred water within the unused capacity of one or more major storages.

      * (2) Subject to subclauses (3) and (4), any deferred water stored after the date this Schedule comes into effect must initially be held in the major storage from which the Authority determines that water would have been supplied, if its delivery had not been deferred.

      * (3) If the source of any deferred water stored after the date this Schedule comes into effect is a tributary of the River Murray downstream of Hume Dam, the deferred water must initially be held in Lake Victoria.

      * (4) Subclauses (2) and (3) apply whether the deferred water is either:

        * (a) part of South Australia's entitlement under clause 88 of the Agreement, that is stored under clause 91 of the Agreement; or

        * (b) allocations acquired for use in South Australia from within an upper State.

   * 11.	Transferring deferred water downstream

      * (1) Subject to subclauses (5) and (6), the Authority must transfer deferred water from an upstream major storage to a downstream major storage in accordance with those provisions of a Plan, or approved departure from a Plan, that apply during minimum inflow conditions, or other inflow conditions specified in the Plan.

      * (2) Despite subclause (1) but subject to subclauses (5) and (6), the Authority may transfer deferred water from an upstream major storage to a downstream major storage at any time, at the request of the Committee member for South Australia.

      * (3) Despite subclause (1) but subject to subclauses (5) and (6), the Authority must, with the prior written consent of the Committee member for South Australia, transfer deferred water from an upstream major storage to a downstream major storage at any time when, in the Authority's opinion, a transfer of deferred water is required for the purpose of delivering water for the remainder of the year.

      * (4) If the Committee member for South Australia fails to consent to a transfer proposed under subclause (3), the Authority must reduce the delivery of deferred water in accordance with the Plan or approved departure from a Plan for the remainder of the year, by the amount of the proposed transfer.

      * (5) The Authority must not transfer deferred water under subclause (1), (2) or (3) if, in the opinion of the Authority, transferring the deferred water would have an effect on either or both of:

        * (a) water availability for an upper State; and

      * (8) Subject to subclause (9), the Authority must debit the account for the major storage with any deferred water transferred under this clause.

      * (9) The Authority must credit the account for a downstream major storage with any deferred water transferred to the major storage under this clause when, in the Authority's opinion, the deferred water has reached the downstream major storage.

   * 12.	Substituting deferred water upstream

      * (1) Unless the Plan, or an approved departure from the Plan, provides otherwise, whenever:

        * (a) the volume of deferred water held in a downstream storage exceeds the volume of deferred water to be delivered under the Plan, or an approved departure from the Plan, during the remainder of the year; and

        * (b) the Authority, for the purpose of normal river operations, is required to transfer a volume of water from an upstream storage to a downstream storage; and

        * (c) in the Authority's view, it would be practicable to use a volume of water held in the downstream storage for the purpose mentioned in paragraph (b); 

      * the Authority must substitute the deferred water held in the downstream storage for water held in an upstream storage.

      * (2) For subclause (1), substituting deferred water held in a downstream storage for water held in an upstream storage includes substituting deferred water held in the Menindee Lakes Storage for water held in the Hume Reservoir.

      * (3) The Authority must progressively adjust the relevant accounts of the upper States and South Australia maintained under Subdivisions D and E of Division 1 of Part XII of the Agreement as deferred water is substituted from a major storage to another in accordance with subclause (1) to reflect the effect of each substitution of deferred water.

PART 3 - DELIVERING DEFERRED WATER

   * 13.	Deferred water delivered at South Australia's request

      * (1) Subject to subclause (2), except for deferred water that spills from a major storage, the Authority must only deliver deferred water from a major storage to South Australia in accordance with a Plan or departure from a Plan approved under clause 7.

      * (2) Despite subclause (1), the Authority may deliver deferred water to South Australia at any time, at the request of the Committee member for South Australia.

      * (3) The Authority may only decide not to deliver deferred water in accordance with subclause (1) or (2) if, in the opinion of the Authority, prevailing circumstances for river operations make it impractical to do so.

      * (4) The Authority must give written reasons to the Committee member for South Australia and for each upper State if it decides not to deliver deferred water in accordance with subclause (1) or (2).

   * 14.	Power to cancel delivery

      * (1) The Committee member for South Australia may cancel a delivery of deferred water under subclause 13 (1), or a request made to the Authority to deliver deferred water under subclause 13 (2) by writing to the Authority.

      * (2) If the Authority receives a cancellation under subclause (1) after giving directions to release deferred water, the Authority must either:

        * (a) store in a downstream major storage any deferred water released for delivery to South Australia before the Authority directs that the delivery of deferred water should cease; or

        * (b) if, in the Authority's opinion it is not possible to comply with paragraph (a), debit that deferred water to the relevant account.

   * 15.	Deferred water not part of South Australia's entitlement

      * Any deferred water delivered for use in South Australia during any period under this Schedule is in addition to, and is not part of, other water delivered to South Australia under the Agreement in the same period.

   * 16.	South Australia's exclusive right to use deferred water

      * Unless the Committee member for South Australia and the Committee member for an upper State agree otherwise, and subject to subclause 17 (4), the upper State must not divert any water that is taken to be deferred water by the Authority.

   * 17.	Spills and prereleases

      * (1) If:

        * (a) water spills from a major storage in which deferred water is stored; or

        * (b) water is prereleased from a major storage, in which deferred water is stored, for flood mitigation purposes;

      * the water must be taken to be deferred water, until a volume equivalent to the volume of deferred water stored in the major storage immediately before the relevant event has either spilled or been prereleased.

      * (2) In measuring the volume of water spilled or prereleased under subclause (1), deferred water stored for the purpose of meeting private carryover must be taken to have spilled or been prereleased before any deferred water stored for the purpose of meeting critical human water needs.

      * (3) The Authority must, whenever possible, reregulate any water taken to be deferred water under subclause (1) in a downstream major storage, for use by South Australia.

      * (4) If the Authority is unable to reregulate spilled or prereleased deferred water in accordance with subclause (3), the water must be accounted for as environmental flows.

      * (5) If there is deferred water in Dartmouth Reservoir and water is transferred from Dartmouth Reservoir to Hume Reservoir, with the effect of increasing the likelihood that each of these major storages will spill simultaneously:

        * (a) the deferred water is taken to be transferred first and becomes deferred water in Hume Reservoir; and

        * (b) deferred water for the purpose of meeting private carryover is taken to be transferred before any deferred water stored for the purposes of meeting critical human water needs.

   * 18.	Limitations on channels and storages 

      * Unless the Committee determines otherwise, either generally or in a particular case, whenever the delivery of water is restricted due to either or both of limitations on the capacity:

        * (a) of river channels to carry that flow; or

        * (b) a major storage to release sufficient water to meet the commitments of any State to supply allocations at any time; 

      * then delivery of deferred water for the purpose of meeting private carryover must be given the lowest priority.

   * 19.	Reallocation of deferred water

      * (1) Despite Part 2 and this Part, but subject to subclause (2), the Authority may reallocate volumes of deferred water between major storages and adjust the accounts accordingly if, after considering the relevant Plan, the Authority considers that it is necessary or convenient to do so in order to:

        * (a) facilitate the delivery of deferred water to South Australia; or

        * (b) assist in reregulating any deferred water that may have spilled from a major storage; or

        * (c) operate the River Murray System efficiently.

      * (2) In reallocating deferred water under subclause (1), the Authority must not:

        * (a) reduce the total volume of deferred water then held in all major storages and entered in the accounts; or

        * (b) affect either or both of:

           * (i) water availability for an upper State; or

           * (ii) for deferred water stored for the purpose of meeting private carryover in South Australia--storage access by an upper State; or

        * (c) increase the risk that deferred water might spill from a major storage.

PART 4 - ACCOUNTING FOR DEFERRED WATER

   * 20.	Establishing and maintaining accounts

      * (1) The Authority must, in accordance with the requirements of this Part, establish and maintain:

        * (a) a separate account for deferred water held in each major storage showing the respective volumes stored at any time for the purpose of meeting:

           * (i) critical human water needs; and

           * (ii) private carryover; and

        * (b) an account showing the total deferred water held at any time; and

        * (c) an account that maintains a record of deferred water that is stored, spilled, in transit, debited for evaporation or attributed as transmission losses under clause 26 and delivered to South Australia in accordance with this Schedule.

      * (2) The Authority must give a copy of each account mentioned in subclause (1) to each Committee member at the same time as the water accounts prepared under Subdivisions D and E of Division 1 of Part XII of the Agreement. 

      * (3) If the Authority makes a determination under subclause 2 (5) about the occurrence of an effect under paragraph 2 (4) (a) or (b), the Authority must immediately:

        * (a) notify each Committee member in writing of that effect and of any adjustment to the accounts maintained under clause 20 that the Authority considers appropriate to correct that effect; and

        * (b) make any adjustment to the accounts determined by the Committee.

   * 21.	Accounting for internal spills

      * The volume of deferred water in a major storage must not be taken into account when reallocating water in the major storage under clause 116 of the Agreement.

   * 22.	Attribution of evaporative losses

      * (1) The Authority must calculate and attribute to South Australia any incremental evaporative losses arising from the storage of deferred water in accordance with subclause (2) and any rules made under subclause 130 (12) of the Agreement.

      * (2) For subclause (1), the Authority must:

        * (a) calculate the volume of the total net evaporative loss from all major storages; and

        * (b) estimate the volume of the total net evaporative loss that would have occurred from all major storages if no water had been stored as deferred water; and

        * (c) subtract the volume estimated under paragraph (b) from the volume calculated under paragraph (a).

   * 23.	Accounting for deferred water in Menindee Lakes Storage

      * Deferred water stored for private carryover

      * (1) Subclauses (2) and (3) apply whenever New South Wales becomes entitled to use water in Menindee Lakes Storage under subclause 95 (1) of the Agreement.

    * The map set out in this Schedule delineates the boundaries of the MurrayDarling Basin but does not show all of the water resources within the MurrayDarling Basin that are covered by this Act.

## Schedule 2--Basin water charging objectives and principles

    * Note: See section 4.

### Part 1--Preliminary

##### 1  Objectives and principles

      * This Schedule sets out: 

        * (a) the Basin water charging objectives; and

        * (b) the Basin water charging principles.

            * Note 1: These objectives and principles are relevant to the formulation of water charge rules under section 92 of this Act.

            * Note 2: These objectives and principles are based on those set out in clauses 64 to 77 of the National Water Initiative when Part 2 of this Act commences.

### Part 2--Water charging objectives

##### 2  Water charging objectives

      * The **_water charging objectives_** are:

        * (a) to promote the economically efficient and sustainable use of:

          * (i) water resources; and

          * (ii) water infrastructure assets; and

          * (iii) government resources devoted to the management of water resources; and

        * (b) to ensure sufficient revenue streams to allow efficient delivery of the required services; and

        * (c) to facilitate the efficient functioning of water markets (including interjurisdictional water markets, and in both rural and urban settings); and

        * (d) to give effect to the principles of userpays and achieve pricing transparency in respect of water storage and delivery in irrigation systems and cost recovery for water planning and management; and

        * (e) to avoid perverse or unintended pricing outcomes.

### Part 3--Water charging principles

##### 3  Water storage and delivery

      * (1) Pricing policies for water storage and delivery in rural systems are to be developed to facilitate efficient water use and trade in water entitlements.

      * (2) Water charges are to include a consumptionbased component.

      * (3) Water charges are to be based on full cost recovery for water services to ensure business viability and avoid monopoly rents, including recovery of environmental externalities where feasible and practical.

      * (4) Water charges in the rural water sector are to continue to move towards upper bound pricing where practicable.

      * (5) In subclause (4):

      * **_upper bound pricing_** means the level at which, to avoid monopoly rents, a water business should not recover more than:

        * (a) the operational, maintenance and administrative costs, externalities, taxes or tax equivalent regimes; and

        * (b) provision for the cost of asset consumption; and

        * (c) provision for the cost of capital (calculated using a weighted average cost of capital).

      * (6) If full cost recovery is unlikely to be achieved and a Community Service Obligation is deemed necessary:

        * (a) the size of the subsidy is to be reported publicly; and

        * (b) where practicable, subsidies or Community Service Obligations are to be reduced or eliminated.

      * (7) Pricing policies should ensure consistency across sectors and jurisdictions where entitlements are able to be traded.

##### 4  Cost recovery for planning and management

      * (1) All costs associated with water planning and management must be identified, including the costs of underpinning water markets (such as the provision of registers, accounting and measurement frameworks and performance monitoring and benchmarking).

      * (2) The proportion of costs that can be attributed to water access entitlement holders is to be identified consistently with the principles set out in subclauses (3) and (4).

      * (3) Water planning and management charges are to be linked as closely as possible to the costs of activities or products.

      * (4) Water planning and management charges are to exclude activities undertaken for the Government (such as policy development and Ministerial or Parliamentary services).

      * (5) States and Territories are to report publicly on cost recovery for water planning and management annually. The reports are to include:

        * (a) the total cost of water planning and management; and

        * (b) the proportion of the total cost of water planning and management attributed to water access entitlement holders, and the basis upon which this proportion is determined.

##### 5  Environmental externalities

      * (1) Marketbased mechanisms (such as pricing to account for positive and negative environmental externalities associated with water use) are to be pursued where feasible.

      * (2) The cost of environmental externalities is to be included in water charges where found to be feasible.

##### 6  Benchmarking and efficiency reviews

      * (1) Independent and public benchmarking or efficiency reviews of pricing and service quality relevant to regulated water charges is or are to be undertaken based on a nationally consistent framework.

      * (2) The costs of operating these benchmarking and efficiency review systems are to be met through recovery of regulated water charges.

## Schedule 3--Basin water market and trading objectives and principles

    * Note: See section 4.

##### 1  Definitions

      * In this Schedule: 

      * **_exchange rate_** means the rate of conversion to be applied to water to be traded from one trading zone and/or jurisdiction to another.

      * **_trading zones_** means zones established to simplify administration of a trade by setting out the known supply source or management arrangements and the physical realities of relevant supply systems within the zone so that trade can occur within and between zones without first having to investigate and establish the details and rules of the system in each zone.

      * **_water access entitlement tagging_** means an accounting approach that allows a water access entitlement that is traded from one jurisdiction or trading zone to another jurisdiction or trading zone to retain its original characteristics when traded to the new jurisdiction or trading zone (rather than being converted into a form issued in the new jurisdiction or trading zone).

##### 2  Objectives and principles

      * This Schedule sets out: 

        * (a) the Basin water market and trading objectives; and

        * (b) the Basin water market and trading principles.

            * Note 1: These objectives and principles are relevant to the formulation of:

              * (a) the provisions of the Basin Plan (see item 12 of the table in subsection 22(1)); and

              * (b) the provisions of water management plans for particular water resource plan areas (see subsection 22(3)); and

              * (c) the provisions of the water market rules (see paragraph 97(1)(b)).

            * Note 2: These objectives and principles are based on those set out in clauses 58 to 63 and Schedule G of the National Water Initiative when Part 2 of this Act commences.

##### 3  Basin water market and trading objectives

      * The objectives of the water market and trading arrangements for the MurrayDarling Basin are: 

        * (a) to facilitate the operation of efficient water markets and the opportunities for trading, within and between Basin States, where water resources are physically shared or hydrologic connections and water supply considerations will permit water trading; and

        * (b) to minimise transaction cost on water trades, including through good information flows in the market and compatible entitlement, registry, regulatory and other arrangements across jurisdictions; and

        * (c) to enable the appropriate mix of water products to develop based on water access entitlements which can be traded either in whole or in part, and either temporarily or permanently, or through lease arrangements or other trading options that may evolve over time; and

        * (d) to recognise and protect the needs of the environment; and

        * (e) to provide appropriate protection of thirdparty interests.

##### 4  Basin water market and trading principles

      * (1) This clause sets out the Basin water market and trading principles.

      * (2) Water access entitlements may be traded either permanently, through lease arrangements, or through other trading options that may evolve over time, if water resources are physically shared or hydrologic connections and water supply considerations would permit water trading.

      * (3) All trades should be recorded on a water register. Registers will be compatible, publicly accessible and reliable, recording information on a whole of catchment basis, consistent with the National Water Initiative.

      * (4) Restrictions on extraction, diversion or use of water resulting from trade can only be used to manage:

        * (a) environmental impacts, including impacts on ecosystems that depend on underground water; or

        * (b) hydrological, water quality and hydrogeological impacts; or

        * (c) delivery constraints; or

        * (d) impacts on geographical features (such as river and aquifer integrity); or

        * (e) features of major indigenous, cultural heritage or spiritual significance.

      * (5) A trade may be refused on the basis that it is inconsistent with the relevant water resource plan.

      * (6) Trades must not result in the longterm annual diversion limit being exceeded. That is, trades must not:

        * (a) cause an increase in commitments to take water from water resources or parts of water resources; or

        * (b) increase seasonal reversals in flow regimes;

      * above sustainable levels identified in relevant water resource plans such that environmental water or water dependent ecosystems are adversely affected.

      * (7) Trades within overallocated water resources (including ground water resources) may be permitted in some cases subject to conditions to manage longterm impacts on the environment and other users.

      * (8) Where necessary, water authorities will facilitate trade by specifying trading zones and providing related information such as the exchange rates to be applied to trades in water allocations to:

        * (a) adjust for the effects of the transfer on hydrology or supply security (transmission losses) or reliability; and

        * (b) reflect transfers between different classes of water resources, unregulated streams, regulated streams, supplemented streams, ground water systems and licensed runoff harvesting dams.

      * (9) Water trading zones, including ground water trading zones, should be defined in terms of:

        * (a) the ability to change the point of extraction of the water from one place to another; and

        * (b) the protection of the environment.

      * The volume of delivery losses in supplemented systems that provide opportunistic environmental flows will be estimated and taken into account when determining the maximum volume of water that may be traded out of a trading zone.

      * (10) Exchange rates must not be used to achieve other outcomes such as to alter the balance between economic use and environmental protection or to reduce overall water use.

      * (11) Trade in water allocations may occur within common aquifers or surface water flow systems consistent with water resource plans.

      * (12) Trade from a licensed runoff harvesting dam (that is, not a small farm dam) to a river may occur subject to:

        * (a) a reduction in dam capacity consistent with the transferred water access entitlement; or

        * (b) retention of sufficient capacity to accommodate evaporative and infiltration losses; or

        * (c) conditions specified in water resource plans to protect the environment.

      * (13) Compatible institutional and regulatory arrangements will be pursued to improve intrastate and interstate trade, and to manage differences in entitlement reliability, supply losses, supply source constraints, trading between systems and cap requirements.

      * (14) The transfer of water allocations and entitlements will be facilitated (where appropriate) by water access entitlement tagging, water access entitlement exchange rates or other trading mechanisms that may evolve over time.

      * (15) Institutional, legislative and administrative arrangements will be introduced to improve the efficiency and scope of water trade and to remove barriers that may affect potential trade.

      * (16) Barriers to permanent trade out of water irrigation areas up to an annual threshold limit of 4% of the total water entitlement of that area will be immediately removed, subject to a review by 2009 by the National Water Commission under paragraph 7(2)(h) of the _National Water Commission Act 2004, _with a move to full and open trade by 2014 at the latest.

      * (17) Subject to this clause, no new barriers to trade will be imposed, including in the form of arrangements for addressing stranded assets.

## Schedule 3A--Risk assignment framework

    * Note: See section 74A.

### Part 1--Clauses 48 to 50 of the National Water Initiative

    * 48.     	_Water access entitlement _holders are to bear the risks of any reduction or less reliable water allocation, under their _water access entitlements_, arising from reductions to the consumptive pool as a result of: 

    *      (i) seasonal or longterm changes in climate; and 
    * (ii)    periodic natural events such as bushfires and drought. 


    * 49.     	The risks of any reduction or less reliable water allocation under a _water access entitlement_, arising as a result of bona fide improvements in the knowledge of water systems' capacity to sustain particular extraction levels are to be borne by users up to 2014. Risks arising under comprehensive _water plans _commencing or renewed after 2014 are to be shared over each ten year period in the following way: 

      * i)     _water access entitlement _holders to bear the first 3% reduction in water allocation under a _water access entitlement; _

      * _ii)    State/Territory governments and the Commonwealth Government to share onethird and twothirds respectively reductions in water allocation under _water access entitlements _of between 3% and 6%; and 

      * iii)   State/Territory and Commonwealth governments to equally share reductions in water allocation under _water access entitlements _greater than 6%_. _

    * _50.     	Governments are to bear the risks of any reduction or less reliable water allocation that is not previously provided for, arising from changes in government policy (for example, new environmental objectives). In such cases, governments may recover this water in accordance with the principles for assessing the most efficient and cost effective measures for water recovery.

### Part 2--Clause 10.1.3 of the Agreement on MurrayDarling Basin Reform of 3 July 2008

    * 10.1.3  	Commonwealth undertakes to use its best endeavours to enact legislation to amend Division 4 of Part 2 of the Water Act so that:

    *  In respect of those Basin States who choose to apply the National Water Initiative risk assignment framework: 

      * a)     the Commonwealth's share of a reduction in a longterm average sustainable diversion limit includes, in any 10 year period, all of the new knowledge components of the reductions that exceed three per cent of the relevant diversion limit; and

      * b)    for a water resource plan area in the MurrayDarling Basin with a transitional or interim water resource plan, the Commonwealth will take responsibility for its share of the new knowledge component of a reduction in the longterm average sustainable diversion limit for the water resources of that plan area arising after the transitional or interim water resource plan ceases to have effect.
