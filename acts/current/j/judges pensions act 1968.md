     * Deferred pension if operative time in growth phase

     * (3) If, at the operative time, a standard pension is not payable in respect of the original interest, then the nonmember spouse is entitled to an associate deferred pension in accordance with section 17AB.

     * Reduction of pensions

     * (2) In working out the annual rate of the retirement pension that is payable:

      * (a) work out the annual rate of the pension under section 6A, 6B or 6C; and

      * (b) reduce that rate by the amount worked out using the formula in subsection (5) of this section.

     * (3) If section 16 applies in relation to the retirement pension, the annual rate worked out under paragraph (2)(a) must take into account a reduction of the amount of the pension under that section.

     * (4) For the purposes of working out the rate of the spouse pension that is payable under section 7, the rate of the relevant pension in relation to the Judge is to be worked out as follows:

      * (a) work out the annual rate of the relevant pension under section 6A, 6B or 6C;

      * (b) reduce that rate by the amount worked out using the formula in subsection (5) of this section.

     * (5) The formula is:

     * where: 

     * **_pension rate_** means the annual rate of the retirement pension or relevant pension worked out under section 6A (disregarding subsection 6A(1)).

        * Note: If the original interest has been split more than once, see section 17AE for a modification of this formula.

     * Accrued pension factor

     * (6) The **_accrued pension factor_** for the Judge is:

      * (a) if at the operative time the Judge was at least 60 and had served as a Judge for at least 10 years--1; or

      * (b) otherwise--the number worked out by dividing the number of days the Judge had served as a Judge at the operative time by the qualifying service days of the Judge.

     * (7) The number worked out under paragraph (6)(b) is to be rounded to 6 decimal places (rounding up if the seventh decimal place is 5 or more).

     * Effect of reduction on other pensions

     * (8) If:

      * (a) the annual rate of a retirement pension of a retired Judge is reduced under subsection (2); and

      * (b) a pension under section 8 later becomes payable because the Judge dies;

     * then, for purposes of section 8, the rate of the pension that would have been payable to the Judge is the rate worked out for the retirement pension under subsection (2) of this section (disregarding subsection (3)).

     * (9) If the rate of a retirement pension or relevant pension is reduced under this section, the reduction is to be disregarded in working out the rate of any nonstandard pension that later becomes payable.

##### 17AE  Reduction of retirement pension etc. if original interest has been split more than once

     * (1) If:

      * (a) section 17AD applies in relation to an original interest; and

      * (b) before the retirement pension or spouse pension referred to in that section becomes payable, the original interest has been split more than once because section 17AA has previously applied;

     * the formula in subsection 17AD(5) is modified as set out in subsection (2) of this section.

     * (2) In applying the formula in subsection 17AD(5), the component (APF  Transfer factor) is to be replaced by the number worked out using the following method statement, based on the chronological order of the operative times (starting with the earliest):

Method statement

       * Step 1.	Work out a factor (the **_interim factor_**) for the first split using the formula:

       * Step 2.	Work out a factor (the **_interim factor_**) for the next split (the **_current split_**), using the formula:

       * Step 3.	Work out a factor for each remaining split (if any), using the formula in step 2.

       * Step 4.	Add together the factors worked out under steps 1 to 3.

        * Example: Assume 2 splits, with the first split having an APF of 0.4 and a transfer factor of 0.5 and the second split having an APF of 0.6 and a transfer factor of 0.5. Applying the above steps, the replacement number for the formula is 0.4, that is:

##### 17AF  Operative time during growth phase--reduction of benefit under section 12A

     * If: 

      * (a) at the operative time, a standard pension is not payable in respect of the original interest; and

      * (b) after the operative time, a benefit under section 12A becomes payable in respect of the original interest because of paragraph 12A(1)(a);

     * the amount of the benefit (the **_benefit amount_**) is reduced, with effect from the operative time, by the amount calculated by multiplying the benefit amount, worked out at that time, by the transfer factor.

##### 17AG  Operative time during growth phase--reduction of associate deferred pension

     * If: 

      * (a) at the operative time, a standard pension is not payable in respect of the original interest; and

      * (b) the original interest is an entitlement to an associate deferred pension;

     * the annual rate of the associate deferred pension (when it becomes payable) is reduced to the amount calculated under the Pension Orders.

        * Note: Although an associate immediate pension becomes payable at the operative time, an associate deferred pension will often not become payable until some time after the operative time.

##### 17AH  Operative time during payment phase--reduction of standard pension

     * (1) This section applies if, at the operative time, a standard pension is payable in respect of the original interest.

     * (2) If the standard pension is not a retirement pension, the rate of the pension is reduced to the amount calculated under the Pension Orders.

     * (3) If the standard pension is a retirement pension, the annual rate of the pension is worked out as follows:

      * (a) work out the annual rate of the pension under section 6A, 6B or 6C;

      * (b) reduce that rate to the amount calculated under the Pension Orders.

     * (4) If section 16 applies in relation to the retirement pension, the annual rate worked out under paragraph (3)(a) must take into account a reduction of the pension under that section.

     * Effect of reduction on other pensions

      * (a) the annual rate of a retirement pension of a retired Judge is reduced under subsection (3); and

      * (b) a pension under section 8 later becomes payable because the Judge dies;

     * then, for purposes of section 8, the rate of the pension that would have been payable to the Judge is the rate worked out for the retirement pension under subsection (3) of this section (disregarding subsection (4)).
