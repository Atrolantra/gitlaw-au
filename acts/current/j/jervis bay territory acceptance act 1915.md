      * (2) Subsection (1) extends to:

       * (a) sections 6 and 7 of the _Seat of Government Acceptance Act 1909_; and

       * (b) the whole of the _Seat of Government (Administration) Act 1910 _except sections 9 and 12 of that Act;

but does not extend to any other Act or provision of an Act.

##### 4AA  Criminal Code does not apply

      * Chapter 2 of the _Criminal Code_ does not apply in relation to, or in relation to matters arising under, a law in force in the Territory because of section 4A.

      * (2) The GovernorGeneral may direct that a power or function vested in a person or authority (not being a court) by a law of the Australian Capital Territory in force in the Territory because of section 4A shall, in relation to the Territory, be vested in, and may be exercised or performed by, such other person or authority as the GovernorGeneral specifies.
