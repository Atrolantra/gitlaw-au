# Biosecurity Act 2015

#### No. 61, 2015

### An Act relating to diseases and pests that may cause harm to human, animal or plant health or the environment, and for related purposes

##### [Assented to 16 June 2015]

### The Parliament of Australia enacts: 

## Chapter 1--Preliminary

### Part 1--Preliminary

##### 1  Short title

    * This Act may be cited as the _Biosecurity Act 2015._

##### _2  Commencement

    * (1) Each provision of this Act specified in column 1 of the table commences, or is taken to have commenced, in accordance with column 2 of the table. Any other statement in column 2 has effect according to its terms.

        *  	Note: This table relates only to the provisions of this Act as originally enacted. It will not be amended to deal with any later amendments of this Act.

    * (2) Any information in column 3 of the table is not part of this Act. Information may be inserted in this column, or information in it may be edited, in any published version of this Act.

##### 3  Simplified outline of this Act

    * This Act is about managing diseases and pests that may cause harm to human, animal or plant health or the environment.

    * This Chapter includes preliminary provisions (such as the extension of this Act to external Territories, and the relationship of this Act with other Australian laws). It also includes the definitions for this Act, provisions that relate to the Constitution and international law, and principles affecting decisions to exercise certain powers under this Act.

    * Chapter 2 deals with managing risks to human health. That Chapter only deals with diseases (listed human diseases) that are listed in a legislative instrument. The main method of managing risks to human health is by imposing a human biosecurity control order on an individual who may have a listed human disease. However, Chapter 2 also includes requirements in relation to persons entering or leaving Australian territory, and rules relating to managing deceased individuals.

    * Chapter 3 deals with managing biosecurity risks in relation to goods that are brought into Australian territory from outside Australian territory. These goods become subject to biosecurity control when the aircraft or vessel carrying the goods enters Australian territory. Powers may be exercised to assess the level of biosecurity risk associated with the goods, and biosecurity measures may be required to reduce that risk if it is considered to be unacceptable. Chapter 3 also provides a mechanism for prohibiting certain goods from being brought or imported into Australian territory, either absolutely or subject to conditions, and includes provisions dealing with biosecurity import risk analyses and import permits.

    * Chapter 4 deals with managing biosecurity risks in relation to aircraft and vessels that enter Australian territory from outside Australian territory, including by controlling the places where they can land or be moored and their movement while they are in Australian territory. These conveyances become subject to biosecurity control when they enter Australian territory. Powers may be exercised to assess the level of biosecurity risk associated with them, and biosecurity measures may be required to reduce that risk if it is considered to be unacceptable. Chapter 4 also provides for a scheme to deal with ship sanitation for the purposes of the International Health Regulations.

    * Chapter 5 deals with the ballast water and sediment of certain vessels. It requires reporting of intended or actual discharges of ballast water in Australian seas. Discharging ballast water in Australian seas is an offence, subject to a range of exceptions, and there is an offence of disposing of sediment. The Chapter also includes provisions for ballast water management plans and certificates, recordkeeping obligations and powers to ensure compliance.

    * Chapter 6 deals with managing biosecurity risks (other than those covered by Chapter 3 or 4) posed by diseases or pests that may be in or on goods or premises in Australian territory. The Chapter provides for powers to be exercised to monitor, respond to and control those risks.

    * Chapter 7 provides for arrangements to be approved authorising and requiring biosecurity industry participants to carry out biosecurity activities to manage biosecurity risks associated with goods, premises or other things for the purposes of this Act.

    * Chapter 8 provides for the GovernorGeneral to declare biosecurity emergencies and human biosecurity emergencies. Part 1 gives the Agriculture Minister special powers to deal with biosecurity emergencies and provides for certain powers to be delegated to national response agencies. Part 1 also includes other modifications of the Act that apply during biosecurity emergencies. Part 2 gives the Health Minister special powers to deal with human biosecurity emergencies, including by giving effect to recommendations of the World Health Organization.

    * Chapter 9 gives officers powers to ensure people are complying with this Act, to investigate noncompliance and to enforce this Act by means such as civil penalties, infringement notices, enforceable undertakings and injunctions. In many cases this is done by applying the Regulatory Powers Act. The Chapter also provides for warrants for officers to enter premises and exercise powers for some other purposes relating to biosecurity, as well as powers for officers to enter premises and exercise powers there without a warrant or consent in some limited cases. Officers have certain obligations relating to their entry to premises (with or without a warrant or consent), and occupiers of premises have certain rights relating to the activities of officers on their premises. The Chapter also includes other provisions relevant to ensuring compliance with this Act, such as how to determine whether a person is a fit and proper person.

    * Chapter 10 deals with matters relating to governance and officials. It includes provisions relating to the functions and powers of the Director of Biosecurity, the Director of Human Biosecurity, biosecurity officers, biosecurity enforcement officers, chief human biosecurity officers and human biosecurity officers.

    * Chapter 11 includes miscellaneous provisions, dealing with matters such as:

      * (a) review of reviewable decisions under this Act; and

      * (b) the confidentiality of information obtained under this Act; and

      * (c) recovering costs under this Act; and

      * (d) abandoned or forfeited goods and conveyances; and

      * (e) modification of this Act in relation to certain movements of persons, goods and conveyances.

##### 4  Objects of this Act

    * The objects of this Act are the following: 

     * (a) to provide for managing the following:

      * (i) biosecurity risks;

      * (ii) the risk of contagion of a listed human disease;

      * (iii) the risk of listed human diseases entering Australian territory or a part of Australian territory, or emerging, establishing themselves or spreading in Australian territory or a part of Australian territory;

      * (iv) risks related to ballast water;

      * (v) biosecurity emergencies and human biosecurity emergencies;

     * (b) to give effect to Australia's international rights and obligations, including under the International Health Regulations, the SPS Agreement and the Biodiversity Convention.

        * Note: The expression biosecurity risk referred to in subparagraph (a)(i) has different meanings depending on whether it is for the purposes of Chapter 6 (managing biosecurity risks: monitoring, control and response) or another part of this Act (see sections 9 and 310).

##### 5  Appropriate Level of Protection (ALOP) for Australia against biosecurity risks

    * The **_Appropriate Level of Protection_** (or **_ALOP_**) for Australia is a high level of sanitary and phytosanitary protection aimed at reducing biosecurity risks to a very low level, but not to zero.

        * Note 1: This section is in accordance with Australia's rights and obligations under the SPS Agreement.

        * Note 2: The ALOP for Australia must be applied in conducting a BIRA (see subsection 167(2)) or a risk assessment for the purpose of deciding whether particular goods, or a particular class of goods, can be brought or imported into Australian territory (see subsections 173(4), 174(3), 179(3) and 182(4)).

##### 6  Act binds the Crown

    * (1) This Act binds the Crown in each of its capacities.

    * (2) This Act does not make the Crown liable to be:

     * (a) prosecuted for an offence; or

     * (b) subject to civil proceedings for a civil penalty order under Part 4 of the Regulatory Powers Act; or

     * (c) given an infringement notice under Part 5 of the Regulatory Powers Act.

##### 7  Extension of Act to Christmas Island, Cocos (Keeling) Islands and other prescribed external Territories

    * (1) This Act extends to Christmas Island and the Cocos (Keeling) Islands.

    * (2) The regulations may extend this Act or any provisions of this Act, other than Chapter 5 (ballast water), to any other external Territory that is prescribed by the regulations.

        * Note: Chapter 5 extends to all the external Territories (see section 259).

##### 8  Concurrent operation of State and Territory laws

    * (1) This Act does not exclude or limit the operation of a law of a State or Territory that is capable of operating concurrently with this Act (except as referred to in subsection (2)).

    * (2) Subsection (1) is subject to the following provisions:

     * (a) section 172 (prohibited goods);

     * (b) section 265 (ballast water);

     * (c) subsections 445(4), 446(4), 477(5) and 478(4) (biosecurity emergencies and human biosecurity emergencies).

    * (3) Without limiting subsection (1), this Act does not exclude or limit the concurrent operation of a law of a State or Territory to the extent that:

     * (a) the law makes an act or omission:

      * (i) an offence; or

      * (ii) subject to a civil penalty; and

     * (b) that (or any similar) act or omission is also:

      * (i) an offence against a provision of this Act; or

      * (ii) subject to a civil penalty under this Act.

    * (4) Subsection (3) applies even if the law of the State or Territory does any one or more of the following, in relation to the offence or civil penalty:

     * (a) provides for a penalty that differs from the penalty provided for in this Act;

     * (b) provides for fault elements that differ from the fault elements applicable to the offence or civil penalty provision created by this Act;

     * (c) provides for defences or exceptions that differ from the defences or exceptions applicable to the offence or civil penalty provision created by this Act.

    * (3) Goods to which this Division applies are **_exposed goods_**.

        * Note: See section 17 for the meaning of **_exposed to_**.

##### 159  Assessment and management of biosecurity risk associated with exposed goods

    * (1) A biosecurity officer may, subject to subsection (4), exercise the powers in Division 4 (biosecurity risk assessment powers) for the purpose of identifying and assessing the level of biosecurity risk associated with exposed goods.

    * (2) For the purposes of subsection (1), the powers in Division 4 may be exercised in relation to exposed goods as if they were subject to biosecurity control.

    * (3) If a biosecurity officer suspects, on reasonable grounds, that the level of biosecurity risk associated with exposed goods is unacceptable, a biosecurity officer may, subject to subsection (4), make an exposed goods order in relation to the goods.

    * (4) A biosecurity officer must not exercise the powers in Division 4 (as applied by subsections (1) and (2)), or make an exposed goods order, in relation to exposed goods unless the goods:

     * (a) are within the precincts of a landing place or port; or

     * (b) are on board a conveyance that is subject to biosecurity control; or

     * (c) are on premises owned or controlled by the Commonwealth where biosecurity measures can be taken for the purpose of managing biosecurity risks; or

     * (d) are on premises where biosecurity activities are carried out by a biosecurity industry participant in accordance with an approved arrangement covering the biosecurity industry participant.

##### 160  Exposed goods orders

    * (1) An exposed goods order must:

     * (a) be in writing; and

     * (b) specify the exposed goods to which the order relates; and

     * (c) specify the period during which the order is to be in force.

    * (2) An exposed goods order is not a legislative instrument.

    * (3) A biosecurity officer must give a copy of an exposed goods order to a person in charge of the exposed goods to which the order relates, if it is practicable to do so.

##### 161  Effect of exposed goods order

    * (1) If an exposed goods order is in force in relation to exposed goods, the following provisions (to the extent that they are applicable) apply in relation to the goods as if they were subject to biosecurity control:

     * (a) Division 4 (biosecurity risk assessment powers);

     * (b) Division 5 (biosecurity measures to manage unacceptable level of biosecurity risk);

     * (c) Divisions 6 and 7 (unloading goods);

     * (d) Division 8 (reporting biosecurity incidents);

     * (e) Division 10 (release of goods from biosecurity control).

    * (2) An exposed goods order ceases to be in force in relation to exposed goods if any of the following occurs:

     * (a) the order expires;

     * (b) the order is revoked;

     * (c) subject to subsection (3), the goods are released from biosecurity control under Division 10.

    * (3) If:

     * (a) goods to which an exposed goods order is in force are released from biosecurity control under paragraph 162(1)(e) by leaving Australian territory on a conveyance that is on a journey between places in Australian territory; and

     * (b) the exposed goods order has not expired and has not been revoked when the conveyance reenters Australian territory during that journey;

    * the exposed goods order takes effect again when the conveyance reenters Australian territory during that journey.

        * Note: Goods are released from biosecurity control under paragraph 162(1)(e) if they leave Australian territory.

#### Division 10--Release of goods from biosecurity control

##### 162  When goods brought into Australian territory are released from biosecurity control

    * (1) Goods that are subject to biosecurity control are released from biosecurity control if:

     * (a) a biosecurity officer notifies or, before the goods became subject to biosecurity control, notified a person in charge of the goods, under section 163, that the goods are released from biosecurity control; or

     * (b) a biosecurity industry participant, who is authorised to release the goods in accordance with an approved arrangement covering the participant, gives or, before the goods became subject to biosecurity control, gave a person in charge of the goods a written notice releasing them from biosecurity control; or

     * (c) the goods are prescribed goods and the goods leave a designated biosecurity control release area at a first point of entry or an international mail centre; or

     * (d) the goods are destroyed; or

     * (e) the goods leave Australian territory.

        * Note 1: This Division also applies in relation to exposed goods in relation to which an exposed goods order is in force. This section applies to those goods as if they were subject to biosecurity control (see subsection 161(1)).

        * Note 2: If goods are released from biosecurity control under paragraph (1)(e) by leaving Australian territory on a conveyance that is on a journey between places in Australian territory, the goods become subject to biosecurity control again when the conveyance reenters Australian territory during that journey (see subsection 119(4)). See also subsection 161(3), which deals with exposed goods in relation to which an exposed goods order is in force.

        * Note 3: A biosecurity officer may refuse to release goods from biosecurity control if the goods are withheld under section 600 because a costrecovery charge has not been paid (see subsection 600(4)).

    * (2) To avoid doubt, if goods are released from biosecurity control under paragraph (1)(a) or (b) because of a notification, or written notice given, before the goods became subject to biosecurity control, they are released immediately after they became subject to biosecurity control.

        * Note: The goods are therefore subject to biosecurity control for an instant. If a costrecovery charge is due and payable by the owner of the goods at that instant, section 598 creates a charge on the goods.

    * (3) Neither of the following is a legislative instrument:

     * (a) a notification that is given in writing under paragraph (1)(a);

     * (b) a notice referred to in paragraph (1)(b).

    * (4) The regulations may provide that a specified area at a first point of entry or an international mail centre is a designated biosecurity control release area for the purposes of paragraph (1)(c).

##### 163  Notice releasing goods from biosecurity control

    * Giving notice

    * (1) For the purposes of paragraph 162(1)(a), a notice releasing goods from biosecurity control may be given:

     * (a) in writing (including by an automated electronic system); or

     * (b) orally.

    * Automated release notices

    * (2) An automated electronic system that is used to produce notices (**_automated release notices_**) releasing goods from biosecurity control for the purposes of paragraph 162(1)(a) must comply with the requirements prescribed by the regulations.

    * (3) An automated release notice is taken to have been given by a biosecurity officer.

    * (4) An automated release notice in relation to goods is of no effect to the extent that it is inconsistent with an earlier direction given in relation to the goods by a biosecurity officer under this Act.

##### 164  Revoking notice releasing goods from biosecurity control

    * Revoking notice given by biosecurity officer

    * (1) A biosecurity officer may revoke a notice releasing goods from biosecurity control for the purposes of paragraph 162(1)(a) that was given to a person, by informing the person in writing or orally of the revocation. It does not matter whether the notice was given in writing (including by an automated electronic system) or orally.

    * Revoking notice given by biosecurity industry participant

    * (2) If a biosecurity industry participant gave a person in charge of goods a written notice for the purposes of paragraph 162(1)(b) releasing them from biosecurity control, the biosecurity industry participant or a biosecurity officer may revoke the notice by informing the person in writing of the revocation.

    * Grounds for revocation and timing of revocation

    * (3) Despite subsections (1) and (2), the biosecurity officer or biosecurity industry participant may revoke the notice only if:

     * (a) he or she suspects on reasonable grounds that the level of biosecurity risk associated with the goods is unacceptable; and

     * (b) the revocation occurs before any of the conditions in paragraphs 162(1)(c), (d) and (e) exist in relation to the goods.

    * Effect of revocation

    * (4) The revoked notice is taken never to have been given. This has effect for the purposes of this Act, except this section.

    * Written information of revocation is not a legislative instrument

    * (5) If the information of the revocation is in writing, the writing is not a legislative instrument.

### Part 6--Biosecurity monitoring zones

#### Division 1--Introduction

##### 377  Simplified outline of this Part

    * This Part provides for certain areas in Australian territory to be biosecurity monitoring zones. Powers may be exercised in these zones for the purpose of monitoring whether a disease or pest that may pose an unacceptable level of biosecurity risk:

      * (a) has entered, or has emerged, established itself or spread in, the zone; or

      * (b) is likely to enter, or to emerge, establish itself or spread in, the zone.

    * There are 2 kinds of biosecurity monitoring zones--permanent biosecurity monitoring zones (see Division 2) and temporary biosecurity monitoring zones (see Division 3).

    * Permanent biosecurity monitoring zones are areas in Australian territory that are within the permissible distance of other areas that are considered to have a high level of biosecurity risk associated with them, for example first points of entry for goods being brought into Australian territory or for aircraft or vessels entering Australian territory.

    * Division 2 deals with the powers that may be exercised (including in premises) in a permanent biosecurity monitoring zone, and sets out the civil penalty provisions.

    * Under Division 3, the Director of Biosecurity may determine that a specified area in Australian territory is a temporary biosecurity monitoring zone if the Director is satisfied it is necessary to do so for the purpose of monitoring whether a disease or pest that may pose an unacceptable level of biosecurity risk:

      * (a) has entered, or has emerged, established itself or spread in, the area; or

      * (b) is likely to enter, or to emerge, establish itself or spread in, the area.

    * Division 3 sets out requirements relating to making a temporary biosecurity monitoring zone determination, including requirements relating to the content of the determination and requirements relating to consultation and notification.

    * Division 3 also deals with the powers that may be exercised (including in premises) in accordance with a temporary biosecurity monitoring zone determination and sets out civil penalty provisions.

    * Before exercising a power in a permanent biosecurity monitoring zone or in accordance with a temporary biosecurity monitoring zone determination, a biosecurity official must be satisfied of the matters referred to in section 32 (the principles).

##### 621  Release from biosecurity control if goods leave destination part

    * (1) This section applies if goods:

     * (a) become subject to biosecurity control because of the application (the **_basic application_**) of the affected provisions as described in section 620 in relation to a movement (the **_basic movement_**) of the goods from the origin part to the destination part; and

     * (b) the goods leave the destination part.

    * (2) When the goods leave the destination part, they are taken to be released under section 162 from the biosecurity control to which they were subject because of the basic application.

        * Example: If the goods were subject to biosecurity control while in the destination part for reasons other than the basic application (such as having entered Australian territory from a foreign country when they entered the origin part), subsection (2) does not treat them as being released from that control when they leave the destination part.

##### 622  Release from biosecurity control if aircraft or vessel leaves destination part

    * (1) This section applies if an aircraft or vessel:

     * (a) becomes subject to biosecurity control because of the application (the **_basic application_**) of the affected provisions as described in section 620 in relation to a movement (the **_basic movement_**) of the aircraft or vessel from the origin part to the destination part; and

    * (2) When the aircraft or vessel leaves the destination part, the aircraft or vessel is taken to be released under section 218 from the biosecurity control to which it was subject because of the basic application.

    * (3) If, when the aircraft or vessel leaves the destination part, it also leaves Australian territory as described in subsection 191(4), the aircraft or vessel does not become subject to biosecurity control again because of that subsection and the fact that the aircraft or vessel was subject to biosecurity control because of the basic application.

    * (4) To avoid doubt, subsection (2) does not affect the status of the aircraft or vessel being or becoming subject to biosecurity control for reasons other than the basic application.

        * Example 1: If the aircraft was subject to biosecurity control while in the destination part for reasons other than the basic application (such as having entered Australian territory from a foreign country when the aircraft entered the origin part), subsection (2) does not treat the aircraft as being released from that control when the aircraft leaves the destination part.

        * Example 2: Subsection (2) does not prevent the vessel from becoming subject to biosecurity control because of an application, other than the basic application, of the affected provisions as described in section 620 in relation to the movement (the **_leaving movement_**) involving leaving the destination part for the basic movement if:

         * (a) the destination part for the basic movement is the origin part for the leaving movement; and

         * (b) the leaving movement involves moving directly from the origin part for the leaving movement into the destination part for the leaving movement (whether or not the destination part for the leaving movement is the origin part for the basic movement).

##### 623  How the exit provisions apply because of this Subdivision

    * The exit provisions apply in relation to the actual or intended movement (however described) of persons, aircraft and vessels from the origin part to the destination part as if:

     * (a) only the origin part were Australian territory; and

    * (2) To avoid doubt, a reference in this Act outside this Subdivision to any of the affected provisions (however the provision is referred to) includes a reference to the provision as it applies because of this Subdivision.

        * Example: One of the affected provisions may be referred to by its Part or section number.

    * (3) This Subdivision and section 616, to the extent that it relates to modification of a provision of this Act, do not limit each other.
