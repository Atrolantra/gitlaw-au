## Schedule 1--Control and ownership of company interests

### Part 1--Introduction

##### 1  Control--general

    * (1) This Schedule is intended to provide a means of finding out who is in a position to exercise control of commercial television broadcasting licences, commercial radio broadcasting licences, subscription television broadcasting licences, international broadcasting licences, datacasting transmitter licences, restricted datacasting licences, newspapers and companies and a means of tracing company interests.

    * This Schedule recognises that the concept of control of a licence, a newspaper or a company can be a complex one.

    * The holding of company interests is not the only way to be in a position to exercise control. Clauses 2 and 3 set out the rules for deciding when a position to exercise control exists. While company interests may be important in deciding that question, they are only one issue. In some cases, it may be important to look at agreements and arrangements between people and at accustomed courses of conduct between people. In this respect, the definition of **_associate_** in section 6 of this Act is important.

    * A person who has company interests exceeding 15% in a company is regarded as being in a position to control the company.

    * Control of a company may also come about through company interests of 15% or less. This could happen where a person holds company interests of say 10% but no other person holds company interests of more than say 2% and those other persons do not act in concert.

    * A person may be in a position to exercise control of only the media activities of a licensee or a newspaper, but that position is nevertheless to be regarded as a position to exercise control of the licence or the newspaper.

    * (2) Because of the complexities involved in this area, it is not possible to provide rules which will give a definite answer in all cases. Therefore, the ACMA is given a monitoring role over the broadcasting and datacasting industries and suitable powers of investigation in order to reach a conclusion as to whether a person is in a position to exercise control or not. In order to provide certainty for persons involved in those industries, the ACMA is also given, under section 74, a power to give a binding opinion on the question of control.

### Part 3--Deemed control

##### 5  Explanation of examples

    * In an example in this Part, a percentage written next to an arrow indicates that the person before the arrow has company interests in the company to which the arrow is pointing which exceeds that percentage. 

##### 6  The 15% rule

    * (1) If a person has company interests in a company exceeding 15%, the person is to be regarded as being in a position to exercise control of the company.

##### 7  Application of method through chain of companies

    * The method described in clause 6 can be applied in the case of a chain of companies. Where a company interest of more than 15% is maintained throughout the chain, the person is to be regarded as being in a position to exercise control of the last company in the chain.

    * **_Example:_**

    * _**_		Here the _person_ is to be regarded as being in a position to exercise control of Company D._

### _Part 4--Tracing of ownership

##### 8  Tracing of ownership

    * Company interests can be traced through a chain of companies using a method known as the fractional tracing method. This method applies a formula to decide what company interest a person has.

    * This method is best demonstrated by an example.

    * **_Example:_**

    * _**_		The per_s_on's company interest in Company B is worked out using the formula:_

    * where: _

    * _**_Company Interest 1_**_ is the company interest of the person, expressed as a fraction, in Company A._

    * _**_Company Interest 2 _**_is the company interest of Company A, expressed as a fraction, in Company B._

    * In this case, the formula produces: 3/10 X 1/10, which means that the person has a 3% company interest in Company B._

    * _Interests traced in this way can be added. If Company B is a licensee and the person had, through other chains of companies, a further 12.5% company interest in Company B, the person would be regarded as being in a position to exercise control of Company B under Part 3 of this Schedule because the person would have company interests exceeding 15% in Company B.

    * **_Example:_**

    * _**		In this example, the person has a 15.5% company interest in Company B. This is made up of 3% (through Company A), 8% (through Company C) and 4.5% (through Company D).

    * This method of tracing ownership may be used through any number of companies. However, the ACMA is not required to trace every minor company interest.
