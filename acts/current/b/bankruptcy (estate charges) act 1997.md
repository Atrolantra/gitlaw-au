    * (1) An amount of interest to which a person is entitled, in his or her personal capacity, under subsection 169(1B) or 185LD(3) of the _Bankruptcy Act 1966_ is payable to the Commonwealth as a charge.

    * (1A) No charge is payable by a person in respect of an account for a charge period if the amount of that charge would be less than $10, or a higher amount prescribed by the regulations.

    * (2) In subsection (1), the reference to subsection 169(1B) of the _Bankruptcy Act 1966_ includes a reference to that subsection as applied by the following provisions of that Act:

     * (a) section 210 (which applies section 169 to a controlling trustee under Division 2 of Part X of that Act);

     * (b) subsection 231(5) (which applies section 169 to a personal insolvency agreement);

     * (e) subsection 248(1) (which applies section 169 to administration of estates under Part XI of that Act).

    * (3) The charge is payable by the person.

    * (4) The charge is payable within 35 days after the end of the charge period in which the interest was paid.

### Part 3--Realisations charge

##### 6  Realisations charge

    * (1) A charge, calculated in accordance with sections 7 and 8, is imposed in respect of amounts received by a person (including the Official Trustee) who, during a charge period:

    * (1A) No charge is payable by a person for a charge period in respect of a particular estate, personal insolvency agreement, composition or debtor (as the case requires) if the amount of that charge would be less than $10, or a higher amount prescribed by the regulations.

    * (1B) Charge is not payable by a person in the person's capacity as administrator of a debt agreement under Part IX of the _Bankruptcy Act 1966_ if the person is the debtor to whom the debt agreement relates.

    * (3) The charge is payable within 35 days after the end of the charge period.

##### 6A  Charge not payable on estate surplus

    * (1) If:

     * (a) the person receives an amount in respect of a bankrupt's estate; and

     * (b) as a result of receiving the amount, the person becomes able to pay off all the bankrupt's debts;

    * then the following amounts are not taken into account in determining the amount on which charge is payable: 

     * (c) any excess of the received amount over the amount needed to pay off all the bankrupt's debts;

     * (d) any amount later received by the person in respect of the estate.

    * (2) In this section:

    * **_bankrupt's debts_** has the same meaning as in subsection 153A(6) of the _Bankruptcy Act 1966_.

##### 7  Amount of charge payable

    * (1) The amount of charge payable for a charge period is the percentage, determined by the Minister by legislative instrument, of the amount on which charge is payable for the period.

    * (2) The Minister may make a legislative instrument determining the percentage.

    * (3) The percentage determined must not be more than 15%.

##### 7A  Certain amounts treated as being received by person

    * For the purposes of this Part, an amount is treated as received by the person if it is applied or dealt with on behalf of the person, or in accordance with the person's directions.

##### 8  Working out the amount on which charge is payable

    * (1) The **_amount on which charge is payable_** for a charge period is the amount realised less the permitted deductions.

    * (2) The **_amount realised_** is the total amount received by the person in the capacity referred to in subsection 6(1) during the charge period, but not including:

     * (a) amounts paid to the person by creditors under an indemnity in respect of costs; or

     * (b) amounts paid to the person under section 305 of the _Bankruptcy Act 1966_.

    * (3) The **_permitted deductions_** are all amounts paid by the person in the capacity referred to in subsection 6(1) during the charge period that are:

     * (a) amounts paid by the person in carrying on the business of the bankrupt, deceased person or debtor; or

     * (b) amounts paid to secured creditors.

    * (4) Once an amount has been taken into account for the purposes of subsection (2) as an amount received, the whole or part of the amount is not to be taken into account again as an amount received for the purposes of another application of that subsection.

### Part 4--Miscellaneous
