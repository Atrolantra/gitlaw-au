      * (f) any other unincorporated association or body of persons;

       * Note: The term **_entity_** is used in a number of different but related senses. It covers all kinds of legal persons. It also covers groups of legal persons, and other things, that in practice are treated as having a separate identity in the same way as a legal person does.

    * (2) Paragraph (1)(f) does not include a non-entity joint venture.

    * (5) If a provision refers to an **_entity_** of a particular kind, it refers to the entity in its capacity as that kind of entity, not to that entity in any other capacity.

       * Example: A provision that refers to a company does not cover a company in a capacity as trustee, unless it also refers to a trustee.

##### 6  Notified State/Territory registers

    * (2) Schedule 1 to this Act has effect subject to any modifications made by the regulations to reflect changes in the registers, or kinds of registers, maintained by the States and Territories.

    * (3) If a Minister of a referring/adopting State or of an affected Territory notifies the Commonwealth Minister in writing of a proposed modification to Schedule 1, the Commonwealth Minister must consult with all other referring/adopting States and affected Territories about the proposed modification.

    * (4) In this section:

##### 13  When business names legislation does not apply

    * (1) Subsection (2) applies if a provision of a law of a referring/adopting State or an affected Territory declares a matter to be an excluded matter for the purposes of this section in relation to:

      * (b) a specified provision of the business names legislation; or

    * (3) Subsection (2) does not apply to the declaration to the extent to which the regulations provide that that subsection does not apply to that declaration.

##### 14  Avoiding direct inconsistency between Commonwealth and State and Territory laws

    * _This section overrides other business names legislation_

    * _	(1)	This section has effect despite anything else in the business names legislation.

    * _When this section does not apply to a referring/adopting State or Territory law_

    * _	(2)	This section does not apply to a provision of a law of a referring/adopting State or an affected Territory that is capable of concurrent operation with the business names legislation.

       * Note: This kind of provision is dealt with by section 12.

    * _When this section applies to a referring/adopting State or Territory law_

    * _	(3)	This section applies to the interaction between a provision (the **_displacement provision_**) of a law of a referring/adopting State or an affected Territory and a provision (the **_Commonwealth provision_**) of the business names legislation only if the displacement provision is declared by a law of the State or Territory to be a business names legislation displacement provision for the purposes of this section (either generally or specifically in relation to the Commonwealth provision).

    * _Effect of displacement provision_

    * _	(4)	The Commonwealth provision does not:

      * (a) prohibit the doing of an act; or

      * (b) impose a liability (whether civil or criminal) for doing an act;

    * if the displacement provision specifically permits, authorises or requires the doing of that act.

    * (5) The Commonwealth provision does not operate in or in relation to the State or Territory to the extent necessary to ensure that no inconsistency arises between:

      * (a) the Commonwealth provision; and

      * (b) the displacement provision to the extent to which the displacement provision would, apart from this subsection, be inconsistent with the Commonwealth provision.

       * Note 1: The displacement provision is not covered by this subsection if subsection (4) applies to the displacement provision: if that subsection applies there would be no potential inconsistency to be dealt with by this subsection.

       * Note 2: The operation of the displacement provision will be supported by section 12 to the extent to which it can operate concurrently with the Commonwealth provision.

    * (6) Subsections (4) and (5) do not apply in relation to the displacement provision to the extent to which the regulations provide that those subsections do not apply in relation to the displacement provision.

       * (iii) circumstances specified in the regulations; or

       * (iv) a person or body specified in the regulations in the circumstances specified in the regulations; or

      * (c) does not require a person to do an act to the extent to which the requirement would otherwise give rise to an inconsistency with a law of a referring/adopting State or an affected Territory; or

      * (d) does not authorise a person to do an act to the extent to which the conferral of that authority on the person would otherwise give rise to an inconsistency with a law of a referring/adopting State or an affected Territory; or

      * (e) does not impose an obligation on a person to the extent to which complying with that obligation would require the person not to comply with an obligation imposed on the person under a law of a referring/adopting State or an affected Territory; or

      * (f) authorises a person to do something for the purposes of the business names legislation that the person:

       * (i) is authorised to do under a law of a referring/adopting State or an affected Territory; and

    * (1) The objects of this Act are:

      * (a) to ensure that if an entity carries on a business under a business name, those who engage or propose to engage with that business can identify the entity and how the entity may be contacted; and

      * (b) to remove the inconvenience caused by the registration of business names under the law of more than one jurisdiction within Australia.

    * (2) These objects are achieved by requiring an entity that intends to carry on a business under a business name to register the business name on a nationally established and maintained register of business names.

    * (3) The objects of this Act are also:

      * (a) to avoid confusion by ensuring that business names that are identical or nearly identical are not registered; and

      * (c) to ensure that business names that should be restricted for any other reason (for example, because they might mislead consumers) are not registered.

    * (4) The objects mentioned in subsection (3) are achieved by rules dealing with the availability of business names.

##### 17  Consequences of registration of a business name

    * (1) The registration of a business name does not affect the rights of any entity in relation to the business name, or a word or an expression that constitutes or is included in the business name, under the law of the Commonwealth or of a State or Territory, or under the general law.

    * (2) An entity does not acquire property in a business name, or in a word or an expression that constitutes or is included in a business name, because the name is registered to the entity under this Act or the Transitional Act.
