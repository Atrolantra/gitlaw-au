##### 5  Registration

   * Despite anything in the Fair Work (Registered Organisations) Act, a non-registered association is not entitled to apply to be registered under that Act, and is not entitled to be registered under that Act, unless:

    * (a) FWA, on application by the non-registered association, has declared that it is satisfied that:

     * (i) if the non-registered association were registered under that Act, the non-registered association would not engage in conduct inimical to the prevention and settlement of industrial disputes by means of conciliation and arbitration; and

     * (ii) the registration of the non-registered association under that Act would not prevent or seriously hinder the achievement of:

      * (B) Parliament's intention in enacting the Fair Work (Registered Organisations) Act; and

    * (b) the requirements of the Fair Work (Registered Organisations) Act, and of the regulations in force under that Act, that would, apart from this section, apply in relation to an application by the non-registered association for registration under that Act have been complied with. 

##### 6  Powers and procedure of FWA

   * (1) The powers of FWA under or by virtue of this Act are exercisable by a Full Bench of FWA. 

     * Note: A Full Bench of FWA is constituted under section 618 of the Fair Work Act. 

   * (2) The provisions of the Fair Work Act, and of the regulations in force under that Act, with respect to the procedure and powers of FWA in relation to proceedings before it under that Act apply, so far as they are capable of application, in relation to proceedings before FWA under or by virtue of this Act. 

   * (3) On an application under paragraph 5(a), the Minister and the non-registered association may be represented by counsel or solicitor.

##### 7  Eligibility of certain building industry employees for membership of certain organizations

   * (1) A reference in this section to a relevant industry is a reference to an industry in or in connection with which The Australian Building Construction Employees' and Builders Labourers' Federation was, immediately before the commencement of the _Builders Labourers' Federation (Cancellation of Registration) Act 1986_, registered under the Conciliation and Arbitration Act.

   * (2) Where the Secretary or another executive officer of an association of employees that is an organisation within the meaning of the Fair Work (Registered Organisations) Act has consented in writing to persons who are, or are usually, employed in work of a specified kind or class, in Australia or in a specified part or parts of Australia, in a relevant industry being made eligible for membership of that organization, the regulations may declare those persons to be eligible for membership of that organization, and, where the regulations so declare, those regulations have effect according to their tenor notwithstanding anything in the rules of that organization as in force at the time when the regulations came into operation.

   * (3) The making of regulations for the purposes of this section declaring persons referred to in the regulations to be eligible for membership of an association of employees that is an organisation within the meaning of the Fair Work (Registered Organisations) Act does not preclude the making of any alteration to the rules of that organization and, if an alteration so made which has been consented to under section 36 of that Act is inconsistent with the terms of the regulations, the regulations, to the extent of the inconsistency, cease to have effect.

   * (4) Regulations made for the purposes of this section continue in force notwithstanding that a non-registered association becomes registered under the Fair Work (Registered Organisations) Act.

##### 8  Regulations

   * The Governor-General may make regulations, not inconsistent with this Act, prescribing matters:

    * (a) required or permitted by this Act to be prescribed; or
