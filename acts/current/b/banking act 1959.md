    * Priorities for application of assets of ADI in 

    * (3) If an ADI becomes unable to meet its obligations or suspends payment, the assets of the ADI in  are to be available to meet the ADI's liabilities in the following order:

    * (3A) The assets of an ADI are taken for the purposes of subsection (3) not to include any interest in an asset (or a part of an asset) in a cover pool for which the ADI is the issuing ADI.

    * ADI's assets must at least equal its deposit liabilities

    * (4) An ADI is guilty of an offence if:

     * (a) it does not hold assets (excluding goodwill and any assets or other amount excluded by the prudential standards for the purposes of this subsection) in  of a value that is equal to or greater than the total amount of its deposit liabilities in ; and

     * (b) APRA has not authorised the ADI to hold assets of a lesser value.

    * (5) An offence against subsection (4) is an indictable offence.

    * (6) If the circumstances relating to the asset holdings of an ADI are such that give rise to the ADI committing an offence against subsection (4), the ADI is guilty of an offence against that subsection in respect of:

     * (a) the first day on which the offence is committed; and

     * (b) each subsequent day (if any) on which the circumstances that gave rise to the ADI committing the offence continue (including the day of conviction for any such offence or any later day).

        * Note: This subsection is not intended to imply that section 4K of the _Crimes Act 1914_ does not apply to offences against this Act or the regulations.

     * (b) each subsequent day (if any) on which the circumstances that gave rise to the ADI committing the offence continue (including the day of conviction for any such offence or any later day).

##### 13BA  Start of control of ADI's business by ADI statutory manager

    * (1) After the decision that an ADI statutory manager will take control of an ADI's business is made, APRA must give the ADI written notice that the ADI statutory manager will take, or is taking, control of the business.

        * Note: Subsections 15A(4) and 16A(3) also require APRA to give notice of the taking of control.

    * (2) An ADI statutory manager takes control of an ADI's business:

     * (a) at the time specified in a notice under this section as the time when the ADI statutory manager takes control of the business (which must not be earlier than the notice is given); or

     * (b) if a notice under this section does not specify a time as the time when the ADI statutory manager takes control of the business--at the time the notice is given.

    * (3) A notice under subsection (1) is not a legislative instrument.

##### 13C  ADI statutory managers--termination of control

    * Conditions necessary for termination of control

    * (1) If APRA assumes control of an ADI's business or appoints an administrator of an ADI's business, APRA must ensure that either it or an administrator of the ADI's business has control of the ADI's business until:

     * (a) the following conditions are satisfied:

      * (i) the ADI's deposit liabilities in  have been repaid or APRA is satisfied that suitable provision has been made for their repayment; and

      * (ii) APRA considers that it is no longer necessary for it or an administrator to remain in control of the ADI's business; or

     * (b) APRA considers that the ADI is insolvent and is unlikely to be returned to solvency within a reasonable time, and APRA has applied for the ADI to be wound up under the _Corporations Act 2001_ (see section 14F).

    * A termination of control that is permitted under this section is called an **_ultimate termination of control_**.

        * Note: This provision does not prevent a change, or changes, between control of an ADI's business by APRA and an administrator or between administrators.

    * Events to precede termination

    * (2) Before making an ultimate termination of control by an ADI statutory manager of an ADI's business, APRA must:

     * (a) ensure that directors of the ADI have been appointed or elected under the ADI's constitution at a meeting called by the ADI statutory manager in accordance with the ADI's constitution; or

     * (b) appoint directors of the ADI by instrument in writing; or

     * (c) ensure that a liquidator for the ADI has been appointed.

    * Power to terminate control

    * (3) If the requirements in subsections (1) and (2) are satisfied, APRA may by instrument in writing make an ultimate termination of control of an ADI's business by an ADI statutory manager.

    * (4) If the ADI statutory manager at the time of the termination is an administrator, the instrument of termination also operates as a termination of the appointment of the administrator. A copy of the instrument must be given to the administrator. However, mere failure to give the copy to the administrator does not affect the termination of the appointment.

    * Period of director's appointment

    * (5) If a director is elected or appointed under subsection (2), the director takes office on the termination of the ADI statutory manager's control of the ADI's business. If the director was appointed by APRA, the director holds office until the ADI's next annual general meeting, subject to any terms and conditions imposed by APRA on the director's appointment. If the director was appointed or elected under the ADI's constitution, the constitution governs the appointment.

        * Note: For further information about what happens when an ADI statutory manager is in control of an ADI's business, see Subdivision B.

    * Subsections (1) and (2) apply instead of general indemnity provisions

    * (3) The question whether an ADI statutory manager is liable for a loss is to be determined in accordance with subsections (1) and (2), rather than in accordance with section 70A of this Act or section 58 of the _Australian Prudential Regulation Authority Act 1998_.

    * (4) APRA must inform the external administrator of an ADI that an ADI statutory manager will take control of the ADI's business as soon as possible after the decision that an ADI statutory manager will take control of the ADI's business is made.

     * (b) entitles accountholders who have certain protected accounts with a declared ADI to be paid certain amounts to maintain the accountholders' liquidity before they would receive payment in a winding up of the ADI; and

     * (c) substitutes APRA for those accountholders as a creditor of the declared ADI to the extent of the entitlements.

##### 16AC  APRA's functions relating to this Division

    * APRA's functions include:

     * (a) meeting entitlements under Subdivision C; and

     * (b) preparing, and assisting the Minister to prepare, for the application of that Subdivision in relation to ADIs; and

     * (c) meeting APRA's other obligations under this Division and the regulations made for the purposes of this Division.

##### Subdivision B--Declaration of ADI

##### 16AD  Declaration that Subdivision C applies in relation to ADI

    * (1) The Minister may declare that Subdivision C applies in relation to a specified ADI if APRA has applied under section 14F for the ADI to be wound up.

        * Note: The Minister cannot make a declaration relating to a foreign ADI because APRA cannot apply for a foreign ADI to be wound up: see section 11E.

    * Declaration to specify amount for meeting entitlements

    * (2) The declaration must also specify the amount (if any) that is to be credited to the Financial Claims Scheme Special Account in connection with the application of Subdivision C in relation to the declared ADI. If APRA's application under section 14F was made on or after 12 October 2011, the amount must not be more than $20,000,000,000.

    * (5) The Minister cannot revoke a declaration made under subsection (1).

    * Declaration or amendment not disallowable or subject to expiry

    * Effect of declaration or amendment

    * (7) The declaration or amendment:

     * (a) takes effect from the time it is made, despite subsections 12(1) and (2) of the _Legislative Instruments Act 2003_; and

     * (b) has effect according to its terms.

    * Declaration not to specify ADI by reference to class

    * (8) Subsection 13(3) of the _Legislative Instruments Act 2003_ does not apply to a declaration under subsection (1) specifying an ADI.

        * Note: This ensures that a declaration must specify an ADI individually, and cannot specify it by reference to a class of ADIs.

##### 16AE  Advice and information for decision on making declaration

    * (1) The Minister may give APRA, ASIC or the Reserve Bank a written request for advice or information about a matter relevant to making a decision about making a declaration under section 16AD (including a matter relating to the affairs of an ADI).

    * (3) In making the decision, the Minister must take into account the advice and information (if any) that he or she has been given before making the decision. This does not limit what the Minister may take into account in making the decision.

##### Subdivision C--Payment of accountholders with declared ADI

##### 16AF  Payment of accountholders with declared ADI

    * (1) An accountholder who has a protected account with a net credit balance with a declared ADI at the declaration time is entitled to be paid by APRA an amount equal to the sum of:

    * increased or decreased in accordance with the regulations to take account of clearance, within the period prescribed by the regulations, of transactions connected with the protected account and entered into before the declaration time.

    * (1A) The interest is payable at:

     * (a) the rate of interest that is payable according to the terms and conditions of the protected account; or

     * (b) if APRA considers that that rate is not certain--the rate of interest that APRA declares, in writing, is payable.

    * (1B) A declaration under paragraph (1A)(b) is not a legislative instrument.

    * Joint protected accounts

    * (2) If the account mentioned in subsection (1) is held jointly by 2 or more accountholders with the declared ADI, that subsection entitles each of the accountholders to an equal share of the amount to which one of those accountholders would be entitled if it alone had the account with the declared ADI.

    * Pooled accounts

    * (3) If:

     * (a) one person holds the protected account mentioned in subsection (1); and

     * (b) the person is the trustee of 2 or more trusts; and

     * (c) the net credit balance of the account consists of the trust funds of 2 or more of those trusts;

    * subsection (1) entitles the person to be paid, in connection with that account, the amount worked out under subsection (1).

##### 16AG  Limit on payments to accountholder with declared ADI

    * (1) Despite section 16AF, an accountholder is not entitled under that section to be paid, in connection with the protected account or protected accounts the accountholder has with a particular declared ADI at a particular time, one or more amounts totalling more than the limit prescribed by, or worked out under, the regulations.

    * (2) The regulations may prescribe, or provide for working out, different limits for the purposes of subsection (1) relating to accountholders in different classes.

    * (3) Despite section 16AF, if:

     * (a) the accountholder has 2 or more protected accounts with the declared ADI at that time; and

     * (b) subsection (1) of this section reduces the total amount to which the accountholder would otherwise be entitled under section 16AF in connection with those protected accounts;

    * APRA may determine in writing, for each of the protected accounts, the amount (if any) of the entitlement under that section connected with the protected account (so that the total of the entitlements equals the limit prescribed by, or worked out under, the regulations for the purposes of subsection (1) of this section).

        * Note: Amounts may be determined by reference to a class, or more than one class, of accounts: see subsection 33(3AB) of the _Acts Interpretation Act 1901_.

    * (4) In making the determination, the desirability of the accountholder receiving its entitlements as early as possible is to be taken into account. This does not limit the matters that may be taken into account in making a determination.

##### 16AH  Payment

    * Various ways of meeting entitlement

    * (1) An accountholder's entitlement under this Subdivision to be paid an amount may be met:

     * (a) by paying the amount to the accountholder as a single amount or in instalments determined by APRA; or

     * (b) by applying the amount, as a single amount or in instalments determined by APRA, for the accountholder's benefit, by establishing an account with an ADI on behalf of the accountholder or in another way; or

     * (c) by paying part of the amount to the accountholder and applying the rest of the amount for the accountholder's benefit.

    * (2) The regulations may make provision for or in relation to the ways in which accountholders' entitlements under this Subdivision to be paid amounts may be met.

    * Establishment of account by APRA for meeting entitlement

    * (3) APRA may establish, on behalf of an accountholder who has an entitlement under this Subdivision, an account with an ADI (except a declared ADI) for the purposes of wholly or partly meeting the entitlement.

    * (4) Subsection (3) has effect:

     * (a) whether or not the accountholder consents to the establishment of the account; and

     * (b) despite any other law of the Commonwealth relating to the establishment of such an account.

    * (5) If an accountholder has an entitlement under this Subdivision connected with a protected account of a kind prescribed by the regulations for the purposes of this subsection, APRA must establish an account of the same kind on behalf of the accountholder for the purposes of wholly or partly meeting the entitlement.

    * Act to meet entitlement is not provision of designated service

    * (6) An act done by any of the following persons for the purposes of meeting an accountholder's entitlement under this Subdivision is taken, for the purposes of the _AntiMoney Laundering and CounterTerrorism Financing Act 2006_, not to be the provision of a designated service by the person:

     * (a) APRA;

     * (b) the Reserve Bank.

        * Note: One effect of subsection (6) is that the person's act does not make the person a reporting entity for the purposes of the _AntiMoney Laundering and CounterTerrorism Financing Act 2006_.

    * Exemption from section 32 of AntiMoney Laundering Act

    * (7) Section 32 of the _AntiMoney Laundering and CounterTerrorism Financing Act 2006_ does not apply to a designated service described in item 1 of the table in subsection 6(2) of that Act provided by an ADI as a result of the exercise of APRA's power under subsection (3) of this section (whether or not subsection (5) required APRA to exercise that power).

##### 16AHA  Giving information about payments in a financial year

    * (1) This section applies if one or more amounts are paid to, or applied for the benefit of, one or more accountholders in a financial year to meet (wholly or partly) the accountholders' entitlements under this Subdivision.

    * (2) Within 14 days after the end of the financial year, APRA must give each of those accountholders a statement about the amounts paid to, or applied for the benefit of, the accountholder in the financial year. The statement must:

     * (a) be in the approved form; and

     * (b) name the accountholder; and

     * (c) state the accountholder's tax file number, if APRA knows it; and

     * (d) state the total of the amounts and the total of the amounts (if any) withheld from them under the _Taxation Administration Act 1953_; and

     * (e) specify the financial year to which the statement relates.

    * Giving the Commissioner of Taxation an annual report

    * (3) Within 4 months after the end of the financial year, APRA must give the Commissioner a report in the approved form about all the amounts described in subsection (1).

    * Provisions about statements and reports in approved forms

    * (4) Division 388 in Schedule 1 to the _Taxation Administration Act 1953_ applies as if this section were a taxation law for the purposes of that Act.

        * Note: That Division sets out rules about approved forms and when they can be given.

    * This section does not limit the Taxation Administration Act 1953

    * (5) Subsection (4) does not limit the operation of the _Taxation Administration Act 1953_ in relation to APRA.

##### 16AI  Substitution of APRA for accountholder as ADI's creditor

    * (1) When an ADI becomes a declared ADI, then, by force of this subsection, the right of an accountholder who has a protected account with the ADI to be paid an amount by the ADI in connection with the account:

     * (a) is reduced to the extent of the accountholder's entitlement under this Subdivision connected with the account; and

     * (b) to the extent of the reduction, becomes a right of APRA.

    * (2) APRA may exercise or assign a right it has under paragraph (1)(b).

        * Note: Under section 11 of the _Australian Prudential Regulation Authority Act 1998_, APRA's property is generally held on behalf of the Commonwealth.

##### Subdivision D--Administration

     * (c) transferring the entitlements of account holders to accounts held by the account holders in another ADI.

    * (4) The liquidator must give compliance with a notice issued under subsection (1) precedence over the other aspects of winding up the ADI, including any requirements under the _Corporations Act 2001_.

    * (5) However, the liquidator is not required to comply with a notice issued under subsection (1) unless there is sufficient available property to meet the liquidator's costs likely to be incurred in complying with the notice in full, unless APRA indemnifies the liquidator for those costs.

    * (6) The liquidator has the powers that are necessary or convenient to comply with a notice issued under subsection (1).

      * Penalty: 200 penalty units.

    * (3) An offence against subsection (2) is an indictable offence.

        * Note: Section 4K (Continuing and multiple offences) of the _Crimes Act 1914_ applies to an offence against subsection (2) relating to subsection 16AK(1), so an ADI commits an offence for each day it does not comply with a requirement under that subsection (to give information within a particular time).

     * (b) the officer's duties include ensuring that the ADI complies with the requirement.

      * Penalty: 50 penalty units.

    * (5) Subsection (4) does not apply to an officer who is a liquidator (including a provisional liquidator) of the ADI.

        * Note: A defendant bears an evidential burden in relation to the matter in subsection (5): see subsection 13.3(3) of the _Criminal Code_.

    * (6) If an officer of an ADI fails to take reasonable steps to ensure that the ADI complies with a requirement made of it under subsection 16AK(1) in circumstances that give rise to the officer committing an offence against subsection (4) of this section, the officer commits an offence against that subsection in respect of:

     * (a) the first day on which the offence is committed; and

     * (b) each subsequent day (if any) on which the circumstances that gave rise to the officer committing the offence continue (including the day of conviction for any such offence or any later day).

##### 16AO  APRA's costs of administration

    * (1) The costs incurred by APRA in relation to the exercise of its powers and the performance of its functions under this Division relating to a declared ADI are a debt due by the declared ADI to APRA.

    * (2) The debt is admissible to proof against the declared ADI in the winding up of the ADI.

    * (3) Subsection (1) does not apply to the amounts of entitlements under Subdivision C.

        * Note: This section overrides any requirements imposed on the liquidator by the _Corporations Act 2001_ and regulations under that Act in relation to proof of the debt or claim and a decision whether to admit or reject the debt or claim: see section 70B of this Act.

##### 16AR  How liquidator must pay distributions to accountholder
