#### Division 1--Simplified outline

##### 73  Simplified outline

       *  	Industry codes may be registered by the ACMA.

       *  	Compliance with an industry code is voluntary unless the ACMA directs a particular participant in the content industry to comply with the code.

       *  	The ACMA has a reserve power to make an industry standard if there are no industry codes or if an industry code is deficient.

       *  	Compliance with industry standards is mandatory.

#### Division 2--Interpretation

#### Division 3--General principles relating to industry codes and industry standards

##### 80  Statement of regulatory policy

     * (1) The Parliament intends that bodies or associations that the ACMA is satisfied represent sections of the content industry should develop codes (**_industry codes_**) that are to apply to participants in the respective sections of the industry in relation to their content activities.

     * (2) The Parliament intends that the ACMA should make reasonable efforts to ensure that, for each section of the content industry, either:

       * (a) an industry code is registered under this Part within 6 months after the commencement of this Schedule; or

       * (b) an industry standard is registered under this Part within 9 months after the commencement of this Schedule.

##### 81  Matters that must be dealt with by industry codes and industry standards--commercial content providers

     * (1) The Parliament intends that, for the commercial content service provider section of the content industry, there should be:

       * (a) an industry code or an industry standard that deals with; or

       * (b) an industry code and an industry standard that together deal with;

     * each of the following matters: 

       * (c) the engagement of trained content assessors by commercial content service providers;

       * (d) ensuring that content (other than live content or content that consists of an eligible electronic publication) that:

        * (i) has not been classified by the Classification Board; and

        * (ii) would, if it were classified by the Classification Board, be substantially likely to be classified RC, X 18+, R 18+ or MA 15+ by the Classification Board;

       * is not provided by commercial content services (other than news services or current affairs services) unless a trained content assessor has assessed the content for the purposes of categorising the content as:

        * (iii) content that would, if it were classified by the Classification Board, be substantially likely to be classified RC by the Classification Board; or

        * (iv) content that would, if it were classified by the Classification Board, be substantially likely to be classified X 18+ by the Classification Board; or

        * (v) content that would, if it were classified by the Classification Board, be substantially likely to be classified R 18+ by the Classification Board; or

        * (vi) content that would, if it were classified by the Classification Board, be substantially likely to be classified MA 15+ by the Classification Board;

       * (e) ensuring that live content is not provided by commercial content services (other than news services or current affairs services) unless:

        * (i) there is no reasonable likelihood that the live content will be of a kind that would, if it were classified by the Classification Board, be substantially likely to be classified RC, X 18+, R 18+ or MA 15+ by the Classification Board; or

        * (ii) a trained content assessor has given advice to the relevant commercial content service provider about whether the live content is likely to be of a kind that would, if it were classified by the Classification Board, be substantially likely to be classified RC, X 18+, R 18+ or MA 15+ by the Classification Board;

       * (f) ensuring that content that consists of an eligible electronic publication that:

        * (i) has not been classified by the Classification Board; and

        * (ii) would, if it were classified by the Classification Board, be substantially likely to be classified RC or category 2 restricted by the Classification Board;

       * is not provided by commercial content services (other than news services or current affairs services) unless a trained content assessor has assessed the content for the purposes of categorising the content as:

        * (iii) content that would, if it were classified by the Classification Board, be substantially likely to be classified RC by the Classification Board; or

        * (iv) content that would, if it were classified by the Classification Board, be substantially likely to be classified category 2 restricted by the Classification Board.
