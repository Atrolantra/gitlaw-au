     * (i) commences on (and includes):

      * (A) the day on which the provisional grant of the licence is properly accepted; or

      * (B) an anniversary of that day; and

     * (ii) ends at the end of the term of the licence.

   * (2) Expressions used in this Act that are used in the _Offshore Minerals Act 1994 _have, unless the contrary intention appears, the same meaning as they have in that Act.

##### 4  Works licence fees

   * (1) A works licence holder must pay to the Designated Authority, in respect of each year of the term of the licence, a fee calculated at the rate prescribed by the regulations for each hectare or part of a hectare of the works area.

   * (2) The works area for a works licence is the area specified in the licence under paragraph 278(1)(c) of the _Offshore Minerals Act 1994_.

   * (3) Subject to subsection (4), the amount of the fee is to be calculated at the prescribed rate for each hectare or part of a hectare of the licence area.

   * (4) The prescribed rate is not to exceed $100 per hectare or part of a hectare.

##### 4A  Holder liable to pay fee

   * (1) The licence holder is liable to pay the fee.

   * (2) If the licence has 2 or more holders, the holders are jointly and severally liable to pay the fee.

##### 4B  Time for payment

   * The fee for a year becomes payable one month after the day on which the year begins.

##### 5  Penalty for late payment

   * Where the liability of the holder of a works licence to pay a fee referred to in section 4 is not discharged at or before the time when the fee is payable, there is payable to the Designated Authority by the holder an additional amount calculated at the rate of one-third of 1% per day upon the amount of the fee from time to time remaining unpaid, to be computed from the time when the fee became payable until it is paid.

##### 6  Fees and penalties debts due to Commonwealth

   * (1) A fee under section 4, and an amount payable under section 5, are debts due by the holder of a works licence to the Commonwealth and are recoverable in a court of competent jurisdiction.

   * (2) Fees and other amounts referred to in subsection (1) received by the Designated Authority shall be deemed to be received by the Designated Authority on behalf of the Commonwealth.
