**_READER'S GUIDE_**


     * _**_Purpose of the Reader's Guide_

     * _The purpose of this Guide is to make it easier for you to read the Act. It gives you information about the scope, coverage and organisation of the Act and it alerts you to some of the basic concepts used in the Act. It also tells you about some of the features of the Act so that you can read the Act more efficiently.

     * _Scope of the Act_

     * _The Act deals with 2 related matters:

      * *	setting up a licensing system for mining and exploration in particular offshore areas; and

      * *	applying State laws to those offshore areas so far as those laws concern mining and exploration activities.

     * The provisions dealing with the first matter take up most of the Act. The second matter is dealt with in Part 5.1.

     * _Basic concepts_

     * _The Act uses a number of basic concepts and some of these concepts are sophisticated and difficult. If you are reading the Act for the first time, you should go to Division 2 of Part 1.2 first and familiarise yourself with these basic concepts before going on to read the other provisions of the Act.

     * The main basic concepts are: 

      * *	a Commonwealth-State offshore area (an **_offshore area_** if you are already familiar with the _Offshore Petroleum and Greenhouse Gas Storage Act 2006_);

      * *	blocks and the different kinds of blocks (standard, reserved and tender blocks);

      * *	minerals;

      * *	exploration;

      * *	mining.

     * _The bodies with decision-making powers_

     * _The administration of the Act is generally shared between the Commonwealth Government and the State Governments. This means that the various decision-making powers under the Act are given to different bodies. Part 1.3 explains who these bodies are. The State body is called the Designated Authority. The body that represents the Commonwealth and State Governments acting together is called the Joint Authority.

     * It is important to familiarise yourself with this terminology and to keep the distinction between the different authorities in mind when you read the provisions of the Act.

     * An important feature of the licensing system is that the Joint Authority always acts through the corresponding Designated Authority. The Joint Authority's decisions are carried out by the Designated Authority. Applicants and licence holders always deal with the Designated Authority and do not deal directly with the Joint Authority, although the Joint Authority is the ultimate decision-maker.

     * The Act also deals with exploration and mining in the offshore areas off external territories. Although special provision is sometimes made for the external territories, the general approach is to give the Commonwealth Minister the powers of both Designated Authority and Joint Authority (see subsections 29(3) and 32(3)).

     * _The licensing scheme_

     * _Different activities require different authorisations. The Act provides for 5 kinds of authorisation:

      * *	exploration licences;

      * *	retention licences;

      * *	mining licences;

      * *	works licences;

      * *	special purpose consents.

     * The Act deals with these authorisations in this order. The provisions dealing with each authorisation begin with a statement of the activities authorised by that particular authorisation and go on to deal with:

      * *	applications;

      * *	grant;

      * *	duration;

      * *	renewal;

      * *	obligations of the holder;

      * *	expiry.

     * You can use the table of provisions to **_home in_** on the authorisation and the topic you are interested in. Where necessary, the Act will cross refer you to related provisions that you might otherwise overlook or not find easy to locate. These cross references will be found in the Notes at the end of sections and subsections.

     * _Registration and dealings_

     * _Chapter 3 deals with the related topics of registration and dealings in licences.

     * _Administration_

     * _Chapter 4 deals with the administration of the licensing system including:

      * *	information gathering powers;

      * *	compliance inspections;

      * *	the giving of directions;

      * *	the lodgment and use of securities;

      * *	restoration and rehabilitation action.

## Chapter 1--Introduction

### Part 1.1--Legislative formalities and background

     * 1**  Short title** [_see_ Note 1]

     * This Act may be cited as the _Offshore Minerals Act 1994_.

     * 2**  Commencement** [_see_ Note 1]

     * This Act commences on the day on which it receives the Royal Assent.

##### 3  Commonwealth-State agreement (the Offshore Constitutional Settlement)

     * (1) The Commonwealth and the States have agreed that:

      * (a) Commonwealth offshore mining legislation should be limited to the area that is outside State coastal waters; and

      * (b) the States should share, in the manner provided by this Act, in the administration of the Commonwealth offshore mining legislation; and

      * (c) State offshore mining legislation should apply to State coastal waters beyond the baseline for the territorial sea (that is, the first 3 nautical miles of the territorial sea); and

      * (d) the Commonwealth and the States should try to maintain, as far as practicable, common principles, rules and practices in regulating and controlling offshore mining beyond the baseline of Australia's territorial sea.

       * Note: So far as the agreement relates to petroleum, it is reflected in Commonwealth legislation by the _Offshore Petroleum and Greenhouse Gas Storage Act 2006_.

     * (2) Other Acts that provide background to the agreement (commonly referred to as the **_Offshore Constitutional Settlement_**) are:

      * (a) the _Seas and Submerged Lands Act 1973_; and

      * (b) the _Coastal Waters (State Powers) Act 1980_; and

      * (c) the _Coastal Waters (State Title) Act 1980_; and

      * (d) the _Offshore Petroleum and Greenhouse Gas Storage Act 2006_; and

      * (e) the _Coastal Waters (Northern Territory Powers) Act 1980_; and

      * (f) the _Coastal Waters (Northern Territory Title) Act 1980_.

       * Note 1: The _Seas and Submerged Lands Act 1973:_

        * _declared and enacted that the sovereignty in respect of the territorial sea and the associated airspace, seabed and subsoil is vested in and exercisable by the Crown in right of the Commonwealth;

        * gave the Governor-General power to declare, by Proclamation, the limits of the territorial sea;

        * declared and enacted that the sovereignty in respect of waters of the sea that are on the landward side of the baseline of the territorial sea (but not within the limits of a State) and in respect of the associated airspace, seabed and subsoil is vested in and exercisable by the Crown in right of the Commonwealth;

        * declared and enacted that the sovereign rights of Australia as a coastal State in respect of the Continental Shelf of Australia (for the purpose of exploring it and exploiting its natural resources) are vested in and exercisable by the Crown in right of the Commonwealth;

        * gave the Governor-General power to declare, by Proclamation, the limits of the Continental Shelf of Australia.

       * Note 2: The _Coastal Waters (State Powers) Act 1980 _was enacted following a request from the Parliaments of all the States under paragraph 51(xxxviii) of the Constitution of the Commonwealth and provided that the legislative powers exercisable under the Constitution of each State extended to the making of certain laws that would operate offshore.

       * Note 3: The _Coastal Waters (State Title) Act 1980 _vested in each State certain property rights in the seabed beneath the coastal waters of the State.

       * Note 4: The _Offshore Petroleum and Greenhouse Gas Storage Act 2006 _makes provision, based on the agreement referred to in subsection (1), for the licensing regime that applies to the exploration for and recovery of petroleum in offshore areas.

       * Note 5: The _Coastal Waters (Northern Territory Powers) Act 1980 _makes similar provision to the State Powers Act in relation to the Northern Territory.

       * Note 6: The _Coastal Waters (Northern Territory Title) Act 1980 _makes similar provision to the State Title Act in relation to the Northern Territory.

##### Division 2--Basic concepts

##### 13  Commonwealth-State offshore areas

     * (1) The Commonwealth-State offshore area for a State is the area that is the offshore area for the State for the purposes of the _Offshore Petroleum and Greenhouse Gas Storage Act 2006_.

       * Note: The **_offshore area_**  for the purposes of the _Offshore Petroleum and Greenhouse Gas Storage Act 2006 _is worked out by taking an area off the coast of the State that is described in Schedule 1 to that Act and then excluding all waters within a line 3 nautical miles seaward of the territorial sea baseline and also excluding any areas that are beyond the outer limits of the Continental Shelf. The map in subsection 5(3) of that Act illustrates the offshore areas.

     * (2) The following diagram illustrates how a Commonwealth-State offshore area relates to:

      * (a) the territorial sea baseline; and

      * (b) the 3 nautical mile limit (the outer limit of the State's coastal waters); and

      * (c) the 12 nautical mile limit (the outer limit of the territorial sea); and

      * (d) the outer limits of the Continental Shelf.

       * Note 1: For the **_baseline_** see _Australia's territorial sea baseline _(AGPS) 1988: generally the baseline is the lowest astronomical tide along the coast but it also includes lines enclosing bays and indentations that are not bays and straight baselines that depart from the coast.

       * Note 2: The **_Continental Shelf_** in a legal sense starts not from the coast but from the outer limits of the territorial sea. In a geophysical sense, of course, the continental shelf starts at the coast. The diagram shows the outer edge of the continental margin as the limit of the Continental Shelf but sometimes the 200 nautical mile limit defines the limit of the Continental Shelf.

       * Note 3: Sometimes the outer limit of the Commonwealth-State offshore area is a bilaterally negotiated boundary or a median line adopted pending bilateral negotiations.

##### 14  External territory offshore areas

     * (1) The external territory offshore area for the Territory of Ashmore and Cartier Islands is the area that is the offshore area for that Territory for the purposes of the _Offshore Petroleum and Greenhouse Gas Storage Act 2006_.

       * Note 1: The **_offshore area_**  for the Territory of Ashmore and Cartier Islands for the purposes of the _Offshore Petroleum and Greenhouse Gas Storage Act 2006 _is worked out by taking the area off the coast of the territory that is described in Schedule 1 to that Act and then excluding any areas that are beyond the Continental Shelf.

       * Note 2: Under the _Offshore Petroleum and Greenhouse Gas Storage Act 2006_, any land that is in the offshore area for the Territory of Ashmore and Cartier Islands is treated as submerged land and as part of the seabed and subsoil of that offshore area.

     * (2) The external territory offshore area for Norfolk Island, the Territory of Heard Island and McDonald Islands, Christmas Island and Cocos (Keeling) Islands is the area which starts at the coastline of the Islands at mean low water and ends at the outer limit of the superjacent waters of the Continental Shelf adjacent to the coast of the islands.

       * Note: Under the _Offshore Petroleum and Greenhouse Gas Storage Act 2006_, the Coral Sea area is treated as being part of the offshore area for Queensland. Therefore, in this Act, the Coral Sea area is part of the Commonwealth-Queensland offshore area.

      * (c) as a result of the change to, or reassessment of the location of, the baseline, the area ceases to be within an offshore area;

     * this Act applies as if the area were still within the offshore area.

     * (2) Subsection (1) continues to apply to the area only while the licence (and any successor licence) remains in force.

     * (3) If:

      * (a) a State offshore mining licence has been granted on the basis that an area is within the State's coastal waters; and

      * (b) take a bounded space defined by the grid;

      * (c) the seabed and subsoil within the offshore area that is under that space is a block in the offshore area.

     * (2) The following diagram shows how a block is constituted:

       * Note: Each block is identified by giving the name of the plan in the 1:1,000,000 map series, an identifying number of the 5 minute primary block and a letter identifying the 1 minute block. The block in the diagram is 1621(a) on the Darwin sheet.

### Part 1.4--Application of this Act

##### 35  Act does not apply to exploration for or recovery of petroleum

     * This Act does not apply to the exploration for or recovery of petroleum.

       * Note 1: For **_petroleum_** see section 4.

       * Note 2: Offshore petroleum exploration and mining are regulated by the _Offshore Petroleum and Greenhouse Gas Storage Act 2006_.

##### 36  Act extends to certain external territories

     * This Act extends to the following external territories: 

      * (a) the Territory of Ashmore and Cartier Islands;

      * (b) Norfolk Island;

      * (c) the Territory of Heard Island and McDonald Islands;

      * (d) Christmas Island;

      * (e) the Territory of Cocos (Keeling) Islands;

      * (f) the Coral Sea Islands Territory.

       * Note 1: This Act treats the Coral Sea Islands Territory offshore area as part of Queensland's offshore area.

       * Note 2: This Act operates in a Commonwealth-State offshore area on the basis of shared administration between the Commonwealth and the State and this involves sharing powers between Designated Authorities and Joint Authorities. In external territory offshore areas, the responsible Commonwealth Minister exercises all the powers and therefore has both Designated Authority powers and Joint Authority powers. When the Commonwealth-State offshore area regime requires communication and consultation between Designated Authorities and Joint Authorities, this Act contains special provisions dealing with external territory offshore areas (see, for example, section 64).

      * (b) recover minerals from an offshore area;

     * unless the exploration or recovery is authorised by a licence or special purpose consent granted under this Act.

       * Note: A works licence may be necessary because **_exploration_** includes activities that are directly related to exploration (see subsection 23(1)) and **_recovery_** includes activities that are directly related to recovery (see subsection 24(1)).

       * Maximum penalty: 300 penalty units.

        * an exploration licence leading to a mining licence;

        * an exploration licence leading to a retention licence and then a mining licence;

        * a mining licence (without progressing through an exploration/retention licence stage).

       * Note 5: A licence is granted over a particular area (constituted by blocks). The licence holder may need to carry out engineering or other activities outside the licence area. If so, the licence holder or someone else must obtain a works licence to carry out those activities.

       * Note 6: If a person wants to carry out:

        * a scientific investigation; or

        * a reconnaissance survey; or

        * the collection of only small amounts of minerals;

     * (1) The grant of a licence or special purpose consent under this Act does not extinguish native title in the licence or consent area.

     * (2) While a licence or consent under this Act is in force over an area, native title in the area is subject to the rights conferred by the licence or consent.

##### 132  Retention licences

     * This Part provides for the grant of retention licences over blocks in an offshore area.

       * Note: A retention licence is designed to allow an exploration licence holder to retain rights over an area if:

        * the holder has identified and evaluated a significant mineral deposit in the exploration licence area; and

        * mining the deposit is not commercially viable in the short term for some reason (for example, the political situation, the prevailing situation in the commodity market for particular minerals, the need to arrange finance or build up capital reserves, the need to develop new technologies or the impending development of new technologies); and

        * there is a reasonable prospect of development of the deposit in the longer term.

       * See section 145 for the grounds on which a retention licence may be granted.

##### 133  Activities authorised by a retention licence

     * (1) Subject to subsections (2) and (3), a retention licence holder may:

      * (a) explore for minerals in the licence area; and

      * (b) recover minerals in the licence area.

       * Note 1: The retention licence may specify a restricted range of activities that are the only ones authorised by the licence (see subsection 146(3)).

       * Note 2: Under subsection 23(1) the concept of **_exploration_** extends to activities that are directly related to exploration.

       * Note 3: Under subsection 24(1) the concept of **_recovery_** extends to activities that are directly related to the recovery of minerals.

     * (2) A retention licence does not authorise the recovery of minerals as part of a commercial mining operation.

     * (3) If the licence is expressed to restrict the kind of minerals covered by the licence, the holder is not permitted to explore for, or to recover, minerals not covered by the licence.

     * (4) A restriction on the kind of minerals covered by the licence may be inclusive (for example, only minerals A, B and C) or exclusive (for example, all minerals except A, B and C).

     * (5) For the purposes of subsection (3), the holder does not recover an excluded mineral if, in the course of exploring for, or recovering, another mineral, the holder recovers some excluded mineral.

##### 134  Joint Authority may cancel or not renew retention licence without compensation

     * No compensation is payable because of the cancellation or non-renewal of a retention licence by the Joint Authority.

       * Note 1: The Joint Authority may cancel the licence under section 189 or 190.

       * Note 2: The Joint Authority may refuse under section 165 or 166 to renew the licence.

##### 135  Licence rights may be suspended

     * (1) The Joint Authority must suspend particular rights conferred by a retention licence if the Joint Authority is satisfied that it is necessary in the national interest to do so.

     * (2) The Joint Authority may suspend rights under subsection (1) for a specified period or for an indefinite period.

     * (3) The Joint Authority may end a suspension at any time.

      * (b) ends a suspension;

     * the Joint Authority must give the licence holder a written notice that informs the holder of the suspension or the ending of a suspension.

       * Note: See section 181 for the effect of the suspension on the obligations associated with the licence.

     * (6) A suspension takes effect when:

      * (a) the holder has been given notice of the suspension under subsection (5); and

      * (b) the suspension has been registered under section 337.

##### 136  Compensation for acquisition of property due to suspension of rights

     * (1) If:

      * (a) the Joint Authority suspends licence rights under section 135; and

      * (b) the suspension results in the acquisition of property from a person; and
