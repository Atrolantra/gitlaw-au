### An Act about petroleum exploration and recovery, and the injection and storage of greenhouse gas substances, in offshore areas, and for other purposes

## Chapter 1--Introduction

### Part 1.1--Legislative formalities and background

##### 1  Short title

    * This Act may be cited as the _Offshore Petroleum and Greenhouse Gas Storage Act 2006_.

##### 2  Commencement

    * (1) Each provision of this Act specified in column 1 of the table commences, or is taken to have commenced, in accordance with column 2 of the table. Any other statement in column 2 has effect according to its terms.

        * Note: This table relates only to the provisions of this Act as originally passed by the Parliament and assented to. It will not be expanded to deal with provisions inserted in this Act after assent.

    * (2) Column 3 of the table contains additional information that is not part of this Act. Information in this column may be added to or edited in any published version of this Act.

##### 3  Object

    * The object of this Act is to provide an effective regulatory framework for: 

     * (a) petroleum exploration and recovery; and

     * (b) the injection and storage of greenhouse gas substances;

    * in offshore areas.

##### 4  Simplified outline

    * The following is a simplified outline of this Act: 

     *  	This Act sets up a system for regulating the following activities in offshore areas: 

        * (a) exploration for petroleum;

        * (b) recovery of petroleum;

        * (c) construction and operation of infrastructure facilities relating to petroleum or greenhouse gas substances;

        * (d) construction and operation of pipelines for conveying petroleum or greenhouse gas substances;

        * (e) exploration for potential greenhouse gas storage formations;

        * (f) injection and storage of greenhouse gas substances.

     *  	An offshore area: 

        * (a) starts 3 nautical miles from the baseline from which the breadth of the territorial sea is measured; and

        * (b) extends seaward to the outer limits of the continental shelf.

     *  	This Act provides for the grant of the following titles: 

        * (a) a petroleum exploration permit (see Part 2.2);

        * (b) a petroleum retention lease (see Part 2.3);

        * (c) a petroleum production licence (see Part 2.4);

        * (d) an infrastructure licence (see Part 2.5);

        * (e) a pipeline licence (see Part 2.6);

        * (f) a petroleum special prospecting authority (see Part 2.7);

        * (g) a petroleum access authority (see Part 2.8);

        * (h) a greenhouse gas assessment permit (see Part 3.2);

        * (i) a greenhouse gas holding lease (see Part 3.3);

        * (j) a greenhouse gas injection licence (see Part 3.4);

        * (k) a greenhouse gas search authority (see Part 3.5);

        * (l) a greenhouse gas special authority (see Part 3.6).

     *  	Generally, the administration of this Act in relation to an offshore area of a State is the responsibility of the Joint Authority for the State. The Joint Authority for a State (other than Tasmania) is constituted by the responsible State Minister and the responsible Commonwealth Minister. The Joint Authority for Tasmania is constituted by the responsible Commonwealth Minister.

     *  	Generally, the administration of this Act in relation to the Principal Northern Territory offshore area is the responsibility of the Joint Authority for that area (the Joint Authority is constituted by the responsible Northern Territory Minister and the responsible Commonwealth Minister).

     *  	The responsible Commonwealth Minister is responsible for the administration of greenhouse gas injection and storage provisions.

     *  	The National Offshore Petroleum Safety and Environmental Management Authority is responsible for the administration of: 

        * (a) occupational health and safety provisions; and

        * (b) structural integrity provisions; and

        * (c) environmental management provisions.

     *  	The National Offshore Petroleum Titles Administrator is responsible for: 

        * (a) assisting and advising the Joint Authority and the responsible Commonwealth Minister; and

        * (b) keeping registers of titles; and

        * (c) data and information management.

        * Note: Generally, the **_baseline_** is the line of lowest astronomical tide along the coast, but it also encompasses straight lines across bays (bay closing lines), rivers (river closing lines) and between islands, as well as along heavily indented areas of coastline (straight baselines) under certain circumstances.

##### 5  CommonwealthState agreement (the Offshore Constitutional Settlement)

    * (1) This section explains the agreement known as the Offshore Constitutional Settlement, to the extent to which that agreement relates to exploring for, and exploiting, petroleum.

    * (2) The Commonwealth, the States and the  have agreed that:

     * (a) Commonwealth offshore petroleum legislation should be limited to the area that is outside the coastal waters of the States and the ; and

     * (b) for this purpose, the outer limits of State and Northern Territory coastal waters should start 3 nautical miles from the baseline of the territorial sea; and

     * (c) the States and the  should share, in the manner provided by this Act, in the administration of the Commonwealth offshore petroleum legislation; and

     * (d) State and  offshore petroleum legislation should apply to State and  coastal waters; and

     * (e) the Commonwealth, the States and the  should try to maintain, as far as practicable, common principles, rules and practices in regulating and controlling the exploration for, and exploitation of, offshore petroleum beyond the baseline of 's territorial sea.

    * (3) The table summarises other Acts that provide background to the Offshore Constitutional Settlement:

##### 6  Simplified maps

    * (1) This section sets out simplified maps illustrating areas off the coast of  that are relevant to this Act.

    * (2) In the interests of simplification:

     * (a) coastlines and boundaries have been smoothed; and

     * (b) the maps do not show certain waters within the limits of a State or Territory; and

     * (c) the line marking the outer limits of the coastal waters of a State or Territory appears to be further out to sea than it actually is.

    * Map 1

    * (3) Map 1 illustrates the offshore areas and the scheduled areas:
