        * Example: A petroleum exploration permit has been granted for a period of 6 years ending on 31 March 2015. The permit is extended under section 265 for a period of 6 months ending on 30 September 2015, after which it ceases to be in force. Annual titles administration levy is imposed under the Regulatory Levies Act for the year beginning on 1 April 2015.

        * Because the permit ceases to be in force before the end of the year beginning on 1 April 2015, the regulations may make provision for the remittal or refund of part (or all) of the amount of the levy imposed for that year.

    * (3A) Regulations made for the purposes of subsection (3) may provide for different amounts to be remitted or refunded depending on matters including the following:

     * (a) when the title ceases (or will cease) to be in force;

     * (b) the kind of title on which levy is imposed;

     * (c) in the case of a title that partly ceases (or will cease) to be in force--the number of blocks, or the length of pipeline, as to which the title ceases (or will cease) to be in force.

        * Example: For paragraph (c), a title partly ceases to be in force if it is surrendered as to a certain number of blocks or a certain length of pipeline under section 271.

    * Late payment penalty

    * (4) If annual titles administration levy payable by a person under the Regulatory Levies Act remains wholly or partly unpaid after it becomes due and payable, the person is liable to pay a late payment penalty under this section.

    * (5) The late payment penalty is calculated at the rate of 0.333333% per day on the amount of the annual titles administration levy remaining unpaid.

    * (6) The Titles Administrator may remit the whole or a part of an amount of late payment penalty if the Titles Administrator considers that there are good reasons for doing so.

    * Recovery of annual titles administration levy and late payment penalty

    * (7) Each amount of annual titles administration levy, and each amount of late payment penalty payable in respect of titles administration levy:

     * (a) is a debt due to the Titles Administrator on behalf of the Commonwealth; and
