        * (g) whether or not the mortgagor who was the borrower, or a person who represented that mortgagor, was reasonably able to protect the interests of that mortgagor because of his or her physical or mental condition;

        * (h) the form of the contract, mortgage or guarantee and the intelligibility of the language in which it is expressed;

        * (i) whether or not, and if so when, independent legal or other expert advice was obtained by the borrower, mortgagor or guarantor;

        * (j) the extent to which the provisions of the contract, mortgage or guarantee or change and their legal and practical effect were accurately explained to the borrower, mortgagor or guarantor and whether or not the borrower, mortgagor or guarantor understood those provisions and their effect;

          * (iii) the fact that the interest rates applicable to subsidised advances and loans secured by specified portfolio assets are determined under this Act; and

          * (iv) the fact that, in some circumstances, the credit provider would not provide advances to an eligible person if the making of the advance were assessed on ordinary commercial lending criteria instead of the criteria set out in this Act or the agreement; but

        * (b) is not to have regard to:

          * (i) any inequality in bargaining power between the Corporation or the credit provider, and the borrower, that arose because the borrower was able to obtain a subsidised advance from the Corporation or credit provider and not from another financial institution; or

          * (ii) the borrower's age.

      * (3) For the purposes of paragraph (1)(f) or (g), a person is taken to have represented a mortgagor or guarantor if the person represented the mortgagor or guarantor, or assisted the mortgagor or guarantor to a significant degree, in the negotiations process before, or at, the time the mortgage or guarantee was entered into or changed.

##### 23C  Unforeseen circumstances

        * (d) order that the credit provider take any steps that are necessary to discharge the mortgage;

      * (3) For the purposes of this section, a fee or charge payable on early termination of, or a prepayment of an amount under, the relevant contract, mortgage or guarantee is unconscionable if, and only if, it appears to the court that it exceeds a reasonable estimate of the credit provider's loss arising from the early termination or prepayment, including the credit provider's average reasonable administrative costs in respect of such a termination or prepayment.

##### 23G  Time limit

      * (1) An application under section 23AA may not be brought more than 2 years after the relevant contract, mortgage or guarantee is rescinded or discharged or the credit provider writes off the relevant debt, whichever occurs first.

##### 32  Rate of interest on widow or widower advances

      * The rate of interest that shall be specified under paragraph 17(3)(d) in a certificate of entitlement in relation to a widow or widower advance that a person may seek from a credit provider is 3.75% per year.

      * The rate of interest that must be specified under paragraph 17(3)(d) in a certificate of entitlement in relation to an additional advance that a person may seek from a credit provider is 6.85% per year.

##### 34  Rate of interest on further advances

      * (1) Subject to subsection (2), the rate of interest that is to be specified under paragraph 17(3)(d) in a certificate of entitlement in relation to a further advance that a person may seek from a credit provider is the rate of interest per year (disregarding section 35AA) of the last preceding previous advance.

      * (2) If, at the time when subsidy is or was most recently payable in relation to the last preceding previous advance, subsidy is or was payable in respect of the person in relation to one or more other previous advances:

        * (a) the rates of interest that are to be specified under paragraph 17(3)(c) in a certificate of entitlement in relation to a further advance that a person may seek from the credit provider are the rates of interest per year that applied (disregarding section 35AA) to those previous advances; and

        * (b) in relation to each such interest rate--the proportion of the further advance to be so specified in relation to that interest rate is the proportion of the sum of amounts outstanding in respect of all the previous advances that are amounts to which that interest rate applies.

      * (2A) For the purposes of this section, in determining the rate of interest that was payable in relation to a previous advance at any time before 5 January 1998, apply sections 35AB and 35AC as if the application of those sections were not limited to the calculation of interest for 5 January 1998 and later days.

      * (3) In this section:

      * **_previous advance_**, in relation to a further advance in respect of a person, means an advance (whether a Corporation advance, initial advance, additional advance or further advance) in respect of which the person is or was a borrower, or a contract of sale, in respect of which the person is or was a purchaser, preceding the further advance in question. 

##### 35  Rate of interest on advances for essential repairs

##### 35AA  Interest rates reduced according to reduced Benchmark rate

      * (1) If the rate of interest payable for a particular month on a subsidised advance, or on an amount owed to the Bank in relation to a specified portfolio asset, exceeds the reduced Benchmark rate, the rate payable for that month is reduced to the level of the reduced Benchmark rate.

      * (2) The **_reduced Benchmark rate_** for the month is the Benchmark rate worked out for the month in accordance with subclause 11.10 of the Bank agreement or the corresponding provision of another agreement (whichever is applicable), rounded up or down to 2 decimal places (rounding 0.005% up), less 1.5 percentage points.

      * (3) This section applies despite anything in any certificate of entitlement or in any subsidised advance contract or portfolio mortgage, portfolio contract of sale, portfolio supplementary agreement or other portfolio agreement.

##### 35AB  Reduction of certain singletiered rates of interest

      * (1) If:

        * (a) a person is the borrower in respect of a subsidised advance or an amount owed to the Bank in relation to a specified portfolio asset; and

        * (b) apart from this section, a single rate of interest would be payable on the whole of the balance of the advance or amount; and

        * (c) that rate exceeds 6.85% per year;

      * the rate of interest payable on the balance is reduced to 6.85% per year.

      * (2) This section applies despite anything in any certificate of entitlement or in any subsidised advance contract or portfolio mortgage, portfolio contract of sale, portfolio supplementary agreement or other portfolio agreement.

      * (3) This section is subject to section 35AA (which will sometimes reduce the rate of interest payable to less than 6.85% per year).

##### 35AC  Replacement of multitiered rates of interest with single rate

      * (1) If:

        * (a) a person is the borrower in respect of a subsidised advance or an amount owed to the Bank in relation to a specified portfolio asset; and

        * (b) apart from this section, 2 or more different rates of interest would be payable on different parts of the balance of the advance or amount;

      * the following single rate of interest is instead taken to be payable on the balance: 

        * (c) if the blended interest rate (see subsection (2)) for the advance or amount is less than 4.5% per year--3.75% per year;

        * (d) if the blended interest rate is less than 6.85% per year but not less than 4.5% per year--4.5% per year;

        * (e) in any other case--6.85% per year.

      * (2) This is how to work out the **_blended interest rate_** for the advance or amount:

Method statement

          * Step 1.	For each different rate of interest payable, multiply the rate by that part of the limit of the advance, or of the limit of the amount, on which the rate is payable, and total the results.

             * Note: However, if that limit is nil, see subsection (4).

          * Step 2.	Divide the total by the limit of the advance or amount.

          * Step 3.	Express the result as a percentage rate per year and round the rate up or down to 2 decimal places (rounding 0.005% up). This is the **_blended interest rate_** for the advance or amount (subject to Steps 4 and 5).

          * Step 4.	If:

            * (a) the result from Step 3 is less than 6.85% per year but not less than 6.67% per year; and

            * (b) apart from this section, the different rates of interest payable on the different parts of the limit are 3.75% per year, 7.25% per year and 10% per year;

          * the **_blended interest rate_** is instead 6.85% per year.

          * Step 5.	If:

            * (a) the result from Step 3 is less than 4.5% per year but not less than 4.45% per year; and

            * (b) apart from this section, the different rates of interest payable on the different parts of the limit are 3.75% per year and 7.25% per year;

          * the **_blended interest rate_** is instead 4.5% per year.

             * Note: Steps 4 and 5 are needed because the amortisation of the limit of the advance or amount over the term of the loan or contract can cause small temporary deviations from the average of the various rates of interest over the term. Steps 4 and 5 prevent these deviations from affecting the calculation of the blended interest rate.

      * (3) This is an example of how to work out the **_blended interest rate_** for an advance or amount:

            * Example: Assume that the limit of an advance is $4,000. Interest is payable at the rates of 3.75% per year on the first $1,000, 7.25% per year on the next $1,000 and 10% per year on the last $2,000 of that limit.

            * The Step 1 calculations are: 

            * Under Step 2, the $310 is divided by the total limit of $4,000, giving a result of 0.0775.

            * Under Step 3, that result is expressed as a percentage: 7.75% per year.

            * Step 4 does not apply, because the blended interest rate is too high. Step 5 does not apply, because the blended interest rate is too high and in any event because the rates of interest in question are not the ones specified in Step 5. Therefore, the **_blended interest rate_** for the advance is 7.75% per year.

      * (4) For Steps 1 and 2 of the method statement in subsection (2), if the limit of the advance or amount at the time concerned is nil, then, instead of nil, use the amount of the limit from when the advance was first made, or when the amount first became owing to the Bank.

      * (5) This section applies despite anything in any certificate of entitlement or in any subsidised advance contract or portfolio mortgage, portfolio contract of sale, portfolio supplementary agreement or other portfolio agreement.

      * (6) This section is subject to section 35AA (which will sometimes further reduce the rate of interest payable).

      * (7) If this section would increase the total amount of interest payable on the balance of an advance or amount over the term of the advance or amount, then this section does not apply to that balance.

##### 35AD  Rates not altered for certain portfolio contracts of sale

      * Sections 35AA, 35AB and 35AC do not apply in relation to a portfolio contract of sale made as a result of the exercise of a power under section 36 of this Act as in force before the commencing day if, when the contract was made, the purchaser was not an eligible person within the meaning of this Act as then in force.

##### 35A  Modifications of Bank agreement and other instruments

      * (1) Despite clause 8.1 of the Bank agreement and anything contained in any subsidised advance contract or in any portfolio mortgage, portfolio contract of sale, portfolio supplementary agreement or other portfolio agreement:

        * (a) a subsidised advance or an amount owed to the Bank under a loan secured by a specified portfolio asset is repayable in equal monthly instalments comprising principal and interest; and

        * (b) interest on each subsidised advance and each amount owed under a loan secured by a specified portfolio asset is to be:

          * (i) charged in arrears; and

          * (ii) calculated by applying the applicable annual percentage rate divided by 365 to the outstanding daily balance of the subsidised advance loan account; and

        * (c) if the Commonwealth terminates the interest subsidy in respect of a subsidised advance contract:

          * (i) the Bank may terminate the contract and any associated portfolio mortgage, portfolio contract of sale, portfolio supplementary agreement or other portfolio agreement; and

          * (ii) if the Bank does so, it is entitled to demand repayment of, and recover by action in any court or under the mortgage, the principal and interest and any other money owing under the contract, mortgage or agreement.

      * (2) Clause 1.1 of the Bank agreement has effect as if the definition of "Rest Day" were omitted and the following definition were substituted:

      *  Rest Day: means, in respect of a Specified Portfolio Asset or a Subsidised Advance, the fifth day of each month on which principal and accrued interest will be due and payable in respect of the relevant Subsidised Advance Loan Account.

      * (3) Any reference to a rest day in any mortgage relating to a subsidised advance, or in any portfolio mortgage, portfolio contract of sale, portfolio supplementary agreement or other portfolio agreement, is taken to be a reference to a rest day as defined by subsection (2).

      * (4) The Bank agreement has effect as if Part B of Schedule D were omitted.

##### 36  Maximum terms of advances

      * (1) Subject to section 37, the maximum term to be specified under paragraph 17(3)(b) in a certificate of entitlement in relation to a subsidised advance that a person may seek from a credit provider is:

        * (a) in the case of an initial advance or of a home support advance--25 years;

        * (b) in the case of an additional advance, a widow or widower advance or an advance for essential repairs:

          * (i) a term equal to the unexpired part of the term of the borrower's initial advance, further advance or Corporation advance, or of the purchaser's contract of sale, as the case may be; or

          * (ii) if the Secretary determines that a longer maximum term would be appropriate, having regard to the circumstances of the case--such longer term as the Secretary determines;

        * (d) in the case of a further advance:

          * (i) if the person has ceased to be a purchaser or borrower in relation to the last preceding previous advance--a term equal to the unexpired part of the last preceding previous advance at the time immediately before the person ceased to be such a purchaser or borrower; or

          * (ii) in any other case--a term equal to the unexpired part of the last preceding previous advance; and

        * (e) in the case of an advance or a specified portfolio asset transferred to a transferee--a term equal to the unexpired part of the advance or asset so transferred.

      * (2) Subject to section 37, the maximum term of a specified portfolio asset which vests in the Bank under section 6B is a term equal to the remainder of the term of that specified portfolio asset as at the relevant vesting date.

      * (3) Where the term of a specified portfolio asset which vests in the Bank under section 6B, or of a subsidised advance increases as a result of a grant of instalment relief to the purchaser or borrower, the maximum term of that specified portfolio asset or advance shall be taken to have been increased by a period equal to the period by which the term of that asset or advance was so increased.

      * (4) In this section:

      * **_previous advance_**, in relation to a further advance in respect of a person, means an advance (whether a Corporation advance, initial advance, additional advance or further advance) in respect of which the person is or was a borrower, or a contract of sale, in respect of which the person is or was a purchaser, preceding the further advance in question.

##### 37  Conversion of contract of sale into mortgage

      * Where a purchaser executes a mortgage in favour of the Bank for the balance of the purchase money and interest, and all other money, payable under a contract of sale, the Bank shall be taken to have made, on the date of the mortgage, an initial advance to the purchaser under the agreement of an amount equal to the sum of the balance of the purchase money and all other money (including interest) payable under the contract as at that date, being an advance that is subject to the prescribed conditions and on which subsidy is payable by the Commonwealth.

### Part VI--Defence Service Homes Insurance Scheme

##### 38  Defence Service Homes Insurance Scheme

      * For the purposes of this Act, there shall be a Commonwealth insurance scheme, to be known as the **_Defence Service Homes Insurance Scheme_**, for the insurance of dwellinghouses, rights of residence in retirement villages, land, building materials and improvements of the kind referred to in section 38C and of houses, land, building materials and improvements of the kind mentioned in section 38CA.

    * 8.4	_Instalment Relief_

    * _The parties agree that where the Bank provides Instalment Relief, such relief will be granted by: 

       *  	(a) a reduction in the monthly instalments of the Borrower under the Specified Portfolio Asset or Subsidised Advance and an extension in the repayment term of that Specified Portfolio Asset or Subsidised Advance to cover the cost of such reduction, thereby extending the period over which the Commonwealth pays Subsidy to the Bank; and

       * (b) the incorporation in the Limit of the Subsidised Advance Loan Account applicable to the Specified Portfolio Asset or Subsidised Advance of;

          * (i) part or all of the amount of Arrears outstanding in that Subsidised Advance Loan Account at the date of effect of the Instalment Relief; and

          * (ii) unpaid interest where agreed instalments are reduced as a result of the grant of Instalment Relief.

    * _In the event that the Certificate of Entitlement states that the Commonwealth consents to a Transfer of Land and Subsidy and the Bank consents to such transfer after application of the lending criteria set out in Schedule "C" then the Commonwealth shall continue to pay Subsidy in accordance with the terms of this Agreement. 

    * 8.6	_Fees_

    * _The Bank agrees that an Entitled Applicant and/or Borrower will pay no other fees and no more in fees with respect to all applications for Subsidised Advances, Instalment Relief and consents to Transfer of Land and Subsidy to the Bank than its other Housing Loan Customers. Nothing herein prevents the Bank from charging an Entitled Applicant less than the fees paid by its other Housing Loan Customers. 

    * 8.7	_Failure to meet lending criteria_

    * _In the event that a Certificate of Entitlement indicates that:

       * (i) a Subsidised Advance is to be a widow's advance;

       * (ii) a Subsidised Avance is to be made for essential repairs; or

       * (iii) Instalment Relief is to be granted, 

    * and the Entitled Applicant fails to meet the lending criteria set out in Schedule "C", the Bank agrees:

      * (a) that the Bank shall provide to the Commonwealth its reasons in writing as to why the Entitled Applicant has failed to meet the lending criteria set out in Schedule "C"; and

    * 8.8	_Further Loans/Instalment Relief_

    * _Nothing hereunder shall operate in any way to restrict the ability of a Borrower to approach the Bank for such further loans and/or instalment relief as the Borrower may in his discretion require, in which event the Bank hereby undertakes to treat such loan and/or instalment relief applications in their ordinary and usual course of banking business and treat the Borrower as it would treat a Housing Loan Customer seeking a single loan. In particular, the Bank agrees that where a Borrower applies for another loan at the same time as applying for a Subsidised Advance it will charge the Borrower one set of Establishment Fees covering both the Subsidised Advance and the further loan and secure both advances under the same first mortgage.

    * 9. 	EXCESS CREDITS

    * _The Bank agrees to provide to a Borrower a choice between the two types of Excess Credit arrangement referred to in Subclause 9.2. In the event that the Borrower fails to exercise such a choice before the Borrower's first repayment is due to the Bank under the Portfolio Asset and/or Subsidised Advance, then the Bank shall provide a loan interest offset arrangement. The Bank further agrees that a Borrower may elect at any time to change between the two types of Excess Credit arrangements during the currency of the Portfolio Asset and/or Subsidised Advance. 

    * 9.4	_Loan Interest Offset Arrangement_

    * _If the Bank provides a loan interest offset arrangement then:

       * 9.4.1	the Bank will apply the Excess Credits to reduce the principal outstanding in the Borrower's Subsidised Advance Loan Account without penalty to the Borrower;

       * 9.4.2	where the principal outstanding attracts various interest rates the reduction shall be made on a proportionate basis in accordance with the relationship between the amount of principal which attracts a single interest rate and the total principal outstanding;

       * 9.4.3	providing it remains secured by the first mortgage the Borrower may increase the principal outstanding by drawing from his Subsidised Advance Loan Account any amount by which the Limit exceeds the Balance;

       * 9.4.4	the Bank will permit the Borrower to withdraw funds at any time by way of cheque; and

       * 9.4.5	the Bank will permit four (4) free withdrawals or debits for each quarter of each Calendar Year.

    * 9.5	_Banking Account_

    * _If the Bank provides a banking account then:

    * 9.7	_Prepayments_

    * _In the event that the Borrower pays to the Bank an amount in excess of that required to meet the monthly instalment on the Specified Portfolio Asset and/or Subsidised Advance, and the Borrower specifically elects for that amount to be treated as a prepayment then the Bank shall treat that amount as a prepayment. Such prepayments are to be applied by the Bank at the direction of the Borrower to reducing the principal and interest outstanding under the Borrower's Specified Portfolio Asset and/or Subsidised Advance without penalty to the Borrower. 

    * 9.8	_Effect of prepayment_

    * _The Bank agrees that where a Borrower has made the election referred to in Subclause 9.7 the prepayment will not affect the monthly instalments payable by the Borrower, but shall reduce the term applicable to the Specified Portfolio Asset and/or Subsidised Advance. 

    * 9.9	_Prepayment on a loan_

    * _In the event that the Borrower makes a prepayment on a loan account applicable to his Specified Portfolio Asset and/or Subsidised Advance which has more than one interest rate then the Bank shall credit that prepayment on a proportionate basis in accordance with the relationship between the amount of principal which attracts a single interest rate and the total principal outstanding.

    * 10.1	_Obligations of Bank to notify the Commonwealth_

    * _The Bank shall notify the Comonwealth when the Bank Manager responsible for a Borrower's account becomes aware of or receives in the ordinary course of banking business any of the following concerning or regarding an Entitled Applicant or Borrower, such notification to be forwarded to the Commonwealth not more than seven (7) days after the Bank Manager becomes aware of or receives same:

      *  	(a) the amount of Subsidy shall be equal to the difference between the actual amount of interest payable in that month by a Borrower on the Balance outstanding on any Subsidised Advance Loan Account and the notional amount of interest calculated by applying to the same Balance the Benchmark rate of interest determined at the end of the previous month pursuant to Subclause 11.10;

      * (b) in the event that the total amount of Portfolio Arrears exceeds 0.035 per cent of the aggregate of the Limits on all Subsidised Advance Loan Accounts, the total Subsidy payable pursuant to this Clause shall be reduced by an amount calculated by application of the following formula:

      * where

        * X = the amount by which the Subsidy is to be reduced;

        * Y = the total Subsidy calculated in accordance with Subclause 11.9(a); 

        * a = the amount by which Portfolio Arrears exceed 0.035 per cent of the aggregate of the Limits on all Subsidised Advance Loan Accounts; and

        * b = the aggregate of the Balances of all Subsidised Advance Loan Accounts.

    * 11.10	_Calculation of Benchmark Rate_

    * _The Benchmark rate, being the maximum notional rate of interest to which the Bank is entitled in respect of the outstanding principal under all Specified Portfolio Assets and/or Subsidised Advances for the purpose of calculating payments of Subsidy to the Bank by the Commonwealth, shall be calculated in the manner provided in Subclause 11.10.7 or, if applicable, Subclause 11.10.8, by reference to the unregulated standard annual rates of interest applied in each State and the Australian Capital Territory and the Northern Territory to the first $25,000 (or such other amount as may be agreed by the Commonwealth and the Bank) of owneroccupied housing loans provided by the five (5) largest banking group providers of housing finance in Australia.

        * 11.10.1	For the purposes of Subclause 11.10, the unregulated standard annual rates of interest applied to owneroccupied housing loans shall be the rate which is applied to the largest number of owneroccupied housing loans outstanding in each State and the Australian Capital Territory and the Northern Territory to each of the banking groups concerned, as determined by reference to data compiled by the Reserve Bank of Australia or as the parties may otherwise agree.

        * 11.10.2	The five (5) largest banking group providers of housing finance in Australia for the purposes of this Subclause shall be determined as at 1 July in each Financial Year that Subsidy is payable on the basis of data published by the Australian Bureau of Statistics or, if such information is not available, as may otherwise be agreed between the parties.

        * 11.10.3	In the event that the parties are unable to agree on:

          * (a) the unregulated standard annual rates of interest applied to owneroccupied housing loans in each State and the Australian Capital Territory and the Northern Territory under Subclause 11.10.1; or

          * (b) the five (5) largest banking group providers of housing finance in Australia under Subclause 11.10.2;

        * within fourteen (14) days of first notification by either party to the other of that disagreement, the matter in dispute shall be determined by an independent nominee of the President of the Institute of Chartered Accountants of Australia. Such determination shall be conclusive and binding on both parties. The fees and expenses of the nominee shall be borne equally by the parties.

        * 11.10.4	Pending the resolution of any dispute or disagreement referred to in Subclause 11.10.3 in the manner provided for in that Subclause, the Benchmark rate used to calculate the Subsidy payable to the Bank by the Commonwealth in the immediately preceding month shall continue to apply. 

        * 11.10.5	Upon resolution of such dispute or disagreement, the amount of Subsidy next payable to the Bank by the Commonwealth after such resolution takes place, or if insufficient time is available, the payment after the next payment, shall be adjusted to take into account the result of that resolution.

        * 11.10.6	The Commonwealth and the Bank agree that the amount of such adjustment shall bear interest at the Benchmark rate fixed in accordance with Subclause 11.10.

        * 11.10.7	Subject to Subclause 11.10.8, the Benchmark rate to be used for Subsidy payment purposes in any month shall be calculated monthly in two stages as follows:

          * (a) for each banking group concerned, a simple arithmetic average of the unregulated standard annual rates of interest for owneroccupied housing loans as defined in Subclause 11.10.1 which that banking group applied on the last day of the immediately preceding month in each State and the Australian Capital Territory and the Northern Territory in which the banking group concerned conducted housing loan business shall be calculated; and

          * (b) the figures calculated for each banking group under Subclause 11.10.7(a) shall then be subject to a simple arithmetic average to determine the Benchmark rate for that month.

        * 11.10.8	In the event that the Bank should, in future, for any reason, offer publicly to make loans for the purchase or construction of owneroccupied houses in any State or Territory on terms including that the first interest rate to be applied is lower than the Benchmark rate determined in accordance with Subclause 11.10.7, then the Subsidy payable to the Bank by the Commonwealth in respect of each Subsidised Advance provided by the Bank to an Entitled Applicant in the relevant State or Territory during the period in which such publicly announced loans are available, shall be determined by reference to that lower rate for a period equal to the period during which that lower rate applies to such publicly announced loans. Thereafter the normal Benchmark rate shall apply.

    * 11.11	_Bank Providers of Housing Finance_

    * _The Bank and the Commonwealth hereby agree that for the purposes of this Agreement until 1 July 1989 the five (5) largest banking group providers of housing finance in Australia shall be:

    * _In the event that the Benchmark rate of interest prescribed in Subclause 11.10 falls below the actual rate of interest payable by a Borrower in respect of a Specified Portfolio Asset and/or Subsidised Advance, the Bank agrees to pay to the Commonwealth, on a monthly basis, an amount to be calculated as follows:

    * Such amount shall be equal to the difference between the notional amount of interest payable in that month by a Borrower on the Balance outstanding on any Subsidised Advance Loan Account at the end of the preceding month, calculated by applying the Benchmark rate of interest to that Balance and the amount of interest payable in that same month by the Borrower calculated by applying to the same Balance the actual rate(s) of interest prescribed under the terms and conditions governing that Subsidised Advance Loan Account.

    * 11.13	_Deduction from Subsidy Payments_

    * _Any amount payable by the Bank pursuant to Subclause 11.12 shall be deducted from the Bank's claim for Subsidy provided pursuant to Subclause 11.4. In the event that such deductions exceed the total sum of Subsidy calculated in accordance with Subclause 11.9 then any net sum payable by the Bank to the Commonwealth shall be paid fifteen (15) days after the relevant Rest Day.

    * 11.14	_Where Benchmark Rate falls below 6.85 per cent_

    * _In the event that the Benchmark rate of interest prescribed in Subclause 11.10 falls below 6.85 per cent or such other rate as may be specified in the Amended Act for inclusion in Certificates of Entitlement for initial advances and is likely in the opinion of either the Bank or the Commonwealth to continue below such rate in the future then the parties shall meet forthwith for the purpose of reviewing the situation.

        * (ii) is discovered not to have been entitled to a Certificate of Entitlement, a Portfolio Contract of Sale or a Specified Portfolio Asset at the time when the Certificate of Entitlement was issued to the Borrower or the Corporation Advance secured by the Specified Portfolio Asset was received by the Borrower or the Portfolio Contract of Sale was executed by the Borrower;

        * (iii) purports to transfer a holding without a Certificate of Entitlement having been issued which provides for Commonwealth consent to the Transfer of Land and Subsidy to the proposed transferee;

        * (iv) is discovered to have used the Subsidised Advance or Corporation Advance for a purpose other than that for which it was made;

        * (v) is a transferee of a holding in respect of which the Commonwealth has issued a Certificate of Entitlement consenting to a Transfer of Land and Subsidy and has without reasonable excuse failed to comply with an undertaking given by that transferee under Subsection 22(2) of the Amended Act; or

        * (vi) becomes the husband or wife of another Borrower,

      * (b) where the Bank takes action to enforce a Portfolio Contract of Sale or a security for which the Subsidised Advance or a Corporation Advance was provided and the Bank has not within three (3) months sold the property and discharged the loan outstanding to it thereon; or

      * (c) where, without the prior written consent of the Commonwealth, a Borrower having a Subsidised Advance seeks to use that Subsidised Advance for the purpose of discharging any existing mortgage or other security over that Borrower's land or land and dwelling house.

    * 11.16	_Notice of termination of Subsidy payments to Bank _

    * _Where the Commonwealth elects to terminate future Subsidy payments to the Bank in respect of a Specified Portfolio Asset pursuant to Subclause 11.15(a) then it shall give the Bank one month's notice of its intention to do so. If prior to the completion of that one month period the Bank gives the Commonwealth notice that it intends to take action to enforce its security with respect to that Specified Portfolio Asset then the Commonwealth shall continue to pay Subsidy until the Bank has discharged its loan, or for three (3) months, whichever is the earlier. Any Subsidy paid to the Bank which is recoverable from the Borrower pursuant to the Amending Act shall be paid to the Commonwealth by the Bank as required by the Amending Act from any moneys due to the Borrower from the proceeds of any sale by the Bank of his land or land and dwelling house.

    * 11.17	_Entitlement of Bank to charge applicable interest rate _

    * _The Commonwealth acknowledges that it shall be a term of any Subsidised Advance made by the Bank to a Borrower that in the event that Subsidy is, for any reason whatsoever, terminated by the Commonwealth in respect of that advance, the Bank shall be entitled to charge the interest rate applicable to similar loans provided by the Bank to borrowers generally from the date of termination of Subsidy.

       * 12.1.1	Where following such notice the Bank fails to rectify such persistent failure then without prejudice to any other rights the Commonwealth may have:

         * (b) in the event that the persistent failure continues for a period of three (3) months or more following the Bank's receipt of notice thereof from the Commonwealth, the Bank is required to show cause to the Commonwealth why the Commonwealth should not terminate the Bank's exclusive right to make future Subsidised Advances to Entitled Applicants under the Amended Act and grant that right, together with the associated right to receipt of Subsidy in respect of such future Subsidised Advances, to another person of the Commonwealth's sole choosing and, in the event that the Bank fails to do so, the Commonwealth and the Bank agree that the Commonwealth may terminate the Bank's exclusive right to make future Subsidised Advances to Entitled Applicants under the Amended Act and grant that right together with the associated right to receipt of Subsidy thereon to another person of the Commonwealth's sole choosing.
