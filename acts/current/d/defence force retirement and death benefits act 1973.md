      * (ii) any amount or amounts required, under subsection 69(1B) or 69(3A) of the previous Act, to be paid by the person to the Defence Forces Retirement Benefits Fund established under the previous Act;

     * in respect of that commutation;

    * exceeds the amount per annum of the retirement pay to which the person was or will be entitled on retirement multiplied by the maximum commutation factor.

       * Note: This amount is reduced if a release authority lump sum has been paid: see section 49M.

    * (2B) For the purposes of subsection (2A), the maximum commutation factor is the number calculated in accordance with the formula:

    * where **_A_** is:

     * (a) if the number (treating zero as a number) of whole periods of 12 months between 30 June 1982 and the date of retirement of the recipient member is less than 20--that number of periods; or

     * (b) in any other case--20.

    * (3) Where a person makes an election under this section, then, subject to subsections (8) and (9):

     * (a) there shall be paid to him by the Commonwealth an amount equal to the amount specified in the election as the amount that is to be payable to him by virtue of the commutation; and

     * (b) the amount per annum of the retirement pay payable to him, on and after the day on which the election takes effect, is the amount per annum that, but for this paragraph and subsection 98K(1), would be payable reduced by an amount calculated by dividing the amount referred to in paragraph (a) by the expectation of life factor that, having regard to the age and sex of the person on the day on which the election takes effect, is applicable to him under Schedule 3.

    * (4) For the purposes of this section, an election shall be deemed to have been made, and shall take effect, on the day on which the notice of election is received by CSC or the day following the day on which the person retires, whichever is the later.

    * (5) Where:

     * (a) a person becomes entitled to retirement pay under subsection 23(1); and

     * (b) the person had on a previous occasion become entitled to retirement pay under that section; and

     * (c) on that occasion the person had made an election under subsection (1) of this section (in this section called the **_previous election_**) to commute a portion of his or her retirement pay; and

     * (d) the person's retirement pay was subsequently cancelled under subsection 62(1) on his or her again becoming an eligible member of the Defence Force;

    * then, subject to subsection (7), subsection (3) applies to the person as if:

     * (e) the person:

      * (i) were entitled to make an election under subsection (1) to commute a portion of his or her retirement pay; and

      * (ii) has made the election on the day immediately following the day on which the person retired; and

     * (f) the election specified the amount prescribed by subsection (6) as the amount that is to be payable to the person because of the commutation.

    * (6) For the purposes of paragraph (5)(f), the prescribed amount is:

     * (a) if the previous election made by the person had specified the maximum amount (in this subsection called the **_previous maximum amount_**) that could have been specified in that election in accordance with subsection (2A)--an amount equal to the maximum amount (in this subsection called the **_putative maximum amount_**) that the person could (under subsection (2A)) specify in an election made under subsection (1) if the person were entitled to make the election on his or her becoming entitled to the retirement pay; or

     * (b) if the previous election made by the person had specified a lesser amount than the previous maximum amount--an amount calculated by using the formula:

    * (7) Where, because of subsection (5), subsection (3) applies to a person (in this subsection called the **_recipient member_**), there must be deducted from the amount that, apart from this subsection, would be payable to the recipient member under paragraph (3)(a) an amount equal to the sum of:

     * (a) the amount that was paid to the recipient member under that paragraph as a result of the previous election made by him or her; and

     * (b) any increase in that amount that the recipient member would have received if, on each occasion after the payment of the amount on which a person to whom a pension benefit was payable was entitled under section 98B to an increase in the rate of that pension benefit, the recipient member had been entitled to an increase in that amount calculated under that section in the same way as the increase in the rate of pension benefit was calculated.

    * (8) If:

     * (a) a member of the scheme makes an election under this section (**_first election_**); and

     * (b) the member's surcharge debt account is in debit when retirement pay becomes payable to the member; and

     * (c) the member also makes an election under subsection 124(1);

    * the following provisions apply:

      * (i) the member's surcharge deduction amount; or

      * (ii) if the member's surcharge deduction amount exceeds the specified amount--so much of the surcharge deduction amount as does not exceed the specified amount;

      * (ii) if the member's surcharge deduction amount exceeds the specified amount--the amount per annum worked out by using the formula:

      * where: 

      * **_basic rate_** means the amount per annum referred to in paragraph (3)(b).

      * **_conversion factor_** is the factor that is applicable to the member under the determination made by CSC under section 124A.

##### 25  Rate of retirement pay applicable to certain existing contributors

    * (1) In this section:

    * **_new pension percentage of pay_**, in relation to a person to whom this section applies, means the annual rate of his retirement pay (expressed as a percentage of the rate that was his annual rate of pay for the purposes of this Act immediately before his retirement) that is, or, but for an election under this section, would be, payable to him under this Act on his retirement.

    * **_previous pension percentage of pay_**, in relation to a person to whom this section applies, means the annual rate of pension (expressed as a percentage of the rate that was his annual rate of pay, for the purposes of the previous Act, on 30 September 1972) that would have been payable to him under the previous legislation if he had retired on 30 September 1972, otherwise than on the ground of invalidity or of physical or mental incapacity to perform his duties, and:

     * (a) being an existing contributor referred to in subparagraph (2)(d)(i):

      * (i) in the case of a person who was, on 30 September 1972, an officer of the Permanent Forces--he had, on that date, attained the retiring age for the rank held by him on that date; or

      * (ii) in the case of a person who was, on that date, a nonPermanent Forces officer as defined in section 54A of the previous Act--he had, on that date:

        * (A) retired with the rank held by him on that date; and

        * (B) reached the age that was his age on the date of his retirement;

     * and had, on 30 September 1972, completed a number of years of service for pension equal to the number of years of service for pension completed by him on his retirement; or

     * (b) being a person referred to in subparagraph (2)(d)(ii)--he had, on 30 September 1972, reached the age that was his age on the date of his retirement.

    * **_retiring age for the rank held_** has the same meaning as it would have in the definition of **_retiring age for the rank held_** in subsection 4(1) of the previous Act if the reference in that definition to the date of a member's retirement were a reference to 30 September 1972.

    * **_service for pension_** means service for pension as defined by subsection 4(1) of the previous Act.

    * (2) This section applies to a person who:

     * (a) is an existing contributor;

     * (b) retires and, on his retirement, is entitled to retirement pay;

     * (c) was, on 30 September 1972 and, immediately before his retirement, an officer; and

     * (d) is a person:

      * (i) who, on his retirement, had attained the retiring age for the rank held by him on 30 September 1972 and had completed not less than 15 years' service for pension; or

      * (ii) who, on his retirement, had not attained the retiring age for the rank held by him on 30 September 1972 but in respect of whom CSC is satisfied that, but for the enactment of this Act and the _Defence Forces Retirement Benefits Act 1973_, paragraph 39(2)(b) or (c) of the previous Act would, on his retirement, have applied.

    * (2AA) For the purposes of subparagraph (2)(d)(ii):

     * (a) a reference in subparagraph 39(2)(b)(ii) or (2)(c)(ii) of the previous Act to the rank held by an officer shall be read as a reference to the rank held by the officer on
     * 30 September 1972;


     * (b) the reference in subparagraph 39(2)(c)(i) of the previous Act to the rank of an officer at the date of his retirement shall be read as a reference to the rank of the officer on
     * 30 September 1972; and


     * (c) a reference in subparagraph 39(2)(b)(ii) or (2)(c)(ii) of the previous Act to the retiring age for the rank held shall be read as a reference to the retiring age for the rank held within the meaning of this section.

    * (2A) Where a person to whom this section applies has made an election under section 44 of the _Defence Forces Retirement Benefits Act 1959_, section 28 of the _Defence Forces Retirement Benefits Act 1962 _or section 38, 61A or 61B of the _Defence Forces Retirement Benefits Act 1963_, this section has effect as if the previous pension percentage of pay in relation to that person were a percentage that would have been the previous pension percentage of pay in relation to him if he had not made that election and had paid all the contributions which he would, but for that election, have been required to pay under the previous legislation.

    * (3) Where the previous pension percentage of pay applicable to a person to whom this section applies is greater than the new pension percentage of pay applicable to him, he may, by notice in writing given to CSC within a period of 90 days after the date of his retirement, or within such further period as CSC, in special circumstances, allows, elect that the rate at which retirement pay shall be payable to him shall be an amount per annum that is such percentage of his annual rate of pay for the purposes of this Act immediately before his retirement as is the same as the previous pension percentage of pay applicable to him, and, subject to subsection (4), the election has effect accordingly.

    * (4) Where CSC so determines, an election under subsection (3) is of no effect unless the person making the election pays to the Commonwealth a contribution under this section of such amount as CSC determines as being appropriate in the circumstances or arrangements satisfactory to CSC are made for the payment of that contribution to the Commonwealth.

    * (5) In the application of this section to a person who was, on 30 September 1972, a nonPermanent Forces officer as defined by section 54A of the previous Act, the retiring age for the rank held shall be the age that would be deemed, for the purposes referred to in subsection 54A(2) of that Act, to be the retiring age for the rank held by the person on his retirement if he had retired on 30 September 1972.

##### 30  Classification in respect of incapacity

    * (1) Where a member of the scheme, not being a member of the scheme to whom section 36 applies, is, or is about to become, entitled to invalidity benefit, CSC shall determine his percentage of incapacity in relation to civil employment and shall classify him according to the percentage of incapacity as follows:

    * (1A) Where:

     * (c) determine what was, immediately before the member's death, his or her percentage of incapacity in relation to civil employment; and

     * (d) classify the member under subsection (1) according to that percentage of incapacity, as if the member had not died.

     * (a) the vocational, trade and professional skills, qualifications and experience of the member;

     * (b) the kinds of civil employment which a person with the skills, qualifications and experience referred to in paragraph (a) might reasonably undertake;

    * (3) Where the previous pension percentage of pay applicable to a person to whom this section applies, being a person who on his retirement, is classified as Class B or Class C under section 30, is greater than the new pension percentage of pay applicable to him, he may, by notice in writing given to CSC within a period of 90 days after the date of his retirement, or within such further period as CSC, in special circumstances, allows, elect that the rate at which invalidity pay shall be payable to him shall be an amount per annum that is such percentage of his annual rate of pay for the purposes of this Act immediately before his retirement as is the same as the previous pension percentage of pay applicable to him, and, subject to subsection (5), the election has effect accordingly.

#### Division 2--Benefits for nonmember spouse

##### 49B  Associate pension for nonmember spouse if operative time in payment phase

    * (1) This section applies to a superannuation interest (the **_original interest_****) **if:

     * (a) CSC receives a splitting agreement or splitting order in respect of the original interest; and

       * Note: If the member spouse dies before becoming entitled to standard pension, then subsection (1) will nevertheless result in an indirect reduction of any widow's pension or spouse pension that becomes payable. This happens because the amount of the widow's pension or spouse pension is based on the amount of invalidity pay (a standard pension) that would have become payable to the member spouse at the time of death.

    * (2) A reduction under subsection (1) is to be disregarded in calculating the amount of any nonstandard pension that later becomes payable.

    * then the annual rate of the later pension is reduced to the amount calculated under the Orders.

    * (1B) If:

     * (a) the annual rate of a standard pension payable to the member spouse is reduced under subsection (1); and

     * (b) after the operative time, a lump sum amount becomes payable, in respect of the member spouse, under section 32, 48, 48A, 56, 57 or 77;

    * then the lump sum amount is reduced to the amount calculated under the Orders.

    * (2) A reduction under this section is to be disregarded in calculating the amount of any nonstandard pension that later becomes payable.

       * Note: For example, the reduction will be disregarded in calculating the amount of pension under section 42 payable to a child of the member spouse after the member spouse's death.

    * (2) The release authority lump sum is to be paid before an amount is paid to the person by virtue of a commutation under section 24 or 32A.

    * (3) To avoid doubt, the person's retirement pay or invalidity pay is to be reduced under this Part to reflect the release authority lump sum, and the following are to be worked out having regard to that reduced amount of retirement pay or invalidity pay:

     * (a) the amount that may be paid by virtue of the commutation;

     * (b) the retirement pay or invalidity pay payable after the commutation takes effect.

     * (a) a reference, in relation to a contributing member, to a transfer value payable to or in respect of the member under a superannuation scheme applicable in relation to any employment in which he was employed at any time before the date on which he became an eligible member of the Defence Force is a reference to a benefit by way of a lump sum payable to or in respect of the member under that scheme upon the termination of the employment otherwise than on the ground of invalidity or of physical or mental incapacity to perform the duties of the employment, being a benefit that was based wholly upon contributions under that scheme by the employer or was based partly upon such contributions and partly upon contributions under the scheme by the member; and

     * (b) a reference to the amount of a transfer value to which paragraph (a) applies does not include a reference to any part of the lump sum that was based upon contributions by the member that were of a similar nature to contributions under the _Superannuation Act 1922_, or that Act as amended and in force from time to time, for reserve units of pension or to supplementary contributions under the Superannuation Act.

    * (2) If, after a transfer value became payable to or in respect of a person under a superannuation scheme, an amount equal to the whole or any part of that transfer value was paid to a person administering another superannuation scheme (not being the benefits scheme constituted by this Act):

     * (a) where the whole of the transfer value was so paid--that transfer value shall be disregarded for the purposes of this Division; or

    * (3) Subject to subsection (4), a transfer value shall be deemed, for the purposes of this Division, to have become payable in respect of a person under a superannuation scheme upon the termination of any employment if, upon the termination of that employment, the person was the owner of a life policy, or was entitled to have the rights of the owner of a life policy assigned to him or her, being a policy the premiums for which were, while the person was employed in that employment, paid in whole or in part by the person's employer, and, in that case, the surrender value of the policy as at the date of the termination of the employment shall be taken to be the amount of the transfer value.

    * (4) Where a transfer value is, by virtue of subsection (3), to be deemed, for the purposes of this Division, to have become payable in respect of a person upon the termination of any employment by reason that, upon the termination of that employment, the person was the owner of a life policy, or was entitled to have the rights of the owner of a life policy assigned to him or her, a transfer value shall not be deemed, for those purposes, to have become payable in respect of the person upon the termination of any previous employment by reason that, upon the termination of that previous employment, the person was the owner of that policy, or was entitled to have the rights of the owner of that policy assigned to him or her.

##### 69  Members who pay transfer values to Commonwealth

     * (a) the member, by notice in writing given to CSC within a period of 90 days after the date on which he becomes a contributing member, or within such further period as CSC, in special circumstances, allows, elects to pay to the Commonwealth an amount equal to the amount of that transfer value or, if 2 or more transfer values became payable, the sum of the amounts of those transfer values; and

     * (b) that amount is, before the expiration of that period of
     * 90 days or that further period, as the case may be, paid to the Commonwealth;

    * (3) The total period of effective service of a contributing member referred to in subsection (1) of this section, or of a contributing member in respect of whom a transfer value was paid to the Board under section 82R of the previous Act, shall be deemed to be increased by such period as is determined by CSC, having regard to such matters as are prescribed for the purposes of this section, as being appropriate.

    * (4) If:

     * (a) under the superannuation scheme applicable in relation to any previous employment of the person, the whole or any part of the employer component of a transfer value was payable to the contributing member upon the termination of that employment irrespective of whether he engaged in further employment; and

     * (b) the contributing member ceases to be an eligible member of the Defence Force and benefit is payable to him under subsection 32(2) or under section 48 or 56;

    * so much of the amount paid to the Commonwealth under subsection (1) as is equal to the employer component of the transfer value or to that part of that employer component, as the case may be, is payable to or in respect of him.

    * (5) For the purposes of this section:

     * (a) the employee component of a transfer value payable to or in respect of a person is the part (if any) of that transfer value that was based upon contributions made by the person; and

     * (a) in the case of a person other than a person in relation to whom paragraph (b) applies--the period of 90 days immediately after he ceased to be an eligible member of the Defence Force; or

     * (b) in the case of a person who ceased to be an eligible member of the Defence Force by reason of his having been transferred to a Reserve or discharged from the Defence Force, or having had his continuous fulltime service terminated, under the Defence (Parliamentary Candidates) Act for the purpose of enabling him to become a candidate for election as a member of a House of the Parliament of Australia or of a State or of the Legislative Assembly of the Northern Territory or a legislative or advisory body for another Territory prescribed for the purposes of section 7 of the _Defence (Parliamentary Candidates) Act 19691974 _and was a candidate at the election:

    * (3) Where invalidity pay was not payable to a person under this Act during any period by reason only of section 35, or a pension, being invalidity benefit, was not payable to a person under the previous Act during any period by reason only of section 53A or section 53B of the previous Act, that period shall be treated for the purposes of this Division as if it had been a period during which that invalidity pay or pension, as the case may be, was payable but:

     * (a) if the person was, immediately before the invalidity pay or the pension, as the case may be, became payable, a contributing member for the purposes of this Act or a contributor under the previous Act--shall not, in the calculation of the period during which he was employed in eligible employment, be treated as if it had been a period of effective service in relation to him under this Act; or

     * (b) if the person was, immediately before the invalidity pay or the pension, as the case may be, became payable, employed in public employment--shall not, in the calculation of the period during which he was employed in public employment, be treated as if it had been a period during which he was employed in public employment.

##### 98D  Adjustment of increase in case of certain pension benefits

    * (1) Where a person to whom pension benefit has become payable (whether or not it has become payable to the person by virtue of section 78) would, but for this section, be entitled to an increase in the rate at which the pension benefit was payable to the person immediately before the commencement of the prescribed halfyear and:

     * (a) if the pension benefit became payable to the person otherwise than as a spouse or as an eligible child--the pension benefit became payable to the person during the halfyear (in this section referred to as the **_preceding halfyear_**) immediately preceding the prescribed halfyear;

     * (b) if the pension benefit became payable to the person as the spouse of a member of the scheme and pension benefit in accordance with that section was not payable to the member immediately before his death--the pension benefit became payable to the spouse during the preceding halfyear;

     * (c) if the pension benefit became payable to the person as the spouse of a member of the scheme and pension benefit was payable to the member immediately preceding his death--the member's pension benefit became payable during the halfyear;

     * (e) if the pension benefit became payable to the person as an eligible child and pension benefit was payable to a member of the scheme in relation to whom the person is an eligible child--the member's pension benefit became payable during the preceding halfyear;

    * this section applies to the firstmentioned pension benefit.

    * (2) Where a pension benefit is, under section 43A or 44, payable to a person immediately before the commencement of a prescribed halfyear:

     * (a) in a case where the pension benefit became so payable by virtue of the retirement and death, during the preceding halfyear, of a member of the scheme who was, at the time of his death, a recipient member--this section applies to the pension benefit as if it were a pension benefit payable to the person otherwise than as a spouse or as an eligible child from the day following the date of retirement of the member of the scheme;

     * (b) in a case where the pension benefit became so payable by virtue of the death, during the preceding halfyear, of a member of the scheme who was, at the time of his death, a contributing member--this section applies to the pension benefit as if it were a pension benefit payable to the person otherwise than as a spouse or as an eligible child from the day following the date of death of the member of the scheme; or

     * (c) in any other case--this section does not apply to the pension benefit.

    * (3) If:

     * (a) the pension benefit;

     * (b) where paragraph (1)(c) applies--the pension benefit that was payable to the member of the scheme in relation to whom the person is a spouse; or

     * (b) where paragraph (1)(c) applies--the pension benefit that was payable to the member of the scheme in relation to whom the person is a spouse; or

     * (c) where paragraph (1)(e) applies--the pension benefit that was payable to the member of the scheme in relation to whom the person was an eligible child;

    * became payable on or before 16 June or 16 December (as the case requires) in the preceding halfyear, the amount of the increase is so much only of the amount that, but for this section, would have been the amount of the increase as bears to that lastmentioned amount the same proportion as the number of months in the period that commenced on the day on which the pension benefit referred to in paragraph (a), (b) or (c) became payable and ended on 30 June or 31 December (as the case requires) in the preceding halfyear bears to 6.

    * (5) If the period referred to in subsection (4) is less than 1 month, that period shall be treated as 1 month.

    * (6) If the period referred to in subsection (4) consists of a number of whole months and a part of a month:

##### 98F  Rate of invalidity pay payable on reclassification during a prescribed halfyear

    * (1) Where:

     * (a) a person to whom pension benefit, being invalidity pay, is payable, is reclassified under section 34 during a prescribed halfyear; and

     * (b) the person became entitled at the commencement of that halfyear to an increase under this Part in the rate at which the pension benefit was payable to him immediately before the commencement of that halfyear;

    * the rate at which the pension benefit is payable to him on and after the date from which the reclassification has effect is the rate at which the pension benefit would have been payable to him at the commencement of that halfyear if his classification, on and after the date on which he became entitled to the pension benefit, had been in accordance with the reclassification.

    * (3) Where:

     * (a) at the commencement of a prescribed halfyear, a member of the scheme entitled to invalidity benefit was classified as Class C under section 30 (whether on retirement or because of a reclassification under section 34) but was not entitled to invalidity pay; and

     * (b) during the prescribed halfyear the member is reclassified as Class A or Class B;

    * the rate at which pension benefit, being invalidity pay, is payable to the member on or after the day from which the reclassification has effect is the rate at which the benefit would be payable to the member on that day if, at all times during the period during which the member was classified as Class C, the member had been classified as Class A or Class B (as the case may be).

##### 98G  Commutation of pension benefits during a prescribed halfyear

     * (c) he had commuted that portion of his pension benefit on the date on which he became entitled to the pension benefit; and

     * (d) he had attained, on the date on which he became entitled to the pension benefit, the age that is his age on the date of commutation.

#### Division 3--Increase for pensioners aged 55 or older

##### 98GA  Simplified outline of this Division

    * For pensioners aged 55 or older, indexation is based on the more favourable of positive movements in:

      * (a) the consumer price index (CPI); and

      * (b) the pensioner and beneficiary living cost index (LCI);

    * with an adjustment if needed to ensure that affected pension benefits are increased by at least the percentage required to maintain a hypothetical pension at 27.7% of male total average weekly earnings (MTAWE).

    * The hypothetical pension (called the indicative pension amount) is part of the method used to work out what the percentage increase should be (called the 55plus percentage). The hypothetical pension does not represent the amount of any actual pension benefit, or the amount that any actual pension benefit should be. It is just a device to work out the percentage by which actual pension benefits should be increased.

    * Each 1 January and 1 July, the amount of the hypothetical pension, as indexed by the higher of CPI and LCI, is compared with what the amount of the hypothetical pension should be if it is to continue to be at least 27.7% of MTAWE. If the CPI/LCI result is higher than the MTAWE result, the 55plus percentage is the higher of the percentage movements in CPI and LCI. If the MTAWE result is higher, the 55plus percentage is the percentage increase needed to maintain the hypothetical pension at 27.7% of MTAWE.

    * Once the 55plus percentage has been worked out, affected pension benefits are increased by that percentage.

##### 98GB  Increase for pensioners aged 55 or older

    * Increase by 55plus percentage

    * (1) The increase provided for by subsection 98B(1), for a pensioner aged 55 or older at the commencement of a prescribed halfyear (the **_relevant prescribed halfyear_**), is the 55plus percentage of the pensioner's relevant rate of pension benefit in relation to the relevant prescribed halfyear.

    * 55plus percentage

    * (2) This is how to work out the 55plus percentage for the relevant prescribed halfyear:

Method statement

      * Step 1.	Work out the prescribed percentage for the prescribed halfyear.

      * Step 2.	Use section 98GD to work out the LCI percentage for the prescribed halfyear.

      * Step 3.	Take the higher of the percentages worked out in steps 1 and 2. (If they are the same, use the step 1 percentage.) This is the **_CPI/LCI percentage_**.

      * Step 4.	Take the indicative pension amount for the prescribed halfyear immediately before the relevant prescribed halfyear. This is the **_current indicative pension amount_**.

      * Step 5.	Work out the amount that is the CPI/LCI percentage of the current indicative pension amount and add it to the current indicative pension amount. This is the **_CPI/LCI result_**.

      * Step 6.	Use section 98GE to work out the MTAWE result.

      * Step 7.	If the CPI/LCI result is the same as or higher than the MTAWE result, the **_55plus percentage _**for the prescribed halfyear is the CPI/LCI percentage. If the CPI/LCI result is lower than the MTAWE result, the **_55plus percentage _**for the prescribed halfyear is the percentage worked out under section 98GF.

    * Nil or negative change

    * (3) If, for a prescribed halfyear:

     * (a) the CPI/LCI result in step 5 is the same as the current indicative pension amount; and

     * (b) the MTAWE result in step 6 is the same as or lower than the current indicative pension amount;

    * then, for that prescribed halfyear:

     * (c) the 55plus percentage is taken to be 0%; and

     * (d) subsection 98B(1) does not provide for an increase for a pensioner aged 55 or older at the commencement of that halfyear.

##### 98GC  Indicative pension amount

    * (1) The **_indicative pension amount _**is:

     * (a) for the prescribed halfyear commencing on 1 January 2014--$19,541.91; and

     * (b) for a later prescribed halfyear--the amount most recently substituted in accordance with subsection (2).

       * Note: The indicative pension amount is a hypothetical amount that does not represent the amount of any actual pension benefit, or the amount that any actual pension benefit should be. It is just a device to work out the percentage by which actual pension benefits should be increased.

    * (2) The indicative pension amount for the prescribed halfyear commencing on 1 January 2014 is to be increased, on 1 July 2014 and each later 1 January and 1 July, by the 55plus percentage, as if the amount were a pension benefit payable to a pensioner aged 55 or older on the day. Immediately after the increase, the increased amount is substituted as the indicative pension amount.

    * (3) The reference in subsection (2) to the increased amount includes a reference to an amount that, because the 55plus percentage for a prescribed halfyear was 0%, has not changed.

##### 98GD  LCI percentage

    * LCI percentage

    * (1) Subject to subsection (2), the **_LCI percentage _**for a prescribed halfyear is:

    * where: 

    * **_base quarter LCI number _**means the LCI number in respect of the March quarter or September quarter that:

     * (a) is before the first quarter of the halfyear immediately before the prescribed halfyear; and

     * (b) has the highest LCI number.

    * **_first quarter LCI number_** means the LCI number in respect of the first quarter of the halfyear immediately before the prescribed halfyear.

    * **_LCI number_**, in respect of a quarter, is the All Groups Pensioner and Beneficiary Living Cost Index number that is the weighted average of the 8 capital cities and is published by the Statistician in respect of the quarter.

    * Nil or negative change

    * (2) If the first quarter LCI number is equal to or less than the base quarter LCI number, the LCI percentage for the prescribed halfyear is taken to be 0%.

##### 98GE  MTAWE result

    * (1) For the purposes of step 6 of the method statement in subsection 98GB(2), the **_MTAWE result _**is the amount that is 27.7% of the annualised MTAWE figure for the quarter for which the Statistician has most recently published the amount referred to in subsection (2).

    * (2) For the purposes of subsection (1), the **_annualised MTAWE figure_**, for a quarter, is 52 times the amount set out for the reference period in the quarter under the headings "Average Weekly Earnings of Employees, Australia--Males--All males--Total earnings--ORIGINAL" in a document published by the Statistician entitled "Average Weekly Earnings, States and Australia".

    * (3) If at any time (whether before or after the commencement of this section), the Statistician publishes the amount referred to in subsection (2):

     * (a) under differently described headings (the **_new headings_**); or

     * (b) in a document entitled otherwise than as described in subsection (2) (the **_new document_**);

    * then the annualised MTAWE figure is to be calculated in accordance with subsection (2) as if the references to:

     * (c) "Average Weekly Earnings of Employees, Australia--Males--All males--Total earnings--ORIGINAL"; or

     * (d) "Average Weekly Earnings, States and Australia";

    * were references to either of the new headings or the new document, or both of them, as the case requires.

    * (4) For the purposes of this section, the **_reference period_** in a particular quarter is the period described by the Statistician as the pay period ending on or before a specified day that is the third Friday of the middle month of that quarter.

##### 98GF  55plus percentage if MTAWE result is higher

    * For the purposes of step 7 of the method statement in subsection 98GB(2), if this section applies then the **_55plus percentage_**, for the prescribed halfyear, is:

    * that member or the personal representative of that member, as the case requires, is not liable to pay the difference between the amount of that contribution and the amount so paid or deducted unless:

     * (c) the member retired or died at the end of the relevant part of the prescribed period; and
