### Part 2--DSAP payments

#### Division 1--DSAP scheme

##### 9  Simplified outline

   * The following is a simplified outline of this Division: 

     *  	This Division provides a framework for the making of DSAP payments.

     *  	The Minister is required to formulate a scheme (the **_DSAP scheme_**) for the grant of payment rights to entities who held an eligible interest in a dairy farm enterprise on 28 September 1999.

     *  	The DSAP scheme will provide for 3 types of payment rights, as follows:

       * (a) standard payment rights; 

       * (b) exceptional events supplementary payment rights.

       * (c) anomalous circumstances payment rights.

     *  	Standard payment rights will be based on milk deliveries in 1998-1999, and will be worked out by reference to a rate of 46.23 cents per litre for market milk and a national average rate of 8.96 cents per litre for manufacturing milk.

     *  	Exceptional events supplementary payment rights may be granted in cases where, because of exceptional events, the volume of milk deliveries in 1998-1999 is less than 70% of the average milk deliveries in the 3 previous financial years.

     *  	Anomalous circumstances payment rights may be granted to entities who have been affected by anomalous circumstances.

     *  	Entities who wish to obtain a payment right under the DSAP scheme must undertake a farm business assessment.

     *  	The total value of the payment rights granted to an entity must not exceed $350,000 unless more than 70% of the entity's total gross income consists of dairy income.

     *  	Payment rights will be divided into units, where each unit has a face value of $32.

     *  	A registered owner of a unit will be entitled to a quarterly payment of $1 for each of the 32 quarters in the 8-year period beginning on 1 July 2000.

##### 10  DSAP scheme

   * Within 14 days after the commencement of this Schedule, the Minister must, by writing, formulate a scheme (the **_DSAP scheme_**) for:

     * (a) the grant of payment rights to entities who:

      * (i) held an eligible interest in a dairy farm enterprise at 6.30 pm on 28 September 1999; and

      * (ii) satisfy such other conditions as are set out in the scheme; and

     * (b) the division of payment rights into units; and

     * (c) the registration of units; and

     * (d) the making of payments by the Corporation to registered owners of units.

##### 11  General policy objectives for the DSAP scheme

   * The DSAP scheme must be directed towards ensuring the achievement of the policy objectives set out in clauses 12 to 23.

##### 12  Types of payment rights

   * (1) This clause sets out a policy objective for the DSAP scheme.

   * (2) The objective is that there are to be 3 types of payment rights, as follows:

     * (a) the first type of payment rights are to be known as **_standard payment rights_**;

     * (b) the second type of payment rights are to be known as **_exceptional events supplementary payment rights_**;

     * (c) the third type of payment rights are to be known as **_anomalous circumstances payment rights_**.

##### 13  Standard payment right

   * (1) This clause sets out policy objectives for the DSAP scheme.

   * _Basic eligibility criteria_

   * _	(2)	The first objective is that an entity is not eligible to be granted a standard payment right unless:

     * (a) the entity held an eligible interest in a dairy farm enterprise at 6.30 pm on 28 September 1999; and

     * (b) either or both of the following conditions are satisfied:

      * (i) during the 1998-1999 financial year, the dairy farm enterprise delivered market milk;

      * (ii) during the 1998-1999 financial year, the dairy farm enterprise delivered manufacturing milk.

   * _Calculation of face value_

   * _	(3)	The second objective is that the calculation of the face value of an entity's standard payment right must be consistent with the following examples:

     * (a) if the entity is the only entity who had an eligible interest in the dairy farm enterprise at 6.30 pm on 28 September 1999--the face value of the entity's standard payment right equals the overall enterprise amount;

     * (b) if:

      * (i) there are 2 or more entities who had an eligible interest in the dairy farm enterprise at 6.30 pm on 28 September 1999; and

      * (ii) under the scheme, the enterprise is not taken to be subject to an eligible dairy sharefarming arrangement or an eligible dairy leasing arrangement;

     * the face value of the first-mentioned entity's standard payment right is that entity's share of the overall enterprise amount, worked out on a basis that corresponds to the basis on which milk revenues were shared between the entities as at 6.30 pm on 28 September 1999;

     * (c) if:

      * (i) there are 2 entities who had an eligible interest in the dairy farm enterprise at 6.30 pm on 28 September 1999; and

      * (ii) under the scheme, the enterprise is taken to be subject to an eligible dairy sharefarming arrangement and those entities are taken to be parties to that arrangement; and

      * (iii) the first-mentioned entity is an entity who, under the scheme, is taken to have provided the essential capital contribution required to achieve access to the market milk premium;

     * the face value of the first-mentioned entity's standard payment right is the sum of:

      * (iv) the premium component of the overall enterprise amount; and

      * (v) that entity's share of the non-premium component of the overall enterprise amount, worked out on a basis that corresponds to the basis on which milk revenues were shared between the entities as at 6.30 pm on 28 September 1999;

     * (d) if:

      * (i) there are 2 entities who had an eligible interest in the dairy farm enterprise at 6.30 pm on 28 September 1999; and

      * (ii) under the scheme, the enterprise is taken to be subject to an eligible dairy sharefarming arrangement and those entities are taken to be parties to that arrangement; and

      * (iii) the first-mentioned entity is not an entity who, under the scheme, is taken to have provided the essential capital contribution required to achieve access to the market milk premium;

     * the face value of the first-mentioned entity's standard payment right is that entity's share of the non-premium component of the overall enterprise amount, worked out on a basis that corresponds to the basis on which milk revenues were shared between the entities as at 6.30 pm on 28 September 1999;

     * (e) if:

      * (i) there are 2 entities who had an eligible interest in the dairy farm enterprise at 6.30 pm on 28 September 1999; and

      * (ii) under the scheme, the enterprise is taken to be subject to an eligible dairy leasing arrangement and those entities are taken to be parties to that arrangement; and

      * (iii) the first-mentioned entity is an entity who, under the scheme, is taken to have provided the essential capital contribution required to achieve access to the market milk premium;

     * the face value of the first-mentioned entity's standard payment right is the premium component of the overall enterprise amount;

     * (f) if:

      * (i) there are 2 entities who had an eligible interest in the dairy farm enterprise at 6.30 pm on 28 September 1999; and

      * (ii) under the scheme, the enterprise is taken to be subject to an eligible dairy leasing arrangement and those entities are taken to be parties to that arrangement; and

      * (iii) the first-mentioned entity is not an entity who, under the scheme, is taken to have provided the essential capital contribution required to achieve access to the market milk premium;

     * the face value of the first-mentioned entity's standard payment right is the non-premium component of the overall enterprise amount.

   * (4) Paragraphs (3)(c), (d), (e) and (f) deal with common types of arrangements that involve 2 parties. Those paragraphs do not, by implication, limit the capacity of the DSAP scheme to deal with less common types of arrangements that involve 3 or more parties--see clause 34.

   * _Essential capital contribution_

   * _	(5)	In formulating a provision of the DSAP scheme under which an entity is taken to have provided the essential capital contribution required to achieve access to the market milk premium, the Minister must not have regard to any matters other than the following:

     * (a) whether the entity is the owner of a quota relating to the delivery of market milk;

     * (b) whether the entity is the owner of the land on which the eligible dairy farm enterprise is carried on;

     * (c) whether the entity is the owner of a significant proportion of the livestock used in, or for purposes incidental to, the carrying on of the eligible dairy farm enterprise.

   * (6) For the purposes of paragraph (5)(c), the proportion of livestock owned by a partner in a partnership is taken to be the same as the proportion of the livestock owned by the partnership.

   * (7) For the purposes of paragraph (5)(c), a proportion of less than 25% is taken not to be a significant proportion.

     * (a) the entity has already been granted a standard payment right in respect of the enterprise; and

     * (b) the entity satisfies the DAA that, as a result of one or more events that, under the scheme, are taken to be recognised exceptional events, the volume of market milk and manufacturing milk delivered by the enterprise during the 1998-1999 financial year is less than 70% of the average annual volume of market milk and manufacturing milk delivered by the enterprise in the following 3 financial years:

      * (i) the 1997-1998 financial year;

      * (ii) the 1996-1997 financial year;

      * (iii) the 1995-1996 financial year.

   * _Total face value of payment rights_

     * (b) the total face value of the exceptional events supplementary payment rights granted to the entity in respect of the enterprise;

   * must not exceed the amount that would have been the total face value of the standard payment right if: 

     * (c) the volume of market milk delivered by the dairy farm enterprise during the 1998-1999 financial year had equalled the average annual volume of market milk delivered by the enterprise in the following 3 financial years:
