##### 4  Increase in pensions payable to prescribed pensioners otherwise than in respect of units

    * (1) This section applies to a prescribed pensioner to whom the next succeeding section does not apply.

    * (2) For the purposes of this section, the _Defence Forces Retirement Benefits Act 19481958_ shall be deemed to have effect as if:

     * (a) subsection (2) of section thirtyeight of that Act provided that, subject to section fifty of that Act, the pension payable to an officer under that section were a pension at such rate set out in column four of Part I of the First Schedule to this Act as is applicable to the officer having regard to the description set out in column one, two or three of that Part that applied to the officer at the date of his retirement;

     * (b) subsection (3) of section thirtynine of that Act provided that the deduction under subsection (2) of that section were a deduction in accordance with the Second Schedule to this Act;

     * (c) subsection (2) of section fortyone of that Act provided that, subject to section fifty of that Act, the pension payable to a member under that section were:

      * (i) a pension at such rate set out in column four of Part II of the First Schedule to this Act as is applicable to the member having regard to the description set out in column one, two or three of that Part that applied to the member at the date of his retirement; and

      * (ii) in the case of a member who had completed more than twenty year's service for pension before attaining the retiring age for the rank held by him, additional pension, if any, in accordance with the Third Schedule to this Act for each completed year of service for pension in excess of twenty years;

     * (d) subsection (2A) of section fortyeight of that Act provided that the deduction under subsection (2) of that section were a deduction in accordance with the Second Schedule to this Act; and

     * (e) the reference in the Eighth Schedule to that Act to the amounts of ?182 and ?91 were references to the amounts of ?208 and ?104 respectively.

    * (3) Where the pension payable to a pensioner to whom this section applies would, if the pension were payable to him in accordance with the _Defence Forces Retirement Benefits Act 19481958_ as that Act is deemed to have effect for the purposes of this section, be payable at a rate higher than the rate at which, but for this section, the pension would be payable, he is entitled to an increase in the rate of the pension to that higher rate.

    * (4) In the application of this section to a prescribed pensioner to whom additional pension is payable under section fortysix of the _Defence Forces Retirement Benefits Act 19481958_, there shall be taken into account for the purpose of ascertaining the pension that would have been payable to the pensioner if he had continued to serve until he attained the age of sixty years the amount, if any, by which that pension would have been increased by virtue of the next succeeding section.

##### 5  Increase in pensions payable in respect of units

    * (1) This section applies to a prescribed pensioner to whom pension is payable under section fortyfive, subsection (1) of section fiftytwo or subparagraph (ii) of paragraph (c) of subsection (2) of section fiftytwo of the _Defence Forces Retirement Benefits Act 19481958_.

whichever is the greater.

**_additional unit entitlement,_** in relation to a pensioner to whom this section applies, means the number of units, if any, by which his adjusted unit entitlement exceeds his actual unit entitlement.

**_adjusted unit entitlement_**, in relation to a pensioner to whom this section applies, means such number of units set out in column five of the First Schedule to this Act as is applicable to the pensioner having regard to the description set out in column one, two or three of that Schedule that applied to the pensioner at the date of his retirement.

     * (b) in relation to a pensioner to whom this section applies and to whom pension is payable under subparagraph (ii) of paragraph (c) of subsection (2) of section fiftytwo of that Act--means the rate of Sixteen pounds five shillings per annum;

or, where the actual unit contribution of the pensioner is less than his actual unit entitlement, such rate as bears to the rate applicable to him under paragraph (a) or (b) of this definition the same proportion as his actual unit contribution bears to his actual unit entitlement.

    * (3) Where the adjusted unit entitlement of a pensioner to whom this section applies exceeds his actual unit entitlement, the pensioner is, subject to this Act, entitled to an increase in the pension that is payable to him, being an increase calculated at the prescribed rate in respect of each unit included in his additional unit entitlement.

##### 8  Application of increases to suspended pensions

    * Where a person would, but for section fiftythree A of the _Defence Forces Retirement Benefits Act 19481959_, be a prescribed pensioner for the purposes of this Act, that person shall, upon his pension again becoming payable to him after the commencement of this Act, be entitled to an increase in the pension equal to the increase to which he would have been entitled if he had been a prescribed pensioner.
