### Part 2--DSAP payments and SDA payments

#### Division 1--DSAP scheme

##### 9  Simplified outline

    * The following is a simplified outline of this Division: 

     *  	This Division provides a framework for the making of DSAP payments.

     *  	The Minister is required to formulate a scheme (the **_DSAP scheme_**) for the grant of payment rights to entities who held an eligible interest in a dairy farm enterprise on 28 September 1999.

     *  	The DSAP scheme will provide for 3 types of payment rights, as follows:

       * (a) standard payment rights; 

       * (b) exceptional events supplementary payment rights.

       * (c) anomalous circumstances payment rights.

     *  	Standard payment rights will be based on milk deliveries in 19981999, and will be worked out by reference to a rate of 46.23 cents per litre for market milk and a national average rate of 8.96 cents per litre for manufacturing milk.

     *  	Exceptional events supplementary payment rights may be granted in cases where, because of exceptional events, the volume of milk deliveries in 19981999 is less than 70% of the average milk deliveries in the 3 previous financial years.

     *  	Anomalous circumstances payment rights may be granted to entities who have been affected by anomalous circumstances.

     *  	Entities who wish to obtain a payment right under the DSAP scheme must undertake a farm business assessment.

     *  	The total value of the payment rights granted to an entity must not exceed $350,000 unless more than 70% of the entity's total gross income consists of dairy income.

     *  	Payment rights will be divided into units, where each unit has a face value of $32.

     *  	A registered owner of a unit will be entitled to a quarterly payment of $1 for each of the 32 quarters in the 8year period beginning on 1 July 2000.

##### 10  DSAP scheme

     * (b) if:

      * (i) there are 2 or more entities who had an eligible interest in the dairy farm enterprise at  on 28 September 1999; and

      * (ii) under the scheme, the enterprise is not taken to be subject to an eligible dairy sharefarming arrangement or an eligible dairy leasing arrangement;

     * the face value of the firstmentioned entity's standard payment right is that entity's share of the overall enterprise amount, worked out on a basis that corresponds to the basis on which milk revenues were shared between the entities as at 6.30 pm on 28 September 1999;

     * (c) if:

      * (i) there are 2 entities who had an eligible interest in the dairy farm enterprise at  on 28 September 1999; and

      * (iii) the firstmentioned entity is not an entity who, under the scheme, is taken to have provided the essential capital contribution required to achieve access to the market milk premium;

     * the face value of the firstmentioned entity's standard payment right is that entity's share of the nonpremium component of the overall enterprise amount, worked out on a basis that corresponds to the basis on which milk revenues were shared between the entities as at 6.30 pm on 28 September 1999;

     * (e) if:

    * (4) Paragraphs (3)(c), (d), (e) and (f) deal with common types of arrangements that involve 2 parties. Those paragraphs do not, by implication, limit the capacity of the DSAP scheme to deal with less common types of arrangements that involve 3 or more parties--see clause 34.

    * Essential capital contribution

    * (5) In formulating a provision of the DSAP scheme under which an entity is taken to have provided the essential capital contribution required to achieve access to the market milk premium, the Minister must not have regard to any matters other than the following:

     * (c) the number (the **_market milk number_**) worked out in accordance with the following formula is at least 25.1 (rounding to 1 decimal place and rounding up if the second decimal place is 5 or more):

        * Note: See also subclause (4) for how those delivery numbers are worked out.

    * Calculation of face value

    * (2) It is a policy objective that the face value of an entity's basic market milk payment right is to be a share (worked out in accordance with the SDA scheme) of the overall market milk amount for the qualifying enterprise.

        * Note: See also subclause (5) for how those delivery numbers are worked out.

    * Calculation of face value

    * (2) It is a policy objective that the face value of an entity's additional market milk payment right is to be a share (worked out in accordance with the SDA scheme) of the overall market milk amount for the qualifying enterprise.

    * Interpretation

    * (3) For the purposes of this clause, the **_overall market milk amount _**for the qualifying enterprise is the amount worked out in accordance with the following formula:

    * where: 

    * **_relevant cents _**means:

     * (a) if the market milk number is at least 45--12 cents; or
