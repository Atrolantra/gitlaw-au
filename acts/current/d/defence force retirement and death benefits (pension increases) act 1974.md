   * **1  Short title **[_see_ Note 1]

   * This Act may be cited as the _Defence Force Retirement and Death Benefits (Pension Increases) Act 1974_. 

##### 2  Commencement

   * This Act shall be deemed to have come into operation on 1 July 1974. 

##### 3  Interpretation

   * (1) For the purposes of this Act, the prescribed percentage is whichever is the lower of:

     * (a) 1.4 times the percentage that represents A--B expressed as a percentage of B; or

     * (b) the percentage that represents C--D expressed as a percentage of D;

   * where: 

   * **A** is the all groups consumer price index number for the weighted average of the 6 State capital cities published by the Statistician in respect of the March quarter of the year 1974;

   * **B** is the all groups consumer price index number for the weighted average of the 6 State capital cities published by the Statistician in respect of the March quarter of the year 1973;

   * **C** is the estimate of the seasonally adjusted average weekly earnings per employed male unit throughout Australia published by the Statistician in respect of the March quarter of the year 1974; and

   * **D** is the estimate of the seasonally adjusted average weekly earnings per employed male unit throughout Australia published by the Statistician in respect of the March quarter of the year 1973. 

   * (2) If, at any time, whether before or after the commencement of this Act, the Statistician has published in respect of the March quarter of the year 1974 or the March quarter of the year 1973, an all groups consumer price index number for the weighted average of the 6 State capital cities or an estimate of the seasonally adjusted average weekly earnings per employed male unit throughout Australia in substitution for an index number or estimate previously published by him in respect of that quarter, the publication of the later index number or estimate shall be disregarded for the purposes of this Act. 

   * (3) If the prescribed percentage for the purposes of this Act is or includes a fraction of one-tenth of 1 per centum:

     * (a) if that fraction is less than one-half of one-tenth--that fraction shall be disregarded; and

     * (b) if that fraction is not less than one-half of one-tenth--that fraction shall be treated as one-tenth. 

   * (4) A reference in this Act to the Statistician shall be read as a reference to the Commonwealth Statistician. 

##### 4  Increases to be paid out of Consolidated Revenue Fund

##### 5  Incorporation with the Defence Forces Retirement Benefits Act

   * This part is incorporated, and shall be read as one, with the _Defence Forces Retirement Benefits Act 1948-1973_. 

##### 6  Interpretation

   * In this Part, unless the contrary intention appears:

     * (b) the estimate of the seasonally adjusted average weekly earnings per employed male unit throughout Australia published by the Statistician in respect of the March quarter of the year 1974 exceeds the estimate of the seasonally adjusted average weekly earnings per employed male unit throughout Australia published by the Statistician in respect of the March quarter of the year 1973;
