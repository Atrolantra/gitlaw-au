##### 5  When a person is a member of the Reserves

    * Membership of the Reserves

    * (1) For the purposes of this Act, a person who has been engaged (by enlistment, appointment or transfer) as a member of the Reserves at a particular time (the **_engagement time_**) is to be treated as a member of the Reserves until:

     * (a) the engagement ends; or

     * (b) during a service year:

      * (i) the engagement does not end; but

      * (ii) the person does not perform effective service as a member of the Reserves.

    * Effect of failure to perform effective service

    * (2) If a person's membership of the Reserves ends under paragraph (1)(b) in relation to a service year, this Act applies to the person, and is taken to have applied to the person, as if he or she had:

     * (a) in the case of a person who was a member of the Reserves at the end of the previous service year--stopped being a member of the Reserves immediately after the end of the previous service year; or

     * (b) in any other case--not been engaged as a member of the Reserves at the engagement time.

        * Note: This section may have the following effects:

         * (a) the time at which a person is taken to stop being a member of the Reserves (or of the Defence Force) may be affected;

         * (b) there may be a retrospective loss of entitlements in relation to subsidy certificates, the payment of subsidy, service credits and accrued subsidy periods and loan limits;

         * (c) in particular, an authorisation of the payment of subsidy on the basis of a person's membership of the Reserves may be revoked retrospectively (see section 44);

         * (d) if a subsidised borrower who is taken not to have been a member of the Reserves because of the operation of subsection (2) would have been otherwise entitled to subsidy, the authorisation of the payment of subsidy to the person may be varied retrospectively (see section 45).

        * Example: A person is engaged as a member of the Reserves. The person is given a subsidy certificate under Part 3 on the basis of eligibility as a serving member of the Reserves. The person starts to receive amounts of monthly subsidy accordingly.

        * However, at the end of the service year, the person has not performed effective service as a member of the Reserves.

        * Because of subsection (2), this Act applies as if the person was not entitled to be given the subsidy certificate (because he or she was not eligible as a member of the Reserves).

        * As a result, the original authorisation of the payment of subsidy may be revoked or varied (see sections 44 and 45). Amounts of subsidy to which the person is not entitled (because of the revocation or variation) are recoverable as overpayments under Division 6 of Part 4.

     * (c) the conditions under Subdivision B are met.

    * (7) In the application of this section to a surviving partner (of a deceased partner) who is a subsidised borrower because of section 60 or 61:

     * (a) a reference in paragraph (2)(c) to the payment of subsidy includes a reference to the payment of subsidy to the deceased partner during the entitlement period; and

     * (b) subsection (4) does not apply to the deceased partner's entitlement to subsidy.

        * Note 1: Revocation of an authorisation is grounds for the Secretary to refuse to give a subsidy certificate on a future occasion, and to refuse authorisation for the payment of subsidy in relation to a future entitlement period (see sections 16 and 27).

        * Note 2: If section 45 (variation of authorisation of payment of subsidy--when a person is not a member of the Reserves) applies, the authorisation of the payment of subsidy cannot be revoked under this section because of the operation of subsection 5(2) (which relates to when a member stops being a member of the Reserves) (see subsection 45(5)).

##### 45  Variation of authorisation of payment of subsidy--when a person is not a member of the Reserves

    * Scope

    * (1) This section applies in relation to a subsidised borrower if the Secretary is satisfied that, immediately after the end of a service year:

     * (a) the Secretary, under section 27, has authorised the payment of subsidy to the subsidised borrower during an entitlement period beginning at or after the start of the service year on the basis of the borrower's eligibility as a member of the Reserves; and

     * (b) subsection 5(2) applies to the subsidised borrower's membership of the Reserves in relation to the service year; and

     * (c) by the operation of that subsection, the Secretary would (apart from this section) have the power to revoke the authorisation of the payment of subsidy to the subsidised borrower under section 44; and

     * (d) during the entitlement period, the Secretary could have given a subsidy certificate to the subsidised borrower, and subsidy on the basis of that certificate would have been payable to the borrower, otherwise than on the basis of the borrower's eligibility as a member of the Reserves.

        * Example 1: Paragraph (d) may apply because of the operation of subsection 5(2). Subsidy might have otherwise been payable to the subsidised borrower on the basis of the borrower's eligibility as a separated member (as the result of the person's being taken to have stopped being a member of the Reserves).

        * Example 2: Paragraph (d) may also apply despite the operation of subsection 5(2). If the subsidised borrower's partner is a member of the Defence Force, and the partner dies, subsidy might in any case have been payable to the borrower as the surviving partner of the deceased partner.

    * Variation of authorisation

    * (2) The Secretary may, by written notice to the subsidised borrower, vary the authorisation of the payment of subsidy to the borrower in relation to the entitlement period.

        * Note: Part 5 provides for the administrative review of the Secretary's decision to vary the authorisation.

    * (3) The Secretary may give a notice under subsection (2) during the entitlement period, or at any time after the end of the entitlement period.

    * Effect of variation

    * (4) If an authorisation is varied under this section:

     * (a) subsidy is payable, and is taken to have become payable, to the subsidised borrower on the basis of the borrower's eligibility (otherwise than as a member of the Reserves) as mentioned in paragraph (1)(d); and

     * (b) subsidy is taken to have become (and continued) to be so payable (subject otherwise to this Act) with effect from the earliest time that subsidy would have been payable to the subsidised borrower as mentioned in paragraph (1)(d).

        * Note: If the amount of subsidy paid to the subsidised borrower during the entitlement period on the basis of the borrower's membership of the Reserves exceeds the amount of subsidy payable to the borrower as a result of the operation of this subsection, the Commonwealth may recover the amount of the excess as an overpayment (see Division 6).

    * Application of section 44

    * (5) If this section applies in relation to the authorisation of the payment of subsidy to a subsidised borrower, the authorisation cannot be revoked under section 44 only because of the operation of subsection 5(2).

    * Notice to loan provider

    * (6) The Secretary must give a copy of a notice under subsection (2) to the loan provider who made the loan to the subsidised borrower.

    * If the subsidised borrower has died

    * (7) If the subsidised borrower has died, the Secretary may vary the authorisation of the payment of subsidy to the subsidised borrower by giving a notice under subsection (2) to the borrower's legal personal representative.

#### Division 2--Service credits

##### 46  Working out service credits

    * (1) Whether a person has a **_service credit_** at a particular time (the **_subsidy time_**) for the purposes of an entitlement period, and the length of time standing to the person's service credit, is worked out as follows.

Method statement

      * Step 1.	Work out the person's accrued subsidy period under section 47, in completed months, as at the subsidy time.

      * Step 2.	Add together the following:

        * (a) if a subsidy lump sum has become payable to the person--the number of months of service credit accessed for the subsidy lump sum (see section 54);

        * (b) in any case--the number of months in respect of which monthly subsidy has been payable in relation to the person under this Act, as at the subsidy time;

        * (c) in any case--the number of months in respect of which subsidy has been payable in relation to the person under the _Defence Force (Home Loans Assistance) Act 1990_ and the _Defence Service Homes Act 1918_, as at the subsidy time.

      * Step 3.	If the step 1 result exceeds the step 2 result, the person has a **_service credit_** at the subsidy time.

      * Step 4.	The number of months (if any) by which the step 1 result exceeds the step 2 result is the number of months standing to the person's service credit.

    * (2) Step 2 of the method statement in subsection (1):

     * (a) includes months during a previous entitlement period or periods; and

     * (b) includes a reference to a subsidy lump sum that became payable to a person during a previous entitlement period; and

     * (c) includes months during which subsidy was paid (under this or another Act) whether or not the months are continuous.

##### 47  Service credits--working out accrued subsidy periods

    * (1) A person's **_accrued subsidy period_**, at a particular time, is the period that applies to the person in accordance with the following table.

        * Note: Section 7 deals with when someone is **_eligible_**. A person may be eligible in different capacities at different times (see sections 8 to 13). A person's eligibility as recorded on his or her subsidy certificate may not reflect the person's current eligibility.

    * Effective service covered

    * (2) This section covers effective service in the Defence Force whether that service takes place before, on or after the commencing day, unless the context otherwise requires.

##### 48  Service credits--additional allowance for warlike service

    * Scope

    * (1) This section applies to a person who has performed warlike service.

    * Additional months of subsidy

    * (2) For the purpose of item 6 of the table in subsection 47(1), the person's additional months of subsidy are worked out in accordance with the following table.

        * Example 1: A person who has performed a total of 4 days warlike service is entitled to 24 additional months (2 years) of subsidy.

        * Example 2: A person who has performed a total of 3 months and 6 days warlike service is entitled to 36 additional months (3 years) of subsidy.

        * Example 3: A person who has performed a total of 9 months and one day warlike service is entitled to 60 additional months (5 years) of subsidy.

    * Repatriation from warlike service due to wounds, injury or illness

    * (3) If the person is repatriated from warlike service because of wounds, injury or illness, subsection (2) applies as if the person had continued to perform warlike service until the end of the period the Secretary considers the person could reasonably have expected (at the time of repatriation) to have continued to have undertaken warlike service, but for the repatriation.

    * (4) In making a decision under subsection (3), the Secretary must have regard to the following:

     * (a) information given to the person about the expected length of warlike service;

     * (b) information given to the commander of the person's unit about the expected length of the warlike service;

     * (c) any other relevant matter.

        * Note: Part 5 provides for the administrative review of a decision to determine the end of a period of warlike service under subsection (3).

#### Division 3--Amount of subsidy

##### Subdivision A--Monthly subsidy

##### 49  Working out monthly subsidy

    * If subsidy is payable to a subsidised borrower in relation to a subsidised loan during an entitlement period, the amount of subsidy (the subsidised borrower's **_monthly subsidy_**) for each month during the period is worked out in accordance with the following formula:

        * Note: The average monthly interest is worked out under section 50.

##### 50  Monthly subsidy--average monthly interest

    * (1) **_Average monthly interest_** is the amount worked out in accordance with the following formula:

        * Note: The loan capital is worked out under section 51.

    * (2) The **_monthly repayment_**, for the formula in subsection (1), is the amount worked out in accordance with the formula:

        * Note 1: The loan capital is worked out under section 51.

        * Note 2: The median interest rate is worked out under section 53.

##### 51  Monthly subsidy--loan capital

    * Loan capital

    * (1) The **_loan capital _**in respect of which subsidy is payable to a subsidised borrower in relation to a subsidised loan during an entitlement period is the lesser of the following amounts:

     * (a) the capital amount owing by the subsidised borrower on the subsidised loan on the first authorisation day for that period;

     * (b) the amount of the subsidised borrower's loan limit (see subsection (2)), as applicable from time to time during the entitlement period.

        * Note: Special rules may apply for working out the amount of loan capital if a subsidised borrower and another person are liable in respect of the same subsidised loan (see sections 51A, 51B and 51C).

    * Loan limit--general rule

    * (2) The **_loan limit _**at a particular time (the **_loan limit time_**) for a subsidised borrower who meets a description in an item in the following table at the loan limit time is as set out in the item according to the years of effective service completed (whether before or after the commencing day) by the borrower as at the loan limit time.

        * Note: For the applicable average house price, see subsection (3).

    * Loan limit--applicable average house price

    * (3) The average house price in relation to a loan limit for a subsidised loan during an entitlement period is the average house price applicable on the first authorisation day for that period.

##### 51A  Monthly subsidy--shared liability between partners for subsidised loans 

    * Scope

    * (1) This section applies to a subsidised borrower if the borrower and his or her partner are parties to a single subsidised loan, whether they are liable jointly and severally, or individually.

    * Loan capital rules

    * (2) The following table has effect for the purposes of section 51:

##### 51B  Monthly subsidy--shared liability between partners for subsidised loans if partner dies etc.

    * Scope

     * (a) the borrower's partner (the **_deceased borrower_**) has died; and

     * (b) at the time of death, item 1 of the table in subsection 51A(2) applied to the surviving borrower and the deceased borrower because:

      * (i) they were parties to a single subsidised loan; and

      * (ii) each of them was a subsidised borrower in his or her own right; and

     * (c) with effect from the time of death, the entitlement of the deceased borrower to the payment of subsidy in relation to the subsidised loan is transferred to the surviving borrower under section 60 (joint interest in land) or 61 (inherited interest in land).

    * (2) At and after the time of death:

     * (a) item 1 of the table in subsection 51A(2) continues to apply to the surviving borrower, in his or her own right, in relation to the subsidised loan; and

     * (b) for the purposes of that application, the amount of the surviving borrower's loan limit at a particular time (the **_loan limit time_**) is the average of the amounts of the loan limits that would apply in relation to the surviving borrower and the deceased borrower at the loan limit time if:

      * (i) the deceased borrower were still alive, and had the loan limit (under subsection 51(2)) that would have applied to him or her at the time of death if he or she were the sole party to the loan; and

      * (ii) the surviving borrower had the loan limit (under subsection 51(2)) that would apply to him or her at the loan limit time if he or she were the sole party to the loan.

        * Note: This section applies only to the surviving borrower's entitlement to subsidy in his or her own right, and not to the entitlement transferred from the deceased borrower (as mentioned in paragraph (1)(c)).

     * (a) the borrower is jointly and severally liable with another person in respect of the subsidised loan; and

     * (b) the other person is not the borrower's partner.

    * Loan capital rules

    * (2) For the purposes of section 51:

     * (a) the capital amount owing by the subsidised borrower on the subsidised loan on the first authorisation day for the entitlement period is taken to be 50% of the total capital amount owing on the subsidised loan at that time; and

     * (b) at any particular time, the subsidised borrower has the loan limit that applies under subsection 51(2).

        * Note 1: If liability for the subsidised loan is shared between the subsidised borrower and his or her partner, see sections 51A and 51B.

        * Note 2: If the subsidised borrower and another person (other than the borrower's partner) are liable individually in respect of the subsidised loan, section 51 applies in relation to the actual capital amount owing by the borrower on the subsidised loan.

    * (2) The **_notional monthly subsidy_**, for the formula in subsection (1), is the amount of monthly subsidy that would have been payable to the subsidised borrower in relation to the loan under section 49 on the following assumptions:

     * (a) that the subsidised borrower had not requested the payment of a subsidy lump sum;

     * (b) that the subsidised borrower's loan limit under section 51 is 40% of the average house price.

    * (3) The **_service credit accessed_**, for the formula in subsection (1), is the number of months standing to the subsidised borrower's service credit that is stated in the request for a subsidy lump sum under section 34.

    * (4) The transfer under subsection (2) does not break the continuity of the entitlement period in respect of which subsidy had been payable to the deceased partner immediately before his or her death.

##### 61  Surviving partners of subsidised borrowers--interest in land inherited by surviving partner etc.

    * Scope

    * (1) This section applies if:

    * Scope

    * (1) This section applies if:

        * Note 1: The person who dies is the **_deceased partner_** of his or her surviving partner (see section 4).

        * Note 2: Sections 60 and 61 provide for entitlement to subsidy to be transferred from a deceased partner to a surviving partner in certain circumstances, without the requirement for the surviving partner to obtain a new subsidy certificate.

    * Application of this Part to surviving partner

    * (2) This Part applies to the surviving partner in the same way as it would have applied to the deceased partner (had he or she not died), subject to section 64.

        * Note: Section 64 provides for how this Part applies to the surviving partner.

    * (3) However, if subsidy becomes payable to the surviving partner because of section 61 (with effect from the time of the death of the deceased partner), any subsidy paid to the surviving partner because of the operation of subsection (2) is taken not to have become payable.

        * Note: If subsidy is taken not to have become payable to a surviving partner because of this subsection, the Commonwealth may recover the amount of any payments of subsidy during the entitlement period from the surviving partner (see Division 6).

##### Subdivision C--Application of this Part

##### 64  Subsidy for surviving partners--how this Part applies

    * Scope

    * (1) This section applies if subsidy is payable to a surviving partner of a deceased partner because of section 60 or 61, or by the operation of section 63.

    * How this Part applies to surviving partner

    * (2) For the purposes of this Part, unless otherwise expressly provided, the surviving partner must be treated in the same way as the deceased partner, assuming that:

     * (a) the deceased partner had not died; and

     * (b) the deceased partner were eligible as provided in the following table.

        * Note: This section, together with sections 60, 61 and 63, ensures (among other things) that the deceased partner's accrued subsidy period and loan limit may be used in determining the surviving partner's entitlement to subsidy under this Part.

        * Example: Assume that subsidy has been payable to a person. The person dies, and this Part applies to the person's surviving partner.

        * Under subsection 46(1), the number of months in respect of which subsidy had been payable to the deceased partner (as at the time of death) must be taken into account in working out the surviving partner's service credit (see step 2 of the method statement in that subsection).

        * In addition, the number of months in respect of which subsidy has continued to be payable to the surviving partner must also be taken into account in working out the surviving partner's service credit (because after the death of the person, this Part applies to the surviving partner in the same way as it would have applied to the deceased partner).

##### 65  Subsidy for surviving partners--if surviving partner eligible in his or her own right etc.

    * To remove doubt, this Division applies:

     * (a) whether or not the surviving partner of the deceased partner is eligible under Part 2 in his or her own right; and

     * (a) the Secretary has paid an amount (the **_overpaid amount_**) to a loan provider as subsidy, by way of a payment into a subsidised loan account for the benefit of a subsidised borrower (the **_debtor_**); but

     * (b) the overpaid amount is not payable to the debtor under this Act.

    * (2) This Division applies in relation to a debtor who is not, or who has stopped being, a subsidised borrower as if the person were a subsidised borrower.

##### 67  Recovery of overpayments--amount payable

    * (1) The debtor must pay the amount (the **_due amount_**) covered by subsection (2) to the Commonwealth.

    * (2) The amount covered by this subsection is the sum of the following:

     * (a) the overpaid amount;
