    * (4) If:

     * (a) a relevant authority is required by an Act other than this Act to prepare an annual report for presentation to the Parliament; and

     * (b) the annual report is lodged with the responsible Minister within 3 months after the end of the period to which a program report relates;

    * then the authority may, with the consent of the responsible Minister, include that program report in the annual report.

    * (6) In subsection (5), **_final period_** means the period beginning on the last anniversary of the operative day before the day on which the authority ceased to be a relevant authority and ending on that day.

    * (1) The responsible Minister for a relevant authority may give general directions in writing to the authority about the performance of the authority's obligations under this Act.

    * (2) Where, under an Act other than this Act, a relevant authority submits a corporate plan to its responsible Minister, that Minister may have regard to that authority's obligations under this Act and, if that Minister considers that the corporate plan should be revised for the purposes of giving effect to those obligations, shall direct the authority in writing to revise the corporate plan accordingly.
