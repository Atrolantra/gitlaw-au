### An Act to impose registration charges in relation to the Commonwealth Register of Institutions and Courses for Overseas Students


    * 1**  Short title **[_see_ Note 1]

    * This Act may be cited as the _Education Services for Overseas Students (Registration Charges) Act 1997_.

    * 2**  Commencement **[_see_ Note 1]

    * This Act commences on the day on which the _Education Services for Overseas Students (Registration of Providers and Financial Regulation) Amendment Act (No. 1) 1997_ commences.

##### 3  Crown to be bound

    * This Act binds the Crown in each of its capacities.

##### 4  Interpretation

    * An expression used in this Act that is also used in the _Education Services for Overseas Students Act 2000 _has the same meaning as in that Act, unless the contrary intention appears.

##### 5  Annual registration charge

    * (1) A provider who is a registered provider on 1 January of a year is liable to pay an annual registration charge for the year.

      * Note: This section extends to a registered provider whose registration has been suspended.

    * _Amount of the charge_

    * _	(2)	The amount of the charge for the provider for the year (the **_charge year_**) is the sum of the following components:

     * (a) $1,300;

     * (b) $10 multiplied by the total enrolments for the provider in the previous year;

     * (c) $100 multiplied by the total number of courses for which the provider is registered on 1 January of the charge year;

     * (d) if the Minister has taken action against the provider under section 83 of the _Education Services for Overseas Students Act 2000_ in the previous year--$1,000.

      * Note 1: The dollar amounts are indexed under section 7.

      * Note 2: Regulations made under subsection (7) of this section may provide for lower dollar amounts and exemptions.

    * _Total enrolments_

    * _	(3)	The **_total enrolments_** for a provider in a year is worked out by adding together the number of enrolments of overseas students for each course for which the provider is registered in the year.

    * (4) When working out the enrolments for a course for a year:

     * (a) for a course of at least 26 weeks duration--each student who is enrolled in the course at any time during the year counts as one enrolment; and

     * (b) for a course of 13 or more weeks, but less than 26 weeks, duration--each student who is enrolled in the course at any time during the year counts as 0.5 of an enrolment; and

     * (c) for a course of less than 13 weeks duration--each student who is enrolled in the course at any time during the year counts as 0.25 of an enrolment.

    * _Working out what constitutes a course_

    * _	(5)	For the purposes of this section, a course that spans 2 or more years is taken to be a separate course in each of those years.

    * (6) For the purposes of this section, a course is taken to be a separate course at each location at which the provider is registered to provide the course.

    * _Regulations_

    * _	(7)	The regulations may prescribe any one or more of the following:

     * (a) a lower dollar amount for the purposes of paragraph (2)(a);

     * (b) one or more classes of providers who may pay the lower dollar amount prescribed under paragraph (a) of this subsection;

     * (c) one or more classes of providers who are exempt from the requirement to pay:

      * (i) the annual registration charge entirely; or

      * (ii) one or more components of the charge listed in paragraph (2)(a), (b) or (c).

    * (8) Regulations made under subsection (7) must be expressed to apply to the first calendar year beginning after the regulations are made and all later calendar years.

##### 6  Entry to market charges

    * _Application of section_

    * _	(1)	This section applies if:

     * (a) a designated authority recommends under section 9AA of the _Education Services for Overseas Students Act 2000_ (the **_ESOS Act_**) that a provider be registered under that Act to provide a course at a location to overseas students; and

     * (b) the provider meets the requirements in subsection 9AB(1) of that Act, other than the requirement in paragraph 9AB(1)(c); and

     * (c) at the time the provider meets those requirements, the provider is not registered to provide any course at any locations.

    * _Amount of the entry to market charges and due dates_

    * _	(2)	The provider is (subject to subsection (3) of this section) liable to pay 3 entry to market charges of the amount specified in column 1 by the time specified in column 2.

##### Entry to market charge

##### Item

##### Column 1

##### Amount of each charge

##### Column 2

##### Time by which each charge is payable

##### 1

##### $7,500

##### The time when the provider becomes registered to provide the course at the location under section 9AB of the ESOS Act

##### 2

##### $5,000

##### The end of the first anniversary of the day on which the provider was registered to provide the course at the location under section 9AB of the ESOS Act

##### 3

##### $2,500

##### The end of the second anniversary of the day on which the provider was registered to provide the course at the location under section 9AB of the ESOS Act

      * Note: The dollar amounts of the charges are indexed under section 7.

    * (3) A provider is liable to pay the second or third entry to market charge only if the provider is still registered to provide the course at the location on the relevant anniversary referred to in column 2 of table item 2 or 3.

    * _Exemptions from the charges_

    * _	(4)	The regulations may prescribe one or more classes of providers who are exempt from the requirement to pay the entry to market charges.

##### 7  Indexation of amounts

    * _Application of section_

    * _	(1)	This section applies for the purpose of working out the amount of an entry to market charge for a year (the **_current year_**) after the initial year.

    * (1A) This section also applies for the purpose of working out the amount of annual registration charge for any year (also called the **_current year_**) after the initial year, unless that year is the first year to which regulations made under paragraph 5(7)(a) apply.

      * Note: The reason for the exception is that the possibility of indexation for that year can be taken into account in making the regulations, so there is no need for this section to apply as well.

    * _Indexation formula_

    * _	(2)	The dollar amounts specified in subsection 5(2), in regulations made under paragraph 5(7)(a), or in column 1 of the table in subsection 6(2), are to be adjusted for the current year by multiplying the amounts that applied to the year before the current year by the indexation factor worked out using the formula:

    * where: 

    * **_index number_**, for a quarter, means the All Groups Consumer Price Index number that is the weighted average of the 8 capital cities and is published by the Australian Statistician for that quarter.

    * **_recent September quarter_** means the September quarter in the year before the current year.

    * **_previous September quarter_** means the September quarter before the recent September quarter.

    * _Rounding factors and amounts_

    * _	(3)	The indexation factor worked out under subsection (2) must be rounded up or down to 3 places (rounding up in the case of exactly halfway between).

    * (4) Amounts worked out under subsection (2) must be rounded to the nearest whole dollar (rounding up in the case of 50 cents).

    * _Changes to CPI_

    * _	(5)	If at any time (whether before or after the commencement of this section) the Australian Statistician has changed or changes the reference base for the Consumer Price Index, then, for the 
    * purposes of applying this section after the change, only index numbers published in terms of the new reference base are to be used.


    * _Definition of _**_initial year_**

    * _**	(6)	In this section, the **_initial year _**means the first calendar year in which the dollar amounts specified in subsection 5(2), and in the table in subsection 6(2), are imposed under section 8.

##### 8  Imposition of charges

    * The annual registration charge and the entry to market charges are imposed by this section.

##### 9  Regulations

    * The Governor-General may make regulations prescribing matters:

     * (a) required or permitted by this Act to be prescribed; or

     * (b) necessary or convenient to be prescribed for carrying out or giving effect to this Act.
