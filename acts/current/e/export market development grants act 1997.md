    * then, subject to subsection (4), the applicant's **_provisional grant amount_** for the grant year is the lesser of the following amounts:

     * (a) working out the amount that would be (under section 63 or 64) the provisional grant amount of each of the members of the related company group that have applied for a grant in respect of the grant year if this section did not apply to the member; and

#### Division 3--How to work out amount of grant

##### 66  Object of Division

    * This Division sets out how to work out the actual amount that an applicant entitled to a grant in respect of a grant year will receive.

##### 67  Amount of grant

    * (1) If an applicant is entitled to a grant in respect of a grant year, the amount of the grant is worked out in accordance with the following subsections.

    * (2) If the applicant's provisional grant amount for the grant year does not exceed the initial payment ceiling amount for the grant year, the amount of the grant is equal to the applicant's provisional grant amount.

    * (3) If the applicant's provisional grant amount for the grant year exceeds the initial payment ceiling amount for the grant year:

     * (a) multiply the amount of the excess by the payout factor for the grant year; and

     * (b) add the amount obtained under paragraph (a) to the initial payment ceiling amount.

    * The result is the amount of grant payable to the applicant for the grant year.

        * Note 1: For **_initial payment ceiling amount_**,**_ provisional grant amount _**and **_payout factor_** see section 107.

        * Note 2: The payout factor for the grant year will only be known after the balance distribution date for the year following the grant year (See subsections 69(1) and (2)).

#### Division 4--Initial payment ceiling amount, balance distribution date and payout factor

##### 68  Determination of initial payment ceiling amount etc.

    * (1) The Minister may, from time to time, determine in writing:

     * (a) the amount that is the initial payment ceiling amount for:

      * (i) the grant year (**_initial year_**) immediately preceding the year that is current when the determination comes into force; and

      * (ii) each grant year following the initial year; and

     * (b) the date:

      * (i) in the grant year that is current when the determination comes into force; and

      * (ii) in each subsequent grant year;

     * that is the balance distribution date for that year.

    * (2) The balance distribution date for the grant year that is current when the determination comes into force must be later than the date on which the determination comes into force.

    * (3) The Minister must cause the determination to be tabled in each House of the Parliament within 15 sitting days of that House after the determination is made.

##### 69  Payout factor

    * (1) For the purposes of subsection 67(3), the CEO of Austrade must, in respect of each grant year:

    * (2) The determination must be made as soon as practicable after the balance distribution date for the following year.

    * (3) The purpose, in applying the payout factor, is to ensure that the amount of each grant payable in respect of the grant year is capped at the appropriate level so that all payments of grant that become due in the year following the grant year are able to be met from the money available for that purpose.

    * (4) The regulations may prescribe the method for working out the factor that will be the payout factor for a grant year.
