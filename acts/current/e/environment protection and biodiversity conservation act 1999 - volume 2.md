## Chapter 5--Conservation of biodiversity and heritage

### Part 13--Species and communities

#### Division 5--Conservation advice, recovery plans, threat abatement plans and wildlife conservation plans

##### Subdivision AA--Approved conservation advice

##### 266B  Approved conservation advice for listed threatened species and listed threatened ecological communities

    * Minister to ensure there is approved conservation advice

    * (1) The Minister must ensure that there is approved conservation advice for each listed threatened species (except one that is extinct or that is a conservation dependent species), and each listed threatened ecological community, at all times while the species or community continues to be listed.

    * (2) For this purpose, **_approved conservation advice_** is a document, approved in writing by the Minister (and as changed from time to time in accordance with subsection (3)), that contains:

     * (a) a statement that sets out:

      * (i) the grounds on which the species or community is eligible to be included in the category in which it is listed; and

      * (ii) the main factors that are the cause of it being so eligible; and

     * (b) either:

      * (i) information about what could appropriately be done to stop the decline of, or support the recovery of, the species or community; or

      * (ii) a statement to the effect that there is nothing that could appropriately be done to stop the decline of, or support the recovery of, the species or community.

    * Changing approved conservation advice

    * (3) The Minister may, in writing, approve changes to approved conservation advice.

    * Consultation with Scientific Committee

    * (4) If the Minister proposes to approve a document as approved conservation advice, the Minister must consult the Scientific Committee about the document, unless its content is substantially the same as material that the Committee has previously provided to the Minister.

    * (5) If the Minister proposes to approve a change to approved conservation advice, the Minister must consult the Scientific Committee about the change, unless the change is substantially the same as a change that the Scientific Committee has previously advised the Minister should be made.

    * Publication requirements

    * (6) If the Minister approves a document as approved conservation advice, the Minister must:

     * (a) within 10 days of the approval of the document, publish the approved conservation advice on the internet; and

     * (b) comply with any other publication requirements of the regulations.

    * (7) If the Minister approves a change to approved conservation advice, the Minister must:

     * (a) within 10 days of the approval of the change, publish the advice, as changed, on the internet; and

     * (b) comply with any other publication requirements of the regulations.

    * Instruments of approval are not legislative instruments

    * (8) An instrument of approval under subsection (2) or (3) is not a legislative instrument.

##### Subdivision A--Recovery plans and threat abatement plans

##### 267  Simplified outline of this Subdivision

    * The following is a simplified outline of this Subdivision: 

    * Recovery plans for listed threatened species and ecological communities and threat abatement plans for key threatening processes bind the Commonwealth and Commonwealth agencies.

    * The Minister need ensure that a recovery plan is in force for a listed threatened species or ecological community only if the Minister decides to have a recovery plan. The Minister must decide whether to have a recovery plan for the species or community within 90 days after it becomes listed. The Minister may, at any other time, decide whether to have such a plan.

    * The Minister need ensure a threat abatement plan is in force for a key threatening process only if the Minister decides that a plan is a feasible, effective and efficient way of abating the process. The Minister must consult before making such a decision.

    * A recovery plan or threat abatement plan can be made by the Minister alone or jointly with relevant States and Territories, or the Minister can adopt a State or Territory plan. There must be public consultation and advice from the Scientific Committee about the plan, regardless of how it is made or adopted.

##### 268  Compliance with recovery plans and threat abatement plans

    * A Commonwealth agency must not take any action that contravenes a recovery plan or a threat abatement plan.

##### 269  Implementing recovery and threat abatement plans

    * (1) Subject to subsection (2), the Commonwealth must implement a recovery plan or threat abatement plan to the extent to which it applies in Commonwealth areas.

    * (2) If a recovery plan or a threat abatement plan applies outside Commonwealth areas in a particular State or selfgoverning Territory, the Commonwealth must seek the cooperation of the State or Territory with a view to implementing the plan jointly with the State or Territory to the extent to which the plan applies in the State or Territory.

##### 269AA  Decision whether to have a recovery plan

    * Minister has an initial obligation and then a discretion

    * (1) The Minister must decide whether to have a recovery plan for a listed threatened species (except one that is extinct or that is a conservation dependent species) or a listed threatened ecological community within 90 days after the species or community becomes listed. The Minister may, at any other time, decide whether to have a recovery plan for the species or community.

    * (2) In this section:

     * (a) the decision that the Minister is required by subsection (1) to make in relation to the species or community within the 90 day period referred to in that subsection is the **_initial recovery plan decision_**; and

     * (b) any subsequent decision that the Minister makes under subsection (1) in relation to the species or community is a **_subsequent recovery plan decision_**.

    * Making the initial recovery plan decision

    * (3) In making the initial recovery plan decision, the Minister must have regard to the recommendation (the **_initial recommendation_**) made by the Scientific Committee as mentioned in paragraph 189(1B)(c) in relation to the species or community.

    * Making a subsequent recovery plan decision (unless subsection (5) applies)

    * (4) In making a subsequent recovery plan decision in relation to the species or community, other than a decision to which subsection (5) applies:

     * (a) the Minister must have regard to the initial recommendation in relation to the species or community; and

     * (b) the Minister must have regard to any advice subsequently provided to the Minister by the Scientific Committee about whether there should be a recovery plan for the species or community.

    * Changing from a decision to have a recovery plan to a decision not to have a recovery plan--additional requirements

    * (5) If, at a time when a decision to have a recovery plan for the species or community is in force (whether or not the plan has yet been made), the Minister is proposing to make a subsequent recovery plan decision that there should not be a recovery plan for the species or community:

     * (a) the Minister must ask the Scientific Committee for advice relating to the proposed decision; and

     * (b) the Minister must publish a notice inviting comments on the proposed decision in accordance with subsection (7); and

     * (c) the Minister must, in deciding whether to make the proposed decision, take account of:

      * (i) any advice provided by the Scientific Committee in relation to the proposed decision; and

      * (ii) subject to subsection (6), the comments the Minister receives in response to the notice referred to in paragraph (b).

    * (6) The Minister is not required to take a comment referred to in subparagraph (5)(c)(ii) into account if:

     * (a) the Minister does not receive the comment until after the cutoff date specified in the notice under paragraph (5)(b); or

     * (b) the Minister considers that regulations referred to in paragraph (8)(b) have not been complied with in relation to the comment.

    * (7) The notice referred to in paragraph (5)(b):

     * (a) must be published in accordance with the regulations referred to in paragraph (8)(a); and

     * (b) must set out the decision the Minister proposed to make; and

     * (c) must invite people to make comments, to the Minister, about the proposed decision; and

     * (d) must specify the date (the **_cutoff date_**) by which comments must be received, which must be at least 30 business days after the notice has been published as required by paragraph (a); and

     * (e) must specify, or refer to, the manner and form requirements that, under regulations referred to in paragraph (8)(b), apply to making comments; and

     * (f) may also include any other information that the Minister considers appropriate.

    * (8) The regulations must provide for the following:

     * (a) how a notice referred to in paragraph (5)(b) is to be published;

##### Subdivision BB--Inclusion of places in the National Heritage List: emergency process

##### 324JK  Simplified outline

    * The following is a simplified outline of this Subdivision: 

    * This Subdivision sets out the emergency process for the inclusion of places in the National Heritage List.

    * The emergency process involves the following steps: 

        * (a) the Minister may include a place in the National Heritage List if it is under threat (see section 324JL);

        * (b) the Minister asks the Australian Heritage Council to assess the place (see section 324JM);

        * (c) the Australian Heritage Council publishes notice of the listing and invites comments (see section 324JN);

        * (d) the Australian Heritage Council assesses the place, and gives the assessment to the Minister (see sections 324JO and 324JP);

        * (e) the Minister has 12 months from the listing of the place to decide whether it should continue to be listed, and the listing will lapse if the Minister does not make a decision within that period (see section 324JQ).

##### 324JL  Minister may include place in National Heritage List if under threat

    * (1) If the Minister believes that:

     * (a) a place has or may have one or more National Heritage values; and

     * (a) the place is included in the National Heritage List under subsection (1); and

     * (b) before that inclusion of the place, the place was being considered for inclusion in the List under the process set out in Subdivision BA;

    * that process ceases to apply to the place when it is included in the List under subsection (1).

        * Note: Subsection (2) does not prevent the process in Subdivision BA again starting to apply to the place if (for example) the place ceases to be listed because of subsection 324JQ(1) or (4) and a person subsequently nominates the place under that Subdivision.

    * (3) If the place is included in the National Heritage List under subsection (1), the Minister must:

     * (a) within 10 business days after the inclusion of the place, publish a copy of the instrument under subsection (1):

      * (ii) advise each person identified that the place has been included in the National Heritage List.

    * (4) If the Minister is satisfied that there are likely to be at least 50 persons referred to in subparagraph (3)(b)(i), the Minister may satisfy the requirements of paragraph (3)(b) in relation to those persons by including the advice referred to in that paragraph in one or more of the following:

     * (a) advertisements in a newspaper, or newspapers, circulating in the area in which the place is located;

        * Note: When specifying an assessment completion time, the 12month period referred to in subsection 324JQ(1) should be considered.

##### 324JN  Publication of listing of place and inviting comments

    * (1) If the Australian Heritage Council receives a request under subsection 324JM(1) in relation to a place that has been included in the National Heritage List, the Council must publish a notice inviting people to comment on the listing of the place.

    * (2) The proposed priority assessment list is to consist of such of the places that are eligible for assessment consideration in relation to the assessment period as the Australian Heritage Council considers it appropriate to include in the list, having regard to:

     * (a) the Council's own views about what should be given priority in relation to the assessment period; and

     * (b) the Council's capacity to make assessments under this Division while still performing its other functions; and

     * (c) any other matters that the Council considers appropriate.

    * (3) A place is **_eligible for assessment consideration _**in relation to the assessment period if:

     * (a) the place has been nominated by a nomination referred to in subsection (1); or

     * (b) the Council itself wishes to nominate the place for inclusion in the Commonwealth Heritage List; or

     * (b) for each place that is not included in the list but that was eligible for assessment consideration because of paragraph 341JA(3)(a) or (c)--why the Council did not include the place in the list.

    * (2) The statement must also identify, as places nominated by the Australian Heritage Council:

     * (a) any places that are included in the list because the Council itself wishes to nominate them (see paragraph 341JA(3)(b)); and

     * (b) any places that are included in the list because of paragraph 341JA(3)(d) that consist of one or more places to which paragraph 341JA(3)(b) applies.

    * whichever happens first.

    * (1B) As soon as practicable after the end of the period (the **_retention period_**) during which the thing may be retained under subsection (1A), the Secretary must cause reasonable steps to be taken to return the thing to the person from whom it was seized (or to the owner if that person is not entitled to possess it).

    * (3A) Before an authorised officer makes an application under subsection (2), he or she must:

     * (a) take reasonable steps to discover who has an interest in the retention of the thing; and

     * (b) if it is practicable to do so, give notice in writing of the proposed application to each person whom the authorised officer believes to have an interest in the proposed application.

    * (4) Subsection (3) does not prevent a magistrate from granting 2 or more successive extensions under that subsection of the period during which the thing may be retained.

    * (5) A function of making an order conferred on a magistrate by subsection (3) is conferred on the magistrate in a personal capacity and not as a court or a member of a court.

    * (1) This section applies if a thing, or anything in, on or attached to a thing, seized under this Part is released on conditions to a person under section 449BA.

    * (2) Subject to this section, the provisions of this Part that apply in relation to things seized under the seizure provision continue to apply to the released thing as if it had not been released.

    * (3) A reference in a provision of this Part to the return or delivery of the released thing to a person is, if the person is the person to whom the thing has been released, taken to be a reference to making the release of the thing to the person unconditional.

    * (4) The regulations may specify modifications of provisions of this Part that are to have effect in relation to things to which this section applies. However, regulations must not:

    * the court may order the forfeiture to the Commonwealth of the specimen.

    * (4) A reference in this section to an offence against an environmental law does not include an offence against Part VIIA of the _Great Barrier Reef Marine Park Act 1975_ (compulsory pilotage).

     * (c) the court to which the Secretary applies is satisfied that there are reasonable grounds for suspecting that, if the specimen were released to the person from whom it was seized or to its owner, the possession of the specimen by that person would contravene a provision of an environmental law.

    * (3) A reference in this section to an offence against an environmental law does not include an offence against Part VIIA of the _Great Barrier Reef Marine Park Act 1975_ (compulsory pilotage).

     * (c) the authorised officer considers that it is not reasonably practicable to seize the seizable thing without also seizing the cage or container.

    * (2) For the purpose of seizing the seizable thing and despite any other provision of this Part, the authorised officer may seize the cage or container containing the seizable thing (whether or not the cage or container also contains any other thing).

    * (3) The seizure of the seizable thing is taken to occur under the provision mentioned in paragraph (1)(a) (not under this section).

        * Note: The provisions governing the retention and return of the seizable thing are therefore the provisions that usually govern the seizure of a thing under the provision mentioned in paragraph (1)(a).

     * (a) an authorised officer seizes a cage or container; and

     * (b) the seizure of the cage or container is authorised by this section, and is also authorised by another provision of this Part;

     * (c) the cage or container has been dealt with under this Part, or as otherwise authorised (by a law, or an order of a court, of the Commonwealth or of a State or Territory), in a way that means the Secretary is not in a position to cause reasonable steps to be taken to return the cage or container; or

     * (d) the Commonwealth, the Secretary or an authorised officer is otherwise authorised (by a law, or an order of a court, of the Commonwealth or of a State or Territory) to retain, destroy, dispose of or otherwise deal with the cage or container.

    * (5) If, because of paragraph (4)(a), the cage or container does not have to be returned at the end of the period referred to in subsection (3), this Part then applies in relation to the cage or container as if, at the end of that period, it had been seized under the other seizure provision.

     * (b) the nonseizable thing has been dealt with under this Part, or as otherwise authorised (by a law, or an order of a court, of the Commonwealth or of a State or Territory), in a way that means the Secretary is not in a position to cause reasonable steps to be taken to return the thing; or

     * (c) the Commonwealth, the Secretary or an authorised officer is otherwise authorised (by a law, or an order of a court, of the Commonwealth or of a State or Territory) to retain, destroy, dispose of or otherwise deal with the nonseizable thing.

##### 460  Nature of directed environmental audit

    * (1) If:

     * (a) an environmental auditor carries out a directed environmental audit; and

     * (b) in the course of carrying out the audit, the auditor does not deal with a particular matter; and

     * (c) the matter is specified in the Minister's notice under section 458 as a matter that is to be covered by the audit;

    * (4) The third main object is to facilitate the transition of persons from environment detention to immigration detention under the _Migration Act 1958_:

     * (a) by providing for the things mentioned in subclause (3) to be done in a way corresponding to the way that Act provides for those things to be done to persons in immigration detention; and

     * (b) by authorising the disclosure of personal information about individuals who are or have been in environment detention to persons, agencies and organisations responsible for holding the individuals in immigration detention, for the purpose of the immigration detention and welfare of the individuals.

        * Note: The enforcement visa of a person who is neither an Australian citizen nor an Australian resident ceases to have effect under the _Migration Act 1958_ when the person ceases to be in environment detention, so that Act requires the person to be taken into immigration detention.
