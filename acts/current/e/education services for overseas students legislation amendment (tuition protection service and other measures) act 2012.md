##### 45  Guide to this Part

      *  	This Part sets out what happens when a registered provider or an overseas student or intending overseas student defaults (that is, when a provider fails to start or finish providing a course to a student, or a student fails to start or finish a course with a provider).

      *  	Under Division 4, payments can be made out of the Overseas Students Tuition Fund to refund students, and to reimburse providers who provide students with alternative courses, when a provider has failed to discharge its obligations. (This is called making a call on the OSTF.)

     * (1) If a call is made on the OSTF, then, as soon as practicable, the TPS Director must pay out of the OSTF an amount equal to the amount that the provider must still pay in order to satisfy the refund requirements under Division 2.

        * Note: The TPS Director pays the amount to the person specified in subsection (3).

     * (2) If the student accepts a place in an alternative course in accordance with section 49, the TPS Director may spend more than the amount of that refund entitlement if the TPS Director considers that to do so:

      * (a) the TPS Director is required under subsection (3) to pay a registered provider for providing an alternative course; and

     * Provider must pay back TPS Director

     * (2) Instead, the provider must pay the TPS Director an amount equal to the amount that the TPS Director paid under section 50B.

        * Note: For providers who are required to maintain an initial prepaid fees account, the amount might be paid out of the account: see section 29.

     * (5) This section continues to apply to a provider if the provider ceases to be a registered provider.

##### 50D  TPS Director to notify Immigration Secretary

##### 7B  Guide to this Act

      *  	This Act regulates providers who provide courses to overseas students.

      *  	A person who provides a course at a location to an overseas student must be registered to provide that course at that location (or do so in accordance with an arrangement with a provider who is so registered).

      *  	This Act and the national code impose obligations on registered providers, such as notification, record keeping and financial requirements.

      *  	In particular, there are obligations on registered providers when the provider or an overseas student of the provider defaults, and does not start or finish a course. The provider is required to provide a refund to the student. For a provider default, the provider may instead provide an alternative course for the student at the provider's expense.

      *  	If a provider that has defaulted does not discharge its obligations to an overseas student, the TPS Director must provide the student with options for suitable alternative courses (if any such courses are available).

      *  	In the case of a default, a call is made on the Overseas Students Tuition Fund to pay for alternative courses, or to provide refunds to students, if providers have not already done so.

It is also an offence for a registered provider to offer courses, or hold itself out as able to provide a course, to overseas students without being appropriately registered (or doing so in accordance with an appropriate arrangement).

      *  	Approved providers are registered under Division 3. A provider's registration lists all of the courses that the provider is registered to provide, and the locations at which the provider is registered to provide those courses. Conditions can be imposed on a provider's registration. A registration lasts for a minimum of 2 and a maximum of 5 years.
