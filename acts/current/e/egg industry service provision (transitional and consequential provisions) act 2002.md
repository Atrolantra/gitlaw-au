At the transfer time particular assets and liabilities of the Rural Industries Research and Development Corporation are transferred to the industry services body (see sections 10 and 11). Transfers are not subject to taxation (see sections 12). Other transitional matters (such as the transfer of records) are also dealt with.

    * (a) a declaration that the asset vests in the transferee at the transfer time without any conveyance, transfer or assignment;
