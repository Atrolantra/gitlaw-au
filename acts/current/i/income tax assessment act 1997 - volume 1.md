### An Act about income tax and related matters

## Chapter 1--Introduction and core provisions

### Part 11--Preliminary

#### Division 1--Preliminary

##### Table of sections

       * 11	Short title

       * 12	Commencement

       * 13	Differences in style not to affect meaning

       * 1-4	Application

       * 17	Administration of this Act

##### 11  Short title

    * This Act may be cited as the _Income Tax Assessment Act 1997_.

##### 12  Commencement

    * This Act commences on 1 July 1997.

##### 13  Differences in style not to affect meaning

    * (1) This Act contains provisions of the _Income Tax Assessment Act 1936_ in a rewritten form. 

    * (2) If:

      * (a) that Act expressed an idea in a particular form of words; and

      * (b) this Act appears to have expressed the same idea in a different form of words in order to use a clearer or simpler style;

    * the ideas are not to be taken to be different just because different forms of words were used.

          * Note: A public or private ruling about a provision of the _Income Tax Assessment Act 1936_ is taken also to be a ruling about the corresponding provision of this Act, so far as the 2 provisions express the same ideas: see section 35785 in Schedule 1 to the _Taxation Administration Act 1953_.

##### 14  Application

    * This Act extends to every external Territory referred to in the definition of **_Australia_**.

##### 17  Administration of this Act

    * The Commissioner has the general administration of this Act.

          * Note: An effect of this provision is that people who acquire information under this Act are subject to the confidentiality obligations and exceptions in Division 355 in Schedule 1 to the _Taxation Administration Act 1953_.

### Part 12--A Guide to this Act

#### Division 2--How to use this Act

##### Table of Subdivisions

      * 2A	How to find your way around

      * 2B	How the Act is arranged

      * 2C	How to identify defined terms and find the definitions

      * 2D	The numbering system

      * 2E	Status of Guides and other nonoperative material

##### Subdivision 2A--How to find your way around

##### 21  The design

    * This Act is designed to help you identify accurately and quickly the provisions that are relevant to your purpose in reading the income tax law.

    * The Act contains tables, diagrams and signposts to help you navigate your way.

    * You can start at Division 3 (What this Act is about) and follow the signposts as far into the Act as you need to go. You may also encounter signposts to several areas of the law that are relevant to you. Each one should be followed.

    * Sometimes they will lead down through several levels of detail. At each successive level, the rules are structured in a similar way. They will often be preceded by a Guide to the rules at that level. The rules themselves will usually deal first with the general or most common case and then with the more particular or special cases. 

##### Subdivision 2B--How the Act is arranged

##### 25  The pyramid

    * This Act is arranged in a way that reflects the principle of moving from the general case to the particular.

    * In this respect, the conceptual structure of the Act is something like a pyramid. The pyramid shape illustrates the way the income tax law is organised, moving down from the central or core provisions at the top of the pyramid, to general rules of wide application and then to the more specialised topics.

          * Note: The _Taxation Administration Act 1953_ contains the provisions on collection and recovery of tax and provisions on administration.

##### Subdivision 2C--How to identify defined terms and find the definitions

##### Table of sections

       * 210	When defined terms are identified

       * 215	When terms are _not_ identified

       * 220	Identifying the defined term in a definition

##### 210  When defined terms are identified

    * (1) Many of the terms used in the income tax law are defined.

    * (2) Most defined terms in this Act are identified by an asterisk appearing at the start of the term: as in "*business". The footnote that goes with the asterisk contains a signpost to the Dictionary definitions starting at section 9951.

##### 215  When terms are not identified

    * (1) Once a defined term has been identified by an asterisk, later occurrences of the term in the same subsection are _not_ usually asterisked.

    * (2) Terms are _not_ asterisked in the nonoperative material contained in this Act.

          * Note: The nonoperative material is described in Subdivision 2E.

    * (3) The following basic terms used throughout the Act are _not_ identified with an asterisk. They fall into 2 groups:

    * Key participants in the income tax system

    * Core concepts

##### 220  Identifying the defined term in a definition

    * Within a definition, the defined term is identified by **_bold italics_**.

##### Subdivision 2D--The numbering system

##### Table of sections

       * 225	Purposes

       * 230	Gaps in the numbering

##### 225  Purposes

    * Two main purposes of the numbering system in this Act are: 

       * To indicate the relationship between units at different levels.

          * For example, the number of Part 215 indicates that the Part is in Chapter 2. Similarly, the number of section 16570 indicates that the section is in Division 165.

       * To allow for future expansion of the Act. The main technique here is leaving gaps between numbers.

##### 230  Gaps in the numbering

    * There are gaps in the numbering system to allow for the insertion of new Divisions and sections.

##### Subdivision 2E--Status of Guides and other nonoperative material

##### Table of sections

       * 235	Nonoperative material

       * 240	Guides

       * 245	Other material

##### 235  Nonoperative material

    * In addition to the operative provisions themselves, this Act contains other material to help you identify accurately and quickly the provisions that are relevant to you and to help you understand them.

    * This other material falls into 2 main categories.

##### 240  Guides

    * The first is the "Guides". A **_Guide_** consists of sections under a heading indicating that what follows is a Guide to a particular Subdivision, Division etc.

    * Guides form part of this Act but are kept separate from the operative provisions. In interpreting an operative provision, a Guide may only be considered for limited purposes. These are set out in section 950150.

##### 245  Other material

    * The other category consists of material such as notes and examples. These also form part of the Act. They are distinguished by type size from the operative provisions, but are not kept separate from them.

#### Division 3--What this Act is about

##### Table of sections

       * 35	Annual income tax

       * 310	Your other obligations as a taxpayer

       * 315	Your obligations _other than_ as a taxpayer

##### 35  Annual income tax

    * (1) Income tax is payable for each year by each individual and company, and by some other entities.

          * Note 1: Individuals who are Australian residents, and some trustees, are also liable to pay Medicare levy for each year. See the _Medicare Levy Act 1986_ and Part VIIB of the _Income Tax Assessment Act 1936_.

          * Note 2: Income tax is imposed by the _Income Tax Act 1986_ and the other Acts referred to in the definition of **_income tax_** in section 9951.

    * (2) Most entities have to pay _instalments_ of income tax before the income tax they _actually_ have to pay can be worked out.

       * 425	Special provisions for working out your basic income tax liability

##### 41  Who must pay income tax

    * Income tax is payable by each individual and company, and by some other entities.

          * Note: The actual amount of income tax payable may be nil.

          * For a list of the entities that must pay income tax,
          * see Division 9, starting at section 91.


##### 45  Meaning of you

    * If a provision of this Act uses the expression **_you_**, it applies to entities generally, unless its application is expressly limited.

          * Note 1: The expression **_you_** is not used in provisions that apply only to entities that are not individuals.

          * Note 2: For circumstances in which the identity of an entity that is a managed investment scheme for the purposes of the _Corporations Act 2001_ is not affected by changes to the scheme, see Subdivision 960E of the _Income Tax (Transitional Provisions) Act 1997_.

##### 410  How to work out how much income tax you must pay

    * (1) You must pay income tax for each *financial year.

    * (2) Your income tax is worked out by reference to your taxable income for the **_income year_**. The income year is the same as the *financial year, except in these cases:

      * (a) for a company, the income year is the _previous_ financial year;

      * (b) if you have an accounting period that is not the same as the financial year, each such accounting period or, for a company, each previous accounting period is an income year.

          * Note 1: The Commissioner can allow you to adopt an accounting period ending on a day other than 30 June. See section 18 of the _Income Tax Assessment Act 1936_.

          * Note 2: An accounting period ends, and a new accounting period starts, when a partnership becomes, or ceases to be, a VCLP, an ESVCLP, an AFOF or a VCMP. See section 18A of the _Income Tax Assessment Act 1936_.

    * (3) Work out your income tax for the *financial year as follows:

Method statement

        * Step 1.	Work out your taxable income for the income year.

     * To do this, see section 415.

        * Step 2.	Work out your basic income tax liability on your taxable income using:

          * (a) the income tax rate or rates that apply to you for the income year; and

          * (b) any special provisions that apply to working out that liability.

     * See the_ Income Tax Rates Act 1986 _and section 425.

        * Step 3.	Work out your tax offsets for the income year. A **_tax offset_** reduces the amount of income tax you have to pay.

     * For the list of tax offsets, see section 131.

        * Step 4.	Subtract your *tax offsets from your basic income tax liability. The result is how much income tax you owe for the *financial year.

          * Note 1: Division 63 explains what happens if your tax offsets exceed your basic income tax liability. How the excess is treated depends on the type of tax offset.

          * Note 2: In addition to the income tax worked out under this section, you may also have to pay additional income tax (known as temporary flood and cyclone reconstruction levy) for the 201112 financial year. See section 410 of the _Income Tax (Transitional Provisions) Act 1997_.

          * Note 3: Section 411 of the _Income Tax (Transitional Provisions) Act 1997_ (which is about the temporary budget repair levy) may increase the amount of income tax worked out under this section.

    * Income tax worked out on another basis

    * (4) For some entities, some or all of their income tax for the *financial year is worked out by reference to something other than taxable income for the income year.

          * See section 95.

##### 415  How to work out your taxable income

    * (1) Work out your **_taxable income_** for the income year like this:

Method statement

        * Step 1.	Add up all your assessable income for the income year.

     * To find out about your assessable income, see Division 6. 

        * Step 2.	Add up your deductions for the income year.

     * To find out what you can deduct, see Division 8.

        * Step 3.	Subtract your deductions from your assessable income (unless they exceed it). The result is your taxable income. (If the deductions equal or exceed the assessable income, you don't have a taxable income.)

          * Note: If the deductions exceed the assessable income, you may have a tax loss which you may be able to utilise in that or a later income year: see Division 36.

    * (2) There are cases where taxable income is worked out in a special way:

          * Note: A life insurance company can have a taxable income of the complying superannuation/FHSA class and/or a taxable income of the ordinary class for the purposes of working out its income tax for an income year: see Subdivision 320D.

##### 425  Special provisions for working out your basic income tax liability

    * The following provisions may increase your basic income tax liability beyond the liability worked out simply by applying the income tax rates to your taxable income: 

      * (a) Subdivision 355G;

      * (b) subsection 39235(3).

          * Note 1: Subdivision 355G increases some entities' tax liability by requiring them to pay extra income tax on government recoupments relating to R&D activities for which entitlements to tax offsets arise under Division 355.

          * Note 2: Subsection 39235(3) increases some primary producers' tax liability by requiring them to pay extra income tax on their averaging components worked out under Subdivision 392C.

##### Guide to Division 5

##### 51  What this Division is about

    * If your assessed income tax liability exceeds the credits available to you under the PAYG system, this Division explains _when_ you must pay the excess to the Commissioner.

    * If your assessment is amended so that you must pay income tax, or pay more income tax than under the previous assessment, this Division explains:

          * (a) _when_ you must pay the additional tax; and

          * (b) _when_ any associated interest charges must be paid.

              * Note: For provisions about the collection and recovery of income tax and other taxrelated liabilities, see Part 415 in Schedule 1 to the _Taxation Administration Act 1953_.

##### Subdivision 5A--How to work out when to pay your income tax

##### Table of sections

       * 55	When income tax is payable

       * 510	When shortfall interest charge is payable

       * 515	General interest charge payable on unpaid income tax or shortfall interest charge

##### 55  When income tax is payable

    * Scope

    * (1) This section tells you when income tax you must pay for a *financial year is due and payable.

          * Note: The Commissioner may defer the time at which the income tax is due and payable: see section 25510 in Schedule 1 to the _Taxation Administration Act 1953_.

    * (2) The income tax is only due and payable if the Commissioner makes an *assessment of your income tax for the year.

    * (3) However, if the Commissioner does make an *assessment of your income tax for the year, the tax may be taken to have been due and payable at a time before your assessment was made.

          * Note: This is to ensure that general interest charge begins to accrue from the same date for all like entities. General interest charge on unpaid income tax is calculated from when the tax is due and payable, not from when the assessment is made: see section 515.

    * Original assessments--selfassessment entities

    * (4) If you are a *selfassessment entity, the income tax is due and payable on the first day of the sixth month after the end of the income year.

          * Example: If your income year is the same as the financial year, your income tax would be due and payable on 1 December.

    * Original assessments--other entities

    * (5) If you are _not_ a *selfassessment entity, the income tax is due and payable 21 days after the day (the **_return day_**) on or before which you are required to lodge your *income tax return with the Commissioner.

          * Note: For rules about income tax returns and when they are due, see Part IV of the _Income Tax Assessment Act 1936_.

    * (6) However, if you lodge your return _on or before_ the return day and the Commissioner gives you a notice of *assessment (other than an amended assessment) _after_ the return day, the income tax is due and payable 21 days after the Commissioner gives you the notice.

    * Amended assessments

    * (7) If the Commissioner amends your *assessment, any extra income tax resulting from the amendment is due and payable 21 days after the day on which the Commissioner gives you notice of the amended assessment.

          * Note: Shortfall interest charge may be payable, on any amount of extra income tax payable as a result of the amended assessment, for each day in the period that:

           * (a) starts at the time income tax was due and payable on your original assessment; and

           * (b) ends the day before the day on which the Commissioner gives you notice of the amended assessment.

##### 510  When shortfall interest charge is payable

    * An amount of *shortfall interest charge that you are liable to pay is due and payable 21 days after the day on which the Commissioner gives you notice of the charge.

          * Note: Shortfall interest charge is imposed if the Commissioner amends an assessment and the amended assessment results in an increase in some tax payable. For provisions about liability for shortfall interest charge, see Division 280 in Schedule 1 to the _Taxation Administration Act 1953_.

##### 515  General interest charge payable on unpaid income tax or shortfall interest charge

    * If an amount of income tax or *shortfall interest charge that you are liable to pay remains unpaid after the time by which it is due to be paid, you are liable to pay the *general interest charge on the unpaid amount for each day in the period that:

      * (a) starts at the beginning of the day on which the amount was due to be paid; and

      * (b) finishes at the end of the last day on which, at the end of the day, any of the following remains unpaid:

        * (i) the income tax or shortfall interest charge;

        * (ii) general interest charge on any of the income tax or shortfall interest charge.

          * Note 1: The general interest charge is worked out under Part IIA of the _Taxation Administration Act 1953_.

          * Note 2: Shortfall interest charge is worked out under Division 280 in Schedule 1 to that Act.

       * 65	Income according to ordinary concepts (_ordinary income_)

       * 610	Other assessable income (_statutory income_)

       * 620	Exempt income

       * 623	Nonassessable nonexempt income

       * 625	Relationships among various rules about ordinary income

##### 61  Diagram showing relationships among concepts in this Division

    * (1) Assessable income consists of ordinary income and statutory income.

    * (2) Some ordinary income, and some statutory income, is exempt income.

    * (3) Exempt income is not assessable income.

    * (4) Some ordinary income, and some statutory income, is neither assessable income nor exempt income.

          * For the effect of the GST in working out assessable income, see Division 17.

    * (5) An amount of ordinary income or statutory income can have only one status (that is, assessable income, exempt income or nonassessable nonexempt income) in the hands of a particular entity.

##### Operative provisions

##### 65  Income according to ordinary concepts (ordinary income)

    * (1) Your **_assessable income_** includes income according to ordinary concepts, which is called **_ordinary income_**.

          * Note: Some of the provisions about assessable income listed in section 105 may affect the treatment of ordinary income.

    * (2) If you are an Australian resident, your assessable income includes the *ordinary income you *derived directly or indirectly from all sources, whether in or out of Australia, during the income year.

    * (3) If you are a foreign resident, your assessable income includes:

      * (a) the *ordinary income you *derived directly or indirectly from all *Australian sources during the income year; and

      * (b) other *ordinary income that a provision includes in your assessable income for the income year on some basis other than having an *Australian source.

    * (4) In working out whether you have **_derived_** an amount of *ordinary income, and (if so) when you **_derived_** it, you are taken to have received the amount as soon as it is applied or dealt with in any way on your behalf or as you direct.

##### 610  Other assessable income (statutory income)

    * (1) Your **_assessable income_** also includes some amounts that are _not _*ordinary income. 

          * Note: These are included by provisions about assessable income.
          * For a summary list of these provisions, see section 105.


    * (2) Amounts that are _not _*ordinary income, but are included in your assessable income by provisions about assessable income, are called **_statutory income_**.

          * Note 1: Although an amount is statutory income because it has been included in assessable income under a provision of this Act, it may be made exempt income or nonassessable nonexempt income under another provision: see sections 620 and 623.

          * Note 2: Many provisions in the summary list in section 105 contain rules about ordinary income. These rules do not change its character as ordinary income.

    * (3) If an amount would be *statutory income apart from the fact that you have not received it, it becomes statutory income as soon as it is applied or dealt with in any way on your behalf or as you direct.

    * (4) If you are an Australian resident, your assessable income includes your *statutory income from all sources, whether in or out of Australia.

    * (5) If you are a foreign resident, your assessable income includes:

      * (a) your *statutory income from all *Australian sources; and

      * (b) other *statutory income that a provision includes in your assessable income on some basis other than having an *Australian source.

##### 615  What is not assessable income

    * (1) If an amount is _not _*ordinary income, and is _not _*statutory income, it is not **_assessable income_** (so you do not have to pay income tax on it).

    * (2) If an amount is *exempt income, it is not **_assessable income_**.

          * Note: If an amount is exempt income, there are other consequences besides it being exempt from income tax. For example:

the amount may be taken into account in working out the amount of a tax loss (see section 3610);

you cannot deduct as a general deduction a loss or outgoing incurred in deriving the amount (see Division 8);

capital gains and losses on assets used solely to produce exempt income are disregarded (see section 11812).

    * (3) If an amount is *nonassessable nonexempt income, it is not **_assessable income_**.

          * Note 1: You cannot deduct as a general deduction a loss or outgoing incurred in deriving an amount of nonassessable nonexempt income (see Division 8).

          * Note 2: Capital gains and losses on assets used to produce _some_ types of nonassessable nonexempt income are disregarded (see section 11812).

##### 620  Exempt income

    * (1) An amount of *ordinary income or *statutory income is **_exempt income_** if it is made exempt from income tax by a provision of this Act or another *Commonwealth law.

          * For summary lists of provisions about exempt income,
          * see sections 115 and 1115.


    * (2) *Ordinary income is also **_exempt income_** to the extent that this Act excludes it (expressly or by implication) from being assessable income.

    * (3) By contrast, an amount of *statutory income is **_exempt income _**only if it is made exempt from income tax by a provision of this Act outside this Division or another *Commonwealth law.

    * (4) If an amount of *ordinary income or *statutory income is *nonassessable nonexempt income, it is not **_exempt income_**.

          * Note: An amount of nonassessable nonexempt income is not taken into account in working out the amount of a tax loss.

##### 623  Nonassessable nonexempt income

    * An amount of *ordinary income or *statutory income is **_nonassessable nonexempt income_** if a provision of this Act or of another *Commonwealth law states that it is not assessable income and is not *exempt income.

          * Note: Capital gains and losses on assets used to produce _some_ types of nonassessable nonexempt income are disregarded (see section 11812).

          * For a summary list of provisions about nonassessable nonexempt income, see Subdivision 11B.

##### 625  Relationships among various rules about ordinary income 

    * (1) Sometimes more than one rule includes an amount in your assessable income:

       * the same amount may be *ordinary income and may also be included in your assessable income by one or more provisions about assessable income; or

       * the same amount may be included in your assessable income by more than one provision about assessable income.

          * For a summary list of the provisions about assessable income,
          *  see section 105.


    * However, the amount is included only once in your assessable income for an income year, and is then not included in your assessable income for any other income year. 

    * (2) Unless the contrary intention appears, the provisions of this Act (outside this Part) prevail over the rules about *ordinary income.

          * Note: This Act contains some specific provisions about how far the rules about ordinary income prevail over the other provisions of this Act. 

#### Division 8--Deductions 

##### Table of sections 

       * 81	General deductions

       * 85	Specific deductions

       * 810	No double deductions

##### 81  General deductions

    * (1) You can **_deduct_** from your assessable income any loss or outgoing to the extent that:

      * (a) it is incurred in gaining or producing your assessable income; or

      * (b) it is necessarily incurred in carrying on a *business for the purpose of gaining or producing your assessable income.

          * Note: Division 35 prevents losses from noncommercial business activities that may contribute to a tax loss being offset against other assessable income.

    * (2) However, you cannot deduct a loss or outgoing under this section to the extent that:

      * (a) it is a loss or outgoing of capital, or of a capital nature; or

      * (b) it is a loss or outgoing of a private or domestic nature; or

      * (c) it is incurred in relation to gaining or producing your *exempt income or your *nonassessable nonexempt income; or

      * (d) a provision of this Act prevents you from deducting it.

          * For a summary list of provisions about deductions, see section 125.

    * (3) A loss or outgoing that you can deduct under this section is called a **_general deduction_**.

          * For the effect of the GST in working out deductions, see Division 27.

          * Note	If you receive an amount as insurance, indemnity or other recoupment of a loss or outgoing that you can deduct under this section, the amount may be included in your assessable income: see Subdivision 20A.

##### 85  Specific deductions

    * (1) You can also **_deduct_** from your assessable income an amount that a provision of this Act (outside this Division) allows you to deduct.

    * (2) Some provisions of this Act prevent you from deducting an amount that you could otherwise deduct, or limit the amount you can deduct.

    * (3) An amount that you can deduct under a provision of this Act (outside this Division) is called a **_specific deduction_**.

          * Note: If you receive an amount as insurance, indemnity or other recoupment of a deductible expense, the amount may be included in your assessable income: see Subdivision 20A.

          * For a summary list of provisions about deductions, see section 125.

##### 810  No double deductions

    * If 2 or more provisions of this Act allow you deductions in respect of the same amount (whether for the same income year or different income years), you can deduct only under the provision that is most appropriate.

            * only to the extent of your total deductions to date for the loss or outgoing.

Method statement

        * Step 1.	Add up all the *assessable recoupments of the loss or outgoing that you have received (in the *current year or earlier). The result is the**_ total assessable recoupment_**.

        * Step 2.	Add up the amounts (if any) included in your assessable income for earlier income years, in respect of the loss or outgoing, by this section or a *previous recoupment law. The result is the**_ recoupment already assessed_**. (If no amount was included, the**_ recoupment already assessed_** is nil.)

        * Step 3.	Subtract the recoupment already assessed from the total assessable recoupment. The result is the**_ unassessed recoupment_**.

        * Step 4.	Add up each amount that you can deduct for the loss or outgoing for the *current year, or you have deducted or can deduct for the loss or outgoing for an earlier income year. The result is the **_total deductions for the loss or outgoing_**.

             * Note: The total deductions may be reduced if an amount has been included in your assessable income because of a balancing adjustment: see section 2045.

        * Step 5.	Subtract the recoupment already assessed from the total deductions for the loss or outgoing. The result is the**_ outstanding deductions_**.

        * Step 6.	The unassessed recoupment is included in your assessable income, unless it is greater than the outstanding deductions. In that case, the amount of the outstanding deductions is included instead.

          * Example: At the start of the 200203 income year, a company incurs $100,000 to start to hold a depreciating asset. The company uses the prime cost method, and the effective life is 10 years. $10,000 is deductible for the 200203 income year and for each of the following 9 income years under section 4025.

          * In the 200203 income year, the company receives $20,000 as recoupment. How much is assessable for the 200203 income year?

          * Applying the method statement: 

          *  After step 1: the total assessable recoupment is $20,000.

          *  After step 2: the recoupment already assessed is nil.

          *  After step 3: the unassessed recoupment is: 
          * total assessable recoupment minus recoupment already assessed,
          * i.e. $20,000 minus 0 = $20,000.


          *  After step 4: the total deductions for the loss or outgoing are $10,000.

          *  After step 5: the outstanding deductions are: 
          * total deductions for the loss or outgoing minus recoupment already assessed, i.e. $10,000 minus 0 = $10,000.


          *  After step 6: the unassessed recoupment (step 3) is greater than outstanding deductions (step 5), so the amount of the outstanding deductions is included in assessable income, i.e. $10,000.

          *  Applying the method statement to the 200304 income year: a further $10,000 is included in the company's assessable income.

##### 2045  Effect of balancing charge

    * (1) This section may affect the operation of section 2035 or 2040 (as appropriate) if:

      * (a) a balancing adjustment is required for the *current year (or for an earlier income year) because you have deducted or can deduct an amount for an income year for the loss or outgoing; and

      * (b) an amount (the **_balancing charge_**) is included in your assessable income for the *current year (or for the earlier income year) because of the balancing adjustment.

          * To find out about balancing adjustments, see Subdivision 40D. 

    * Effect on section 2035

    * (2) In applying section 2035, treat each of the following as reduced by the balancing charge:

      * (a) the amount of the loss or outgoing; 

      * (b) the total of what you can deduct for the loss or outgoing for the *current year, or have deducted or can deduct for an earlier income year.

    * Effect on section 2040

    * (3) In applying the method statement in subsection 2040(2), reduce the **_total deductions for the loss or outgoing_** by the balancing charge.

          * Example: Continuing the example in subsection 2040(2): at the start of the 200506 income year, the company:

            * receives a further $10,000 as recoupment; and

            * sells the depreciating asset for $75,000.

          * As a result of the sale, a balancing adjustment of $5,000 is included under section 40285 in the company's assessable income for that income year.

          * How much of the recoupment amount received in the 200506 income year is assessable for that income year?

          * Applying the method statement in subsection 2040(2):

          *  After step 1: the total assessable recoupment is $30,000 (received during 200203 and 200506).

          *  After step 2: the recoupment already assessed is $20,000 (for 200203 and 200304).

          *  After step 3: the unassessed recoupment is:
          * total assessable recoupment minus recoupment already assessed, 
          * i.e. $30,000 minus $20,000 = $10,000.


          *  After step 4: the total deductions for the loss or outgoing are $30,000 ($10,000 for each of 200203, 200404 and 200405), reduced by $5,000 (the amount included in assessable income for the balancing adjustment), i.e. $25,000.

          *  After step 5: the outstanding deductions are: 
          * total deductions for the loss or outgoing minus recoupment already assessed, i.e. $25,000 minus $20,000 = $5,000.


          *  After step 6: the unassessed recoupment (step 3) is greater than outstanding deductions (step 5), so the amount of the outstanding deductions is included in assessable income, i.e. $5,000.

##### 2050  If the expense is only partially deductible

    * (1) This section extends the operation of section 2035 or 2040 (as appropriate) to a case where the total of what you can deduct under a provision (the **_deduction provision_**) for a loss or outgoing is limited to a proportion of the loss or outgoing.

    * (2) If you receive an *assessable recoupment of the loss or outgoing, section 2035 or 2040 applies as if:

      * (a) you had incurred _only_ that proportion of the loss or outgoing, but could deduct the _whole_ of that proportion under the deduction provision; and

      * (b) you had received only that proportion of the recoupment.

          * Example: You incur expenditure of $500. A provision listed in section 2030 entitles you to deduct 10% of the expenditure ($50) over 5 years. This means you can deduct $10 in each of the 5 years.

          * You recoup $300 of the expenditure. This section treats you as receiving only 10% of the recoupment. Therefore, $30 is dealt with by section 2040.

##### 2055  Meaning of previous recoupment law

    * (1) **_Previous recoupment law_** means a provision of the _Income Tax Assessment Act 1936_ listed in this table.

    * (2) Former section 330350 of this Act is also a **_previous recoupment law_**.

##### What if you can deduct a loss or outgoing incurred by another entity?

##### 2060  If you are the only entity that can deduct an amount for the loss or outgoing

    * This Subdivision applies in a different way if: 

      * (a) an entity (other than you) incurs a loss or outgoing; and 

      * (b) you can deduct the whole of the loss or outgoing for an income year, or you can deduct amounts for the loss or outgoing over 2 or more income years; and

      * (c) no other entity can deduct an amount for the loss or outgoing; and

      * (d) the entity that incurred the loss or outgoing receives one or more amounts as *recoupment of the loss or outgoing.

    * This Subdivision (except this section and section 2065) applies as if you had incurred the loss or outgoing and had also received the *recoupment.

##### 2065  If 2 or more entities can deduct amounts for the loss or outgoing

    * (1) Special rules apply if:

      * (a) an entity (the **_first entity_**) incurs a loss or outgoing; and 

      * (b) 2 or more entities (the **_deducting entities_**, which may include the first entity) have deducted or can deduct amounts for the loss or outgoing (whether for the same income year or for different income years); and

      * (c) the first entity receives one or more amounts as *recoupment of the loss or outgoing.

    * (2) This Subdivision (except this section and section 2060) applies as if the first entity and the deducting entities together constituted a single entity (the **_notional entity_**) that had:

      * (a) incurred the loss or outgoing; and

      * (b) received the amount or amounts as *recoupment; and

      * (c) included in its assessable income any amount included in the assessable income of any of the deducting entities under a *previous recoupment law or this Subdivision (except this section).

    * (3) If because of subsection (2) the notional entity's assessable income for an income year (the **_assessment year_**) would include an amount under this Subdivision (the **_assessable amount_**), the amount reverses in the assessment year the deductions for the loss or outgoing, in accordance with the rules in subsection (5).

    * (4) The assessable income of each deducting entity for the assessment year includes the total amounts (if any) by which that entity's actual deductions for the loss or outgoing are reversed in that income year.

    * (5) Deductions for the loss or outgoing are reversed in the assessment year as follows:

      * (a) the amounts by which deductions are reversed total the assessable amount (unless all the deductions have been reversed); 

      * (b) a deduction for an income year is not reversed until all deductions for earlier income years have been reversed; 

      * (c) a deduction is not reversed in the assessment year to the extent that it has already been reversed in an earlier year; 

      * (d) if each of 2 or more entities can deduct an amount for the loss or outgoing for the same income year, those deductions are reversed in the assessment year by amounts proportionate to the amounts of the deductions.

##### Subdivision 20B--Disposal of a car for which lease payments have been deducted

##### Guide to Subdivision 20B

##### 20100  What this Subdivision is about

    * This Subdivision reverses the effect of deductions for lease payments for a car leased to you (or to your associate), but only if you make a profit by disposing of the car after acquiring it from the lessor. The _smallest_ of these amounts is included in your assessable income:

      * your profit on the disposal;

      * the total deductible lease payments for the period of the lease;

      * the total amounts you could have deducted for the car's decline in value if, instead of leasing it, you had owned it and used it solely for the purpose of producing assessable income.

##### 20105  Map of this Subdivision

##### The usual case

##### 20110  Disposal of a leased car for profit

    * (1) Your assessable income includes the *profit you make on disposing of a *car if:

      * (a) the car was designed mainly for carrying passengers; and

      * (b) the car was leased to you and has been leased to noone else; and

      * (c) you or another entity can deduct for the income year any of the lease payments paid or payable by you, or have deducted or can deduct any of them for an earlier income year, under this Act; and

      * (d) you acquired the car from the lessor.

          * Note 1: Even if subsection (1) does not apply, an amount may still be included in your assessable income:

            * under section 20125 (which deals with more complicated cases that may involve your associate); or

            * if you disposed of an interest in a car (rather than the car itself): see section 20160.

          * Note 2: In some cases you do not include an amount in your assessable income:

            *  if there has been an earlier disposal of the car for market value: see section 20135; or

            *  if you inherited the car: see section 20145; or

            * if the car was let on hire in the circumstances set out in section 20155.

    * (2) However, the amount included cannot exceed the smaller of these limits:

      * (a) the total lease payments for the lease that you or another entity have deducted or can deduct under this Act for an income year;

      * (b) the amount of *notional depreciation for the lease period.

          * Note 1: If, because of more than one lease of the car, there is more than one way to work out the amount to be included, you only include the largest amount: see section 20130.

          * Note 2: In some cases you reduce the amount to be included:

            * if there has been an earlier disposal of the car, or of an interest in it: see section 20140; or

            *  if another provision requires you to include an amount because of the disposal: see section 20150.

    * (3) You increase those limits if you have previously leased the *car from the same lessor, or from an *associate of that lessor.

    * You increase the first limit by the total lease payments for each previous lease of that kind that you or another entity have deducted or can deduct under this Act for an income year.

    * You increase the second limit by the amount of *notional depreciation for the period of each previous lease of that kind.

##### 20115  Working out the profit on the disposal

    * (1) The **_profit_** on the disposal is the amount by which the *consideration receivable for the disposal exceeds:

       * the amount it cost you to acquire the *car;

    * plus: 

       * any capital expenditure you incurred on the car after acquiring it.

    * (2) The **_consideration receivable _**is worked out using this table:

    * (3) However, if the disposal of the *car is a *taxable supply, the **_consideration receivable_** does not include an amount equal to the *GST payable on the supply.

##### 20120  Meaning of notional depreciation

    * This is how to work out the **_notional depreciation_** for a lease period:

Method statement

        * Step 1.	Compare:

          *  	the *car's *cost to the lessor for the purposes of Subdivision 40C (which is about working out the cost of *depreciating assets);

        * with: 

          *  	the car's *termination value for the purposes of section 40300 when the lessor disposed of it.

        * Step 2.	If the car's cost exceeds the car's termination value, multiply the excess by:

          *  	the number of days in the lease period; 

        * divided by: 

          *  	the number of days the lessor owned the car.

        * Step 3.	The result is the **_notional depreciation_** for the lease period.

        * Step 4.	If the car's cost does _not_ exceed the car's termination value, the **_notional depreciation _**for the lease period is zero.

          * Note 1: The notional depreciation for the lease period represents:

            * the amount you could have deducted for the car's decline in value if, instead of leasing it, you had owned it and used it solely for the purpose of producing assessable income for that period; 

          * adjusted by: 

            * the balancing adjustment you would have made if you had disposed of the car at the end of that period.

          * Note 2: The car's cost to the lessor is worked out differently if the lessor acquired it in the 199697 income year or an earlier income year: see section 20105 of the _Income Tax (Transitional Provisions) Act 1997_.

          * Note 3: The car's termination value is worked out differently if the lessor disposed of it in the 199697 income year or an earlier income year: see section 20110 of the _Income Tax (Transitional Provisions) Act 1997_.

##### The associate case

##### 20125  Disposal of a leased car for profit

    * (1) Your assessable income includes the *profit you make on disposing of a *car if:

      * (a) section 20110 does _not _include an amount in your assessable income because of the disposal; and

      * (b) the car was designed mainly for carrying passengers; and

      * (c) the car was leased to you or your *associate; and

      * (d) you, your associate or another entity can deduct for the income year any of the lease payments paid or payable by the lessee, or have deducted or can deduct any of them for an earlier income year, under this Act; and

      * (e) either:

        * (i) you, your associate, or entities including you or your associate, acquired the car from the lessor; or 

        * (ii) another entity acquired the car from the lessor under an *arrangement that enabled you or your associate to acquire the car.

          * Note 1: Even if subsection (1) does not apply, an amount may be included in your assessable income if you disposed of an interest in a car (rather than the car itself): see section 20160.

          * Note 2: In some cases you do _not _include an amount in your assessable income:

            *  if there has been an earlier disposal of the car for market value: see section 20135; or

            *  if you inherited the car: see section 20145; or

            * if the car was let on hire in the circumstances set out in section 20155.

    * (2) However, the amount included cannot exceed the smallest of these limits:

      * (a) the total lease payments for the lease that you, your *associate or another entity have deducted or can deduct under this Act for an income year;

      * (b) the amount of *notional depreciation for the lease period;

      * (c) if an entity other than you, or if entities including you, acquired the *car from the lessor--the amount by which the *consideration receivable for the disposal of the car by you exceeds the total of:

        * (i) the car's cost to that entity, or those entities; and

        * (ii) any capital expenditure that entity, or any of those entities, incurred on the car after that acquisition and before you acquired it.

          * Note 1: If, because of more than one lease of the car, there is more than one way to work out the amount to be included, you only include the largest amount: see section 20130.

          * Note 2: In some cases you reduce the amount to be included:

            * if there has been an earlier disposal of the car, or of an interest in it: see section 20140; or

            *  if another provision requires you to include an amount because of the disposal: see section 20150.

          * Example: Your associate leases a car for 5 years and then acquires it from the lessor for $4,000. Your associate sells it to you for $3,000. You sell it for $10,000.

          * Your profit is $10,000 (the consideration receivable) less $3,000 (the car's cost to you) = $7,000.

          * The first 2 limits on the amount to be included in your assessable income are $9,000 (total deductible lease payments for the lease) and $8,000 (notional depreciation for the lease period).

          * Since your associate acquired the car from the lessor, the third limit is $10,000 (the consideration receivable by you) less $4,000 (the car's cost to the associate) = $6,000.

          * The amount you include in your assessable income _cannot_ exceed the smallest of the limits. So, you do not include your profit of $7,000. Instead, you include $6,000 (the smallest of the limits).

    * (3) You increase the first 2 limits if you, or your associate, have previously leased the *car from the same lessor, or from an associate of that lessor.

    * You increase the first limit by the total lease payments for each previous lease of that kind that you, your *associate or another entity have deducted or can deduct under this Act for an income year.

    * You increase the second limit by the amount of *notional depreciation for the period of each previous lease of that kind.

##### Successive leases

##### 20130  Successive leases

    * If, because of 2 or more leases of the *car, there are different amounts that could be included in your assessable income because of the disposal, only the largest of those amounts is included.

##### Previous disposals of the car

##### 20135  No amount included if earlier disposal for market value

    * You do _not _include an amount in your assessable income because of the disposal if, after the lessor disposed of the *car and before you disposed of it, an entity other than you disposed of the car and:

      * (a) the *consideration receivable for that disposal was at least the *market value of the car at the time of that disposal; or

      * (b) because of that disposal, that market value was included, or an amount worked out using that market value was included, in the entity's assessable income under this Act.

##### 20140  Reducing the amount to be included if there has been an earlier disposal

    * Each limit on the amount to be included in your assessable income because of your disposal of the *car is reduced if, after the lease period began and before your disposal, the car, or an interest in it, was disposed of in one of these situations:

          * Examples: Your associate leases a car for 5 years and then acquires it. Your associate disposes of it to you and section 20110 includes $500 in your associate's assessable income.

          * You later dispose of the car.

          * In working out the amount to include in your assessable income for your disposal, you _can_ reduce each limit in subsection 20125(2) by $500 because the disposal by your associate occurred _after_ the lease period began.

          * Contrast this case: 

          * You lease a car for 5 years and then acquire it. You dispose of it to another entity and section 20110 includes $1,000 in your assessable income.

          * You lease the car from that entity for 2 years and then acquire it. You later dispose of it.

          * In working out the amount to include in your assessable income in respect of the second lease, you _cannot_ reduce each limit in subsection 20110(2) by $1,000 because the first disposal did _not_ occur after the start of that lease.

          * Note: If the earlier disposal occurred in the 199697 income year or an earlier income year, each limit may be able to be reduced by a further amount: see section 20115 of the _Income Tax (Transitional Provisions) Act 1997_.

##### Miscellaneous rules

##### 20145  No amount included if you inherited the car

    * You do _not _include an amount in your assessable income because of the disposal if you inherited the *car.

##### 20150  Reducing the amount to be included if another provision requires you to include an amount for the disposal

    * The amount to be included in your assessable income because of the disposal is reduced by any amount that another provision of this Act (except sections 40285 and 40370) requires you to include in your assessable income because of the disposal.

          * Note: sections 40285 and 40370 are about including an amount after making a balancing adjustment on the disposal of a car.

##### 20155  Exception for particular cars taken on hire

    * This Subdivision does not apply to these kinds of leases: 

      * (a) letting a *car on hire under a *hire purchase agreement; or

      * (b) letting a *car on hire under an agreement of a kind ordinarily entered into by people who take cars on hire intermittently on an hourly, daily, weekly or monthly basis.

##### 20157  Exception for small business entities

    * This Subdivision does not apply to you if, at any time in the income year in which you disposed of the *car, it was allocated to a pool of yours under Division 328.

##### Disposals of interests in a car: special rules apply

##### 20160  Disposal of an interest in a car

    * (1) This Subdivision applies to the disposal of an interest in a *car in almost the same way as it does to the disposal of the car itself. The differences are set out below.

    * (2) Your assessable income includes so much of your *profit on the disposal as is reasonable. The limits in subsections 20110(2) and 20125(2) do _not_ apply.

    * (3) The cost of the interest to you is taken to be a reasonable amount.

    * (4) Sections 20135 and 20140 do _not_ apply to the disposal.

          * Note 1: Section 20135 says that you do not include an amount if there has been an earlier disposal of the car for market value.

          * Note 2: Section 20140 allows you to reduce the amount to be included if there has been an earlier disposal of the car.

    * (5) Section 20145 applies to the disposal if you inherited either the interest or the *car itself.

          * Note: Section 20145 says that you do not include an amount if you inherited the car.

##### Operative provisions

##### 255  Taxrelated expenses

    * (1) You can deduct expenditure you incur to the extent that it is for:

      * (a) managing your *tax affairs; or

      * (b) complying with an obligation imposed on you by a *Commonwealth law, insofar as that obligation relates to the *tax affairs of an entity; or

      * (c) the *general interest charge or the *shortfall interest charge; or

      * (ca) a penalty under Subdivision 162D of the *GST Act; or

      * (d) obtaining a valuation in accordance with section 30212 or 3115.

          * Note 1: To find out whether a trustee of a deceased estate can deduct expenditure under this section, see subsection 69(7) of the _Income Tax Assessment Act 1936_.

          * Note 2: If you receive an amount as recoupment of the expenditure, the amount may be included in your assessable income: see Subdivision 20A.

    * No deduction for certain expenditure

    * (2) You cannot deduct under subsection (1):

      * (a) *tax; or

      * (b) an amount withheld or payable under Part 25 or Part 210 in Schedule 1 to the _Taxation Administration Act 1953_; or

      * (c) expenditure for *borrowing money (including payments of interest) to pay an amount covered by paragraph (a) or (b); or 

      * (d) expenditure for a matter relating to the commission (or possible commission) of an offence against an *Australian law or a *foreign law; or

      * (e) a fee or commission for advice about the operation of a *Commonwealth law relating to taxation, unless that advice is provided by a *recognised tax adviser.

    * No deduction for expenditure excluded from general deductions

    * (3) You cannot deduct expenditure under subsection (1) to the extent that a provision of this Act (except section 81) expressly prevents or limits your deducting it under section 81 (about general deductions). It does not matter whether the provision specifically refers to section 81.

    * No deduction for capital expenditure

    * (4) You cannot deduct capital expenditure under subsection (1). However, for this purpose, expenditure is not capital expenditure merely because the *tax affairs concerned relate to matters of a capital nature.

          * Example: Under this section, you can deduct expenditure you incur in applying for a private ruling on whether you can depreciate an item of property.

    * Use of property taken to be for income producing purpose

    * (5) Under some provisions of this Act it is important to decide whether you used property for the *purpose of producing assessable income. For provisions of that kind, your use of property is taken to be for that purpose insofar as you use the property for:

      * (a) managing your *tax affairs; or

      * (b) complying with an obligation imposed on you by a *Commonwealth law, insofar as that obligation relates to the *tax affairs of another entity.

          * Example: You buy a computer to prepare your tax returns. The expenditure you incur in buying the computer is capital expenditure and cannot be deducted under this section. 

          * However, to the extent that you use the computer in preparing your income tax return, you will be able to deduct the decline in value of your computer under Division 40. That is because, under this subsection, the computer is property that you are taken to use for the purpose of producing assessable income.

    * (6) If another provision of this Act expressly provides that a particular use of property is not taken to be for the *purpose of producing assessable income, that provision overrides subsection (5).

    * No double deduction for general interest charge on a running balance account

    * (7) If you deduct *general interest charge that applies to an RBA deficit debt, you can't also deduct the corresponding general interest charge on *tax debts that have been allocated to the RBA.

          * Note: RBAs (running balance accounts) are dealt with in Part IIB of the _Taxation Administration Act 1953_.

    * Expenditure by trustee of deceased estate

    * (8) If:

      * (a) after you die, the trustee of your deceased estate incurs expenditure; and

      * (b) had you incurred the expenditure before you died, you could have deducted it under subsection (1);

    * for the purposes of assessing the trustee for the income year in which you died, the expenditure is a deduction under that subsection.

##### 2510  Repairs

    * (1) You can deduct expenditure you incur for repairs to premises (or part of premises) or a *depreciating asset that you held or used _solely_ for the *purpose of producing assessable income.

    * Property held or used partly for that purpose

    * (2) If you held or used the property only _partly_ for that purpose, you can deduct so much of the expenditure as is reasonable in the circumstances.

    * No deduction for capital expenditure

    * (3) You cannot deduct capital expenditure under this section.

##### 2515  Amount paid for lease obligation to repair

    * You can deduct an amount that you pay for failing to comply with a lease obligation to make repairs to premises if you use or have used the premises for the *purpose of producing assessable income.

          * Note: The amount is assessable income of the entity to which you pay it: either as ordinary income under section 65 or because it is included by section 1525.

##### 2520  Lease document expenses

    * (1) You can deduct expenditure you incur for preparing, registering or stamping:

      * (a) a lease of property; or

      * (b) an assignment or surrender of a lease of property;

    * if you have used or will use the property _solely_ for the *purpose of producing assessable income.

    * Property used partly for that purpose

    * (2) If you have used, or will use, the leased property only _partly_ for that purpose, you can deduct the expenditure to the extent that you have used, or will use, the leased property for that purpose.

##### 2525  Borrowing expenses 

    * (1) You can deduct expenditure you incur for *borrowing money, to the extent that you use the money for the *purpose of producing assessable income. In most cases the deduction is spread over the *period of the loan. 

          * For the cases where the deduction is _not_ spread, see subsection (6).

          * Note: Your deductions under this section may be reduced if any of your commercial debts have been forgiven in the income year: see Subdivision 245E.

    * Income year when money used solely for the purpose of producing assessable income

    * (2) You can deduct for an income year the maximum amount worked out under subsection (4) if you use the *borrowed money during that income year _solely_ for the *purpose of producing assessable income.

          * Example: In 199798 you borrow $100,000 and incur expenditure of $1,500 for the borrowing. You use the money to buy a house. Throughout 199899 you rent the house to a tenant. You can deduct for the expenditure for 199899 the maximum amount worked out under subsection (4).

    * Income year when borrowed money used partly for that purpose

    * (3) If you use the money only _partly_ for that purpose during that income year, you can deduct the proportion of that maximum amount that is appropriate having regard to the extent that you used the *borrowed money for that purpose.

          * Note: You cannot deduct anything for that income year if you do not use the money for that purpose at all during that income year.

    * Maximum deduction for an income year

    * (4) You work out as follows the maximum amount that you can deduct for the expenditure for an income year:

Method statement

        * Step 1.	Work out the **_remaining expenditure_** as follows:

          *  	For the income year in which the *period of the loan begins, it is the amount of the expenditure.

          *  	For a later income year, it is the amount of the expenditure reduced by the the maximum amount that you can deduct for the expenditure for each earlier income year.

        * Step 2.	Work out the **_remaining loan period_** as follows:

          *  	For the income year in which the *period of the loan begins, it is the period of the loan (as determined at the end of the income year).

          *  	For a later income year, it is the period from the start of the income year until the end of the period of the loan (as determined at the end of the income year).

        * Step 3.	Divide the remaining expenditure by the number of days in the remaining loan period.

        * Step 4.	Multiply the result from Step 3 by the number of days in the remaining loan period that are in the income year.

          * Example: To continue the example in subsection (2): suppose the original period of the loan is 4 years starting on 1 September 1997. What is the maximum amount you can deduct for the expenditure for 199798?

          * Applying the method statement: 

          *  After Step 1: the remaining expenditure is $1,500 (the amount of the expenditure).

          *  After Step 2: the remaining loan period is 4 years from 1 September 1997 (1,461 days).

          *  After Step 3: the result is $1,500 divided by 1,461 = $1.03.

          *  After Step 4: the result is $1.03 multiplied by 302 days = $310.06.

          * Suppose you repay the loan early, on 31 December 1998. What is the maximum amount you can deduct for the expenditure for 199899? 

          * Applying the method statement: 

          *  After Step 1: the remaining expenditure is $1,500 (the amount of the expenditure) reduced by $310.06 (the maximum amount you can deduct for 199798) = $1,189.94.

          *  After Step 2: the remaining loan period is the period from 1 July 1998 to 31 December 1998 (183 days).

          *  After Step 3: the result is $1,189.94 divided by 183 days = $6.50.

          *  After Step 4: the result is $6.50 multiplied by 183 days = $1,189.94.

    * Meaning of **period of the loan**

    * **	(5)	The **_period of the loan _**is the shortest of these periods:

      * (a) the period of the loan as specified in the original loan contract;

      * (b) the period starting on the first day on which the money was borrowed and ending on the day the loan is repaid;

      * (c) 5 years starting on the first day on which the money was borrowed.

    * When deduction not spread

    * (6) If the total of the following is $100 or less:

      * (a) each amount of expenditure you incur in an income year for *borrowing money you use during that income year _solely_ for the *purpose of producing assessable income;

      * (b) for each amount of expenditure you incur in that income year for borrowing money you use during that income year only _partly_ for that purpose--the proportion of that amount that is appropriate having regard to the extent that you use the money during that income year for that purpose;

    * you can deduct for the income year: 

      * (c) each amount covered by paragraph (a); and

      * (d) each proportion covered by paragraph (b).

##### 2530  Expenses of discharging a mortgage 

    * Mortgage for borrowed money

    * (1) You can deduct expenditure you incur to discharge a mortgage that you gave as security for the repayment of money that you *borrowed if you used the money _solely_ for the *purpose of producing assessable income.

    * Mortgage for property bought

    * (2) You can deduct expenditure you incur to discharge a mortgage that you gave as security for the payment of the whole or part of the purchase price of property that you bought if you used the property _solely_ for the *purpose of producing assessable income.

    * Money or property used partly for that purpose

    * (3) If you used the money you *borrowed, or the property you bought, only _partly_ for the *purpose of producing assessable income, you can deduct the expenditure to the extent that you used the money or property for that purpose.

    * No deduction for payments of principal or interest

    * (4) You cannot deduct payments of principal or interest under this section.

##### 2535  Bad debts

    * (1) You can deduct a debt (or part of a debt) that you write off as bad in the income year if:

      * (a) it was included in your assessable income for the income year or for an earlier income year; or

      * (b) it is in respect of money that you lent in the ordinary course of your *business of lending money.

          * Note: If a bad debt is in respect of a payment that is required to be made under a qualifying security (within the meaning of Division 16E of Part III of the _Income Tax Assessment Act 1936_): see subsection 63(1A) of that Act.

    * Writing off a debt you have bought

    * (2) You can deduct a debt that you write off as bad in the income year if you bought the debt in the ordinary course of your *business of lending money. However, you cannot deduct more than the expenditure you incurred in buying the debt.

    * Writing off part of a debt you have bought

    * (3) You can deduct a part of a debt if:

      * (a) you write off that part as bad in the income year; and

      * (b) you bought the debt in the ordinary course of your *business of lending money.

    * (4) However, the maximum that you can deduct under subsection (3) for one or more income years is the amount (if any) by which:

      *  	the expenditure you incurred in buying the debt;

    * exceeds: 

      *  	so much of the debt as has not yet been written off as bad.

    * Limit on deductions for bad debts under leases of luxury cars

    * (4A) There is a limit to how much you can deduct under this section for debts you write off that relate to *luxury car lease payments that have become or will become liable to be made under a lease of a *car to which Division 242 (about luxury car leases) applies.

    * (4B) The most you can deduct for an income year is:

### the interest for the notional loan you are taken to have made to the lessee;

    * reduced by: 

      *  	each amount that you have deducted, or can deduct, for an earlier income year under this section (or section 63 of the _Income Tax Assessment Act 1936_) for debts relating to *luxury car lease payments that have become or will become liable to be made under the lease.

    * Special rules affecting deductions under this section

    * (5) The rules described in the table may affect your entitlement to deductions under this section, or may result in a deduction being reversed.

    * Provisions of the _Income Tax Assessment Act 1997 _are identified in normal text. The other provisions, **in bold**, are provisions of the _Income Tax Assessment Act 1936_.

          * Note: Subsections 230180(3), (5) and (6) and 230195(3), (5) and (6) provide that in certain circumstances a deduction for a loss in relation to a financial arrangement is to be treated, for the purposes of this Act, as a deduction of a bad debt. The rules referred to in this subsection apply to that deduction.

##### 2540  Loss from profitmaking undertaking or plan

    * (1) You can deduct a loss arising from the carrying on or carrying out of a profitmaking undertaking or plan if any profit from that plan would have been included in your assessable income by section 1515 (which is about profitmaking undertakings and plans).

    * When section does not apply

    * (2) You cannot deduct a loss under subsection (1) if the loss arises in respect of the sale of property acquired on or after 20 September 1985.

          * Note: If you sell property you acquired _before_ 20 September 1985 for profitmaking by sale, you may be able to deduct a loss on the sale: see section 52 of the _Income Tax Assessment Act 1936_.

    * Notice to Commissioner

    * (3) You can deduct a loss under subsection (1), insofar as it arises in respect of property, only if:

      * (a) you notified the Commissioner that you acquired the property for the purpose of profitmaking by sale or for the carrying on or carrying out of any profitmaking undertaking or plan (however described); or

      * (b) the Commissioner is satisfied that you acquired the property for either of those purposes.

    * When notice must have been given

    * (4) The notice must have been given at or before the time you lodged your *income tax return:

      * (a) for the income year in which you acquired the property; or

      * (b) if you were not required to lodge an income tax return for that income year--for the first income year after that income year for which you _were_ required to lodge one.

##### 2545  Loss by theft etc.

    * You can deduct a loss in respect of money if: 

      * (a) you discover the loss in the income year; and

      * (b) the loss was caused by theft, stealing, embezzlement, larceny, defalcation or misappropriation by your employee or *agent (other than an individual you employ solely for private purposes); and

      * (c) the money was included in your assessable income for the income year, or for an earlier income year.

          * Note: If you receive an amount as recoupment of the loss, the amount may be included in your assessable income: see Subdivision 20A.

##### 2547  Misappropriation where a balancing adjustment event occurs

    * (1) You can deduct an amount if:

      * (a) a *balancing adjustment event occurs for a *depreciating asset you *held; and

      * (b) your employee or *agent misappropriates (whether by theft, embezzlement, larceny or otherwise) all or part of the amount applicable to you under:

        * (i) item 8 of the table in subsection 40300(2); or

        * (ii) item 1, 3, 4 or 6 of the table in subsection 40305(1);

      * in relation to the balancing adjustment event.

          * Note 1: The amount applicable to you under subsection 40300(2) or 40305(1) may be the market value of an asset or of a noncash benefit.

          * Note 2: If you receive an amount as recoupment of the amount misappropriated, the amount may be included in your assessable income: see Subdivision 20A.

    * (2) The amount you can deduct is so much of the amount misappropriated as represents an amount applicable to you under item 8 of the table in subsection 40300(2) or item 1, 3, 4 or 6 of the table in subsection 40305(1) in relation to the *balancing adjustment event.

    * (3) You can deduct the amount for the income year in which the misappropriation happens.

    * (4) You must reduce the amount you can deduct under this section if your deductions for the asset have been reduced under section 4025 because of use for a purpose other than a *taxable purpose. The reduction is by the same proportion you reduce the balancing adjustment amount for the asset under section 40290.

    * (5) Section 170 of the _Income Tax Assessment Act 1936_ does not prevent the amendment of an assessment for the purposes of giving effect to this section for an income year if:

      * (a) you discover the misappropriation after you lodged your *income tax return for the income year; and

      * (b) the amendment is made at any time during the period of 4 years starting immediately after you discover the misappropriation.

##### 2550  Payments of pensions, gratuities or retiring allowances

    * (1) You can deduct a payment of a pension, gratuity or retiring allowance that you make to:

      * (a) an employee; or

      * (b) a former employee; or

      * (c) a dependant of an employee or a former employee.

    * (2) However, you can deduct it only to the extent that it is made in good faith in consideration of the past services of the employee, or former employee, in any *business that you carried on for the purpose of gaining or producing assessable income.

    * (3) You cannot deduct a payment under this section if you can deduct it under any other provision of this Act.

##### 2555  Payments to associations

    * (1) You can deduct a payment you make for membership of a trade, business or professional association.

          * Note: Alternatively, you can deduct the expense under section 81 (which is about general deductions) if you satisfy the requirements of that section.

    * Maximum amount--$42

    * (2) However, $42 is the maximum amount you can deduct under this section for the payments that you make in the income year to any one association.

    * If you deduct under section 81

    * (3) If you deduct a payment under section 81 (which is about general deductions) instead of this section:

      * (a) the payment does _not_ count towards the $42 limit; and

      * (b) the amount that you can deduct for the payment is _not_ limited to $42.

##### 2560  Parliament election expenses

    * (1) You can deduct expenditure you incur in contesting an election for membership of:

      * (a) the Parliament of the Commonwealth; or

      * (b) the Parliament of a State; or

      * (c) the Legislative Assembly for the Australian Capital Territory; or

      * (d) the Legislative Assembly of the Northern Territory of Australia.

          * Note 1: Entertainment expenses are excluded: see section 2570.

          * Note 2: If you receive an amount as recoupment of the expenditure, the amount may be included in your assessable income: see Subdivision 20A.

##### 2565  Local government election expenses

    * (1) You can deduct expenditure you incur in contesting an election for membership of a *local governing body, but you cannot deduct more than $1,000 per election. You deduct the expenditure for the income year in which you incur it.

    * (2) However, you can deduct more than the $1,000 limit if:

      * (a) you have received an amount as *recoupment of the expenditure; and

      * (b) some or all of that amount is included in your assessable income for an income year; and

      * (c) the total of your deductions for the election would be less than the $1,000 limit if you disregarded so much (the **_assessed recoupment_**) of the expenditure as equals the amount so included in your assessable income.

    * In that case: 

      * (d) the assessed recoupment is disregarded in applying the $1,000 limit; and

      * (e) the further amount that you can deduct because of paragraph (d) is deducted for the income year referred to in paragraph (b).

          * Example: Chris is elected to the Bunyip Shire Council. In the 200708 income year he incurs expenditure of $1,200 in contesting the election, of which he deducts $1,000 (the limit under subsection (1)).

          * In 200809, Chris receives $360 as an assessable recoupment of the expenditure. $300 of that is included in his assessable income by section 2035 (as extended by section 2050).

          * Because of the assessable recoupment, $300 of the expenditure is disregarded under paragraph (2)(d) in applying the $1,000 limit. As a result, Chris's deductions are treated as being only $700, which is less than the limit. This does not affect his original deduction for 20072008, but it means he can deduct the previously undeducted $200, for 200809 (see paragraph (2)(e)).

          * This triggers a further application of section 2035 (as extended by section 2050) to include the remaining $60 of the assessable recoupment in Chris's assessable income for 200809. His total deductions (net of recoupment included in assessable income) come to $840, which is the same as his original expenditure (net of recoupment).

          * Note: An amount you receive as recoupment of expenditure may be included in your assessable income as an assessable recoupment under Subdivision 20A, as ordinary income under section 65 or as statutory income under some other provision.

##### 2570  Deduction for election expenses does not extend to entertainment

    * (1) To the extent that you incur expenditure in respect of providing *entertainment, you cannot deduct it under section 2560 or 2565.

    * (2) However, subsection (1) does not stop you deducting expenditure to the extent that you incur it in respect of:

      * (a) providing *entertainment that is available to the public generally; or

      * (b) providing food or drink to yourself, unless it would be concluded that you have a purpose of enabling or facilitating *entertainment to be provided to someone else.

##### 2575  Rates and land taxes on premises used to produce mutual receipts

    * (1) An entity can deduct these amounts it pays for premises:

      * (a) rates which are annually assessed;

      * (b) land tax imposed under a *State law or *Territory law.

    * But only if it uses the premises: 

      * (c) for the purpose of producing mutual receipts; or

      * (d) in carrying on a *business for the purpose of producing mutual receipts; or

      * (e) for the purpose of producing amounts to which section 5935 applies (amounts that would be mutual receipts but for prohibition on distributions to members); or

      * (f) in carrying on a *business for the purpose of producing amounts to which section 5935 applies.

          * Note: If the entity receives an amount as recoupment of the rates or land tax, the amount may be included in its assessable income: see Subdivision 20A

    * When premises used only for deductible purposes

    * (2) The entity can deduct the _whole_ of the rates or land tax if it uses the premises _only_ in one or more of these ways:

      * (a) for the purpose of producing mutual receipts;

      * (b) in carrying on a *business for the purpose of producing mutual receipts;

      * (c) for the *purpose of producing assessable income.

    * When premises used partly for deductible purposes

    * (3) If the entity uses the premises _partly_ in one or more of the ways referred to in subsection (2) and partly in some other way, it can deduct the rates or land tax to the extent that it uses the premises in one or more of the ways referred to in that subsection.

    * No deduction under section 81

    * (4) The entity cannot deduct the rates or land tax under section 81 (which is about general deductions).

##### 2585  Certain returns in respect of debt interests

    * (1) This section deals with a *return that an entity pays or provides on a *debt interest.

    * (2) The *return is not prevented from being a *general deduction for an income year under section 81 merely because:

      * (a) the return is *contingent on the economic performance (whether past, current or future) of:

        * (i) the entity or a part of the entity's activities; or

    * If you can't deduct, then related entity doesn't include amount as income

    * (4) To the extent that subsection (1) stops you deducting an amount, the amount is neither assessable income, nor exempt income, of the *related entity.

##### 2640  Maintaining your family

##### 2647  Nonbusiness boating activities

    * Object

    * (1) The object of this section is to improve the integrity of the taxation system by preventing deductions from boating activities that are not carried on as a *business being offset against other assessable income.

    * Rule

    * (2) This Act applies to you as if so much of the amounts relating to using or *holding boats that you could otherwise deduct for an income year as exceeds your assessable income from using or holding boats for that year:

      * (a) were not deductible for that income year; and

      * (b) were an amount (a **_quarantined amount_**) relating to using or holding boats that you can deduct for the next income year.

          * Note: A quarantined amount may be reduced under subsection (5) (for boat capital gains), reduced under subsection (7) (where you deduct part of a quarantined amount under subsection (6) for boat business profits), reduced under subsection (8) (about exempt income) or affected by subsection (10) (about bankruptcy).

          * Example: Ian does not use his boat in a business. In Year 1, Ian would be able to claim $100,000 in deductions for the boat (but for this subsection), including interest, depreciation and running costs. He earns only $40,000 of income from the boat. He can only deduct $40,000. He carries the remaining $60,000 forward to Year 2 (the quarantined amount).

          * In Year 2, Ian has $95,000 of expenses and $30,000 of income for the boat. He can deduct $30,000. The quarantined amount is now $125,000: the quarantined amount from Year 1 plus the excess of expenses over income from Year 2.

          * In Year 3, Ian has $60,000 of expenses and $150,000 of income from the boat. The expenses from Year 3 plus the quarantined amount is $185,000. Therefore, Ian claims a deduction of $150,000 and carries forward $35,000 to Year 4.

    *  Exception: business use

    * (3) The rule in subsection (2) does not apply to amounts that are attributable to one or more of the following:

      * (a) *holding a boat as your *trading stock;

      * (b) using a boat (or holding it) mainly for letting it on hire in the ordinary course of a *business that you *carry on;

      * (c) using a boat (or holding it) mainly for transporting the public or goods for payment in the ordinary course of a business that you carry on;

      * (d) using a boat for a purpose that is essential to the efficient conduct of a business that you carry on.

          * Note: Even if this exception applies to you, you may still have to quarantine losses under Division 35 (deferral of losses from noncommercial business activities).

    *  Exception: fringe benefits

    * (4) The rule in subsection (2) does not apply to so much of an amount you incur in *providing a *fringe benefit.

    * Modification if you have boat capital gains

      * (a) the entity can deduct amounts for a *depreciating asset under Division 40 or 328; and

      * (b) the entity has a *decreasing adjustment in an income year that relates directly or indirectly to the asset.

    * (1A) However, this section does not apply to a *decreasing adjustment that arises under Division 129 or 132 of the *GST Act.

          * Note: See instead section 2787.

    * (2) The asset's *cost is reduced by an amount equal to the *decreasing adjustment if the adjustment arises in the income year in which the asset's *start time occurs.

    * (3) The asset's *opening adjustable value for an income year and its *cost is reduced by an amount equal to the *decreasing adjustment if the adjustment arises in that year and that year is after the one in which the asset's*start time occurs.

    * (4) If the reduction under subsection (2) or (3) is more than:

      * (a) for a subsection (2) case--the *depreciating asset's *cost; or

      * (b) for a subsection (3) case--the depreciating asset's *opening adjustable value;

    * the excess is included in the entity's assessable income unless the entity is an *exempt entity.

    *  Exception: pooling

    * (5) This section does not apply to:

      * (a) a depreciating asset allocated to a lowvalue pool or a pool under Division 328 for or in the *current year; or

      * (b) *inhouse software if expenditure on the software is allocated to a software development pool for the current year; or

      * (c) a project pool.

##### 2787  Certain decreasing adjustments included in assessable income

    * (1) This section applies to an entity if:

      * (a) the entity can deduct amounts for a *depreciating asset under Division 40 or 328; and

    * (1) This section applies to an entity if:

      * (a) the entity can deduct amounts for a *depreciating asset under Division 40 or 328; and

      * (b) the entity has an *increasing adjustment in an income year that relates directly or indirectly to the asset.

    * (1A) However, this section does not apply to an *increasing adjustment that arises under Division 129 or 132 of the *GST Act.

          * Note: See instead section 2792.

    * (2) The asset's *cost is increased by an amount equal to the *increasing adjustment if the adjustment arises in the income year in which the asset's *start time occurs.

    * (3) The asset's *opening adjustable value for an income year and its *cost is increased by an amount equal to the *increasing adjustment if the adjustment arises in that year and that year is after the one in which the asset's *start time occurs.

    *  Exception: pooling

    * (4) This section does not apply to:

      * (a) a depreciating asset allocated to a lowvalue pool or a pool under Division 328 for or in the *current year; or

##### 2792  Certain increasing adjustments can be deducted

    * (1) This section applies to an entity if:

      * (a) the entity can deduct amounts for a *depreciating asset under Division 40 or 328; and

      * (b) the entity has an *increasing adjustment that arises under Division 129 or 132 of the *GST Act in an income year that relates directly or indirectly to the asset.

    * (2) The entity can deduct the amount of the *increasing adjustment for the income year.

    * (3) However, the entity cannot deduct the amount to the extent (if any) that the adjustment arises from an increase in the extent to which the activity giving rise to the adjustment is of a private or domestic nature.

##### 2795  Balancing adjustment events

    * (1) The *termination value of a *depreciating asset is reduced if the relevant *balancing adjustment event is a *taxable supply. The reduction is an amount equal to the *GST payable on the supply.

    * (2) However, subsection (1) does not apply if the *termination value of the *depreciating asset is modified under Division 40 to be its *market value.

    * (3) The *termination value of a *depreciating asset is increased if the entity that *held the asset has a *decreasing adjustment that relates directly or indirectly to that *taxable supply in the income year in which the *balancing adjustment event occurred. The increase is the amount of the decreasing adjustment.

    * (4) The *termination value of a *depreciating asset is decreased if the entity that *held the asset has an *increasing adjustment that relates directly or indirectly to that *taxable supply in the income year in which the *balancing adjustment event occurred. The decrease is the amount of the increasing adjustment.

    * (5) An amount is included in the assessable income of the entity that *held the asset if the entity has a *decreasing adjustment that relates directly or indirectly to that *taxable supply in a later income year. The amount included is the amount of the decreasing adjustment.

    * (6) The entity that *held the asset can deduct an amount if the entity has an *increasing adjustment that relates directly or indirectly to that *taxable supply in a later income year. The amount it can deduct is the amount of the increasing adjustment.

##### 27100  Pooling

    * (1) This section contains special rules for expenditure (the **_pooled expenditure_**) incurred by an entity:

      * (a) on a *depreciating asset allocated to a lowvalue pool; or

      * (b) on a depreciating asset allocated to a pool under Division 328 for or in an income year; or

      * (c) on *inhouse software if the expenditure on the software is allocated to a software development pool; and

      * (d) on *project amounts if the amounts are allocated to a project pool.

    * Reduced cost of assets allocated to a pool

    * (2B) A *depreciating asset's *cost is reduced if:

      * (a) an entity's acquisition or importation of the asset constitutes a *creditable acquisition or *creditable importation; and

      * (b) the entity is or becomes entitled to an *input tax credit for the acquisition or importation and the income year in which the acquisition or importation occurred is the same as the one in which the input tax credit arose; and

      * (c) the asset is allocated to a lowvalue pool or a pool under Division 328 for or in that year.

    * The reduction is the amount of the input tax credit.

    * Lowvalue pools

    * (3) For a lowvalue pool, the *closing pool balance of the pool for:

      * (a) if the credit year is later than the first income year for which *depreciating assets were allocated to the pool--the income year before the credit year; or

      * (b) if the credit year is the first income year for which *depreciating assets were allocated to the pool--the credit year;

    * is reduced by an amount equal to the input tax credit.

    * Software development pools and project pools

    * (4) For a software development pool or a project pool, the expenditure in the pool for the credit year, or the *pool value for the credit year, is reduced by an amount equal to the *input tax credit.

    * Small business pools

    * (5) For a pool under Division 328, the *opening pool balance of the pool for the credit year is reduced by an amount equal to the input tax credit.

    * No reduction if market value

    * (5A) However, there is no reduction to the *cost of a *depreciating asset if its cost is modified under Division 40 to be its *market value.

    * Second element of cost

    * (6) There is a reduction under subsection (7) if:

      * (a) the entity incurs expenditure in an income year (also the **_credit year_**) that is included in the second element of the *cost of a *depreciating asset allocated to a lowvalue pool or a pool under Division 328 for or in the credit year; and

      * (b) the entity is or becomes entitled, after the credit year, to an *input tax credit for the expenditure.

    * (7) An amount equal to the amount of the *input tax credit is applied in reduction of:

    * (7A) There is a reduction to an amount of expenditure included in the second element of the *cost of a *depreciating asset if:

      * (a) the asset is allocated to a lowvalue pool or a pool under Division 328 for or in the income year in which the expenditure was incurred; and

      * (b) the entity that incurred the expenditure is or becomes entitled to an *input tax credit for the expenditure; and

      * (c) the entitlement arises in the income year in which the expenditure was incurred.

    * The reduction is the amount of the input tax credit.

    * Increasing adjustments

    * (8) There is an increase under subsection (9) if the entity has an *increasing adjustment (except one that arises under Division 129 or 132 of the *GST Act) in an income year (the **_adjustment year_**) that relates directly or indirectly to a *creditable acquisition or *creditable importation to which the pooled expenditure relates.

          * Note: For an increasing adjustment that arises under Division 129 or 132 of the GST Act, see section 2792.

    * (9) An amount equal to the amount of that *increasing adjustment is added to:

      * (a) for a lowvalue pool:

        * (i) if the adjustment year is later than the first income year for which *depreciating assets were allocated to the pool--the *closing pool balance of the pool for the income year before the adjustment year; or

        * (ii) if the adjustment year is the first income year for which *depreciating assets were allocated to the pool--the *closing pool balance of the pool for the adjustment year; or

      * (b) for a pool under Division 328--the *opening pool balance of the pool for the adjustment year; or

      * (c) for *inhouse software--the amount of expenditure allocated to the software development pool for the adjustment year; or

      * (d) for a project pool--the *pool value for the adjustment year.

    * Decreasing adjustments

    * (10) There is a decrease under subsection (11) if the entity has a *decreasing adjustment (except one that arises under Division 129 or 132 of the *GST Act) in an income year (also the **_adjustment year_**) that relates directly or indirectly to a *creditable acquisition or *creditable importation to which the pooled expenditure relates.

          * Note: For a decreasing adjustment that arises under Division 129 or 132 of the GST Act, see section 2787.

    * (11) An amount equal to the amount of the *decreasing adjustment is applied in reduction of:

      * (a) for a lowvalue pool:

        * (i) if the adjustment year is later than the first income year for which *depreciating assets were allocated to the pool--the *closing pool balance of the pool for the income year before the adjustment year; or

        * (ii) if the adjustment year is the first income year for which *depreciating assets were allocated to the pool--the *closing pool balance of the pool for the adjustment year; or

    * (12) If the amount available for reduction under subsection (11) is more than the amount referred to in paragraph (11)(a), (b), (c) or (d) (whichever is applicable), the excess is included in the entity's assessable income unless the entity is an *exempt entity.

##### 27105  Other Division 40 expenditure

    * (1) This section applies to expenditure for which an entity can deduct amounts under Division 40 (but not under Subdivision 40B or 40E, or Subdivision 40I to the extent that that Subdivision relates to project pools).

    * (2) The amount of the expenditure is reduced if the entity is or becomes entitled to an *input tax credit for a *creditable acquisition or *creditable importation to which the expenditure directly or indirectly relates. The reduction is the amount of the input tax credit that relates to that expenditure.

    * (3) If the entity has a *decreasing adjustment in an income year that relates directly or indirectly to the expenditure, an amount equal to the decreasing adjustment is included in the entity's assessable income for that income year.

    * (4) If the entity has an *increasing adjustment in an income year that relates directly or indirectly to the expenditure, the entity can deduct an amount equal to the increasing adjustment for that income year.

    * (5) If the entity is a partnership and partners in that partnership can deduct amounts under Division 40 because section 40570 or 40665 applies, an amount equal to the *input tax credit, the *decreasing adjustment or the *increasing adjustment is apportioned to each of the partners as set out in subsection 40570(2) or 40665(2).

    * (6) However, this section does not apply to an *exempt entity.

##### 27110  Input tax credit etc. relating to 2 or more things

    * This Subdivision applies to an *input tax credit, or an *increasing adjustment or *decreasing adjustment, that relates directly or indirectly to 2 or more things of which at least one is a *depreciating asset as if a reasonable proportion of the input tax credit or adjustment related directly or indirectly to each of those depreciating assets and each of those other things.

    * (2) It also applies to a partnership that includes at least one individual, as if the partnership were an individual.

    * (3) It does not apply to any other entity.

##### 2812  Car expenses 

    * (1) If you owned or leased a *car, you can deduct for the car's expenses an amount or amounts worked out using one of 4 methods.

          * Note 1: For particular types of cars taken on hire you cannot use one of the 4 methods: see section 28165.

          * Note 2: In certain circumstances the lessee of a luxury car is taken to be its owner (see subsection 24215(2)).

          * Note 3: In certain circumstances (for example, under a hire purchase agreement) the notional buyer of property is taken to be its owner (see subsection 24020(2)).

    * (2) You must use one of the 4 methods unless an exception applies. If you can't use any of the methods, you can't deduct anything for the *car expenses.

##### 2813  Meaning of car expense

    * (1) A **_car expense _**is a loss or outgoing to do with a *car.

    * (2) In addition, any of the following is a car expense:

      * (a) a loss or outgoing to do with operating a *car;

      * (b) the decline in value of a car.

    * (3) None of the following is a car expense:

      * (a) a loss or outgoing incurred, or a payment made, in respect of travel outside Australia;

    * This Subdivision sets out the rules about choosing a method of calculating car expense deductions.

##### Table of sections

       * 2815	Choosing among the 4 methods

  * Operative provision

       * 2820	Rules governing choice of method

##### 2815  Choosing among the 4 methods

    * Below is a graphic that gives information about the 4 methods of calculating car expense deductions.

    * The 4 methods give you the choice of which method best suits your situation and needs.

    * For instance, some methods will involve more paperwork than others, but could give you bigger deductions. There are also eligibility requirements for some methods, so you need to check that you are eligible to use a particular method.

##### Operative provision

##### 2820  Rules governing choice of method

    * (1) You can choose only one method for all the *car expenses for the *car for the income year. Choosing one method precludes any other method.

    * (2) However, you can change your choice for the income year.

          * Example: You choose the "log book" method and deduct $1,000. On audit, the Commissioner finds that your claim is too high and should be reduced to $500. You would have been able to deduct $700 if you had chosen the "cents per kilometre" method. This rule lets you change your choice and deduct the $700.

    * (3) You can also choose different methods for the same *car for different income years and different methods for different cars for the same year.

##### Subdivision 28C--The "cents per kilometre" method

##### Table of sections

       * 2825	How to calculate your deduction

       * 2830	Capital allowances

       * 2835	Substantiation

##### 2825  How to calculate your deduction

    * (1) To calculate your deduction using the "cents per kilometre" method, you multiply:

       * the number of *business kilometres the *car travelled in the income year;

    * by: 

       * a number of cents based on the car's engine capacity.

    * The number of cents can be found in the regulations.

    * (2) But you can use this formula for the first 5,000 *business kilometres only. If the *car travelled more than 5,000 business kilometres, you must discard the kilometres in excess of 5,000.

          * Example: If the car travelled 5,085 business kilometres, you could claim for 5,000, and would lose the extra 85.

    * (3) **_Business kilometres _**are kilometres the *car travelled in the course of:

      * (a) producing your assessable income; or

      * (b) your *travel between workplaces.

    * You calculate the number of business kilometres by making a reasonable estimate.

##### 2830  Capital allowances

    * If a *balancing adjustment event occurs for the *car, you will need to refer to the capital allowances rules in Division 40 to find out how using this method affects the operation of those rules. See section 40370 (about balancing adjustments for some cars).

##### 2835  Substantiation

    * To use this method, you do _not_ need to substantiate the *car expenses for the *car.

##### Subdivision 28D--The "12% of original value" method

##### Table of sections

       * 2845	How to calculate your deduction

       * 2850	Eligibility

       * 2855	Capital allowances

       * 2860	Substantiation

##### 2845  How to calculate your deduction 

    * (1) Using the "12% of original value" method, you deduct 12% of the cost of the *car when you acquired it, or 12% of its *market value when you first began to lease it.

          * Note 1: The cost to a lessee of a luxury car to which Division 242 applies is to be worked out under section 24220.

          * Note 2: The cost of a car to which Division 240 applies is to be worked out under section 24025.

    * (2) But the most you can deduct using this method is 12% of the *car limit for the income year when you first used the *car for any purpose (if you own it) or when you first began to lease it.

          * Note: Section 40230 deals with the car limit.

    * (3) Your deduction is reduced if you did not own or lease the *car for the whole income year. You can only deduct the amount worked out using the formula:

    * The **_full year car deduction_** is the amount you could deduct if you had owned or leased the *car for the whole income year.

    * A **_carless day_** is a day when you did not own or lease the *car.

##### 2850  Eligibility

    * (1) You can use this method only if the number of *business kilometres travelled by the *car in the income year was more than 5,000, or would have been if you had used the car throughout the income year.

    * (2) **_Business kilometres _**are kilometres the *car travelled in the course of:

      * (a) producing your assessable income; or

      * (b) your *travel between workplaces.

    * You calculate the number of business kilometres by making a reasonable estimate.

##### 2855  Capital allowances

    * If a *balancing adjustment event occurs for the *car, you will need to refer to the capital allowances rules in Division 40 to find out how using this method affects the operation of those rules. See section 40370 (about balancing adjustments for some cars).

##### 2860  Substantiation

    * To use this method, you do _not_ need to substantiate the *car expenses for the *car.

##### Subdivision 28E--The "onethird of actual expenses" method

##### Table of sections

       * 2870	How to calculate your deduction

       * 2875	Eligibility

       * 2880	Substantiation

##### 2870  How to calculate your deduction

    * (1) Using the "onethird of actual expenses" method, you deduct onethird of each *car expense.

    * (2) The expense must qualify as a deduction under some provision of this Act outside this Division (or would qualify if, throughout the income year, you had used the *car only in producing your assessable income). If only part of the expense would qualify, you deduct onethird of that part.

          * Example: You borrow money to buy a car. You make repayments of principal and payments of interest.

          * You cannot deduct the repayments of principal because they are capital expenses.

          * The interest payments would be deductible in full if, throughout the income year, you had used the car only in producing your assessable income. Using the "one third of actual expenses" method, you can deduct onethird of the interest payments.

          * To find out whether an expense qualifies as a deduction under this Act, see Division 8 (Deductions).

##### 2875  Eligibility

    * (1) You can use this method only if the number of *business kilometres travelled by the *car in the income year was more than 5,000, or would have been if you had used the car throughout the income year.

    * (2) **_Business kilometres _**are kilometres the *car travelled in the course of:

      * (a) producing your assessable income; or

      * (b) your *travel between workplaces.

    * You calculate the number of business kilometres by making a reasonable estimate.

##### 2880  Substantiation

    * To use this method, you must substantiate the expenses under Subdivision 900C.

##### Subdivision 28F--The "log book" method

##### Table of sections

       * 2890	How to calculate your deduction

       * 2895	Eligibility

       * 28100	Substantiation

##### 2890  How to calculate your deduction

    * (1) To use the "log book" method, you multiply the amount of each *car expense by the *business use percentage.

    * The expense

    * (2) The expense must qualify as a deduction under some provision of this Act outside this Division (or would qualify if, while you *held the *car, you had used it only in producing your assessable income). If only part of the expense would qualify, you multiply that part by the *business use percentage.

          * Example: You borrow money to buy a car. You make repayments of principal and payments of interest.

          * You cannot deduct the repayments of principal because they are capital expenses.

          * The interest payments would be deductible in full if, throughout the income year, you had used the car only in producing your assessable income.

          * Using the "log book" method:

            * if you held the car for the whole income year--multiply the interest payments by the business use percentage;

            * if you held the car for only 6 months of the income year--multiply the interest payments for those 6 months by the business use percentage.

          * To find out whether an expense qualifies as a deduction under this Act, see Division 8 (Deductions).

    * The percentage

    * (3) The **_business use percentage_** is calculated by dividing:

       * the number of *business kilometres that the *car travelled in the period when you *held it during the income year;

    * by

       * the total number of kilometres that the car travelled in that period;

    * and expressing the result as a percentage.

    * (4) **_Business kilometres _**are kilometres the *car travelled in the course of:

      * (a) producing your assessable income; or

      * (b) your *travel between workplaces.

    * (5) You calculate the number of business kilometres by making a reasonable estimate. The estimate must take into account all relevant matters, including:

      * (a) any log books, odometer records or other records you have; and

      * (b) any variations in the pattern of use of the *car; and

      * (c) any changes in the number of cars you used in the course of producing your assessable income.

    * (6) You **_hold _**a *car while you own it, or it is leased to you, for use in the course of producing your assessable income, even if it is also used for some other purpose.

          * Note 1: In certain circumstances the lessee of a luxury car is taken to be its owner (see subsection 24215(2)).

          * Note 2: In certain circumstances the notional buyer of property is taken to be its owner (see subsection 24020(2)).

##### 2895  Eligibility

    * You can use this method only if you *held the *car for some or all of the income year.

##### 28100  Substantiation

    * (1) To use this method, you must substantiate the *car expenses under Subdivision 900C.

    * (2) You must also keep a log book. Subdivision 28G explains:

       * how often you need to keep a log book;

       * how to keep a log book.

    * The log book is relevant to estimating the number of business kilometres the *car travelled in the period when you *held it during the income year.

    * (3) You must keep odometer records for the period when you *held the *car during the income year. Subdivision 28H tells you about odometer records, which document the total number of kilometres the car travelled in that period.

    * (4) You must record the following information, in writing, before you lodge your *income tax return:

      * (a) your estimate of the number of *business kilometres; and

      * (b) the *business use percentage.

    * However, the Commissioner may allow you to record the information later.

    * (5) You must retain the log book and the odometer records. Subdivision 28I has the rules about this.

##### Subdivision 28G--Keeping a log book

##### Guide to Subdivision 28G

##### 28105  What this Subdivision is about

    * This Subdivision tells you how to keep a log book. A log book is relevant to estimating the number of business kilometres the car travelled in the period when you held it during the income year.

##### Table of sections

       * 28110	Steps for keeping a log book

  * Operative provisions

       * 28115	Income years for which you need to keep a log book

       * 28120	Choosing the 12 week period for a log book

       * 28125	How to keep a log book

       * 28130	Replacing one car with another

##### 28110  Steps for keeping a log book

    * There are 3 steps you need to follow in keeping a log book: 

       * identify an income year for which to keep a log book;

       * choose a period of at least 12 weeks for the log book to cover;

       * record journeys made in the car during the log book period in the course of producing your assessable income.

##### Operative provisions

##### 28115  Income years for which you need to keep a log book

    * (1) You need to keep a log book for the first income year for which you use this method for the *car.

    * (2) Having kept a log book for one income year, you don't need to keep a new one for the next 4 or more income years unless subsection (3) or (4) requires it. If you haven't kept a new log book for 4 income years in a row, you must keep one for the next income year.

          * Example: If you keep a log book in 199798, you would need to keep the next one in 20022003, unless subsection (3) or (4) requires one sooner.

    * (3) You must keep a log book for an income year if the Commissioner sends you a notice before the year directing you to keep a log book for the *car for that year.

    * (4) You must keep a log book for an income year if, during that year, you get one or more additional *cars for which you want to use the "log book" method for that year.

    * (5) When you replace one *car with another, you might have a period when you *hold both the new car and the old car, or a period when you no longer *hold the old car but do not yet hold the new car. In both these cases, you are treated for the purposes of subsection (4) as if you held the one car continuously.

    * (6) You may choose to keep a log book for an income year even if you don't need to; for example, because you want to establish a higher *business use percentage.

##### 28120  Choosing the 12 week period for a log book

    * (1) The log book must cover a continuous period of at least 12 weeks throughout which you *held the *car. If you hold the car for less than 12 weeks, the period must be the entire period for which you held the car.

    * (2) The period may overlap the start or end of the income year, so long as it includes part of the year.

    * (3) If you want to use the "log book" method for 2 or more *cars for the same income year, the log books for those cars must cover periods that are concurrent.

##### 28125  How to keep a log book

    * (1) It is in your interests to record in the log book any journey made in the *car during the log book period in the course of producing your assessable income. If a journey is not recorded, the log book will indicate a lower *business use percentage than is actually the case.

    * (2) A journey is recorded by making in the log book an entry specifying:

      * (a) the day the journey began and the day it ended;

      * (b) the *car's odometer readings at the start and end of the journey;

      * (c) how many kilometres the car travelled on the journey;

      * (d) why the journey was made.

    * The record must be made at the end of the journey or as soon as possible afterwards.

    * (3) If 2 or more journeys in a row are made in the *car on the same day in the course of producing your assessable income, they can be recorded as a single journey.

    * (4) The following must be entered in the log book:

      * (a) when the log book period begins and ends;

      * (b) the *car's odometer readings at the start and the end of the period;

      * (c) the total number of kilometres that the car travelled during the period;

      * (d) the number of kilometres that the car travelled, in the course of producing your assessable income, on journeys recorded in the log book;

      * (e) the number of kilometres referred to in paragraph (d), expressed as a percentage of the total number referred to in paragraph (c).

    * Each of the entries must be made at or as soon as possible after the start or end of the period, as appropriate.

    * (5) Each entry in the log book must be in English.

##### 28130  Replacing one car with another

    * (1) For the purposes of using the "log book" method, you may nominate one *car as having replaced another car with effect from a day specified in the nomination.

    * (2) After the nomination takes effect, the replacement *car is treated as the original car, and the original car is treated as a different car. This means that you do not need to repeat for the replacement car the steps you have already taken for the original car under this Subdivision.

    * (3) You must record the nomination in writing before you lodge your *income tax return for the income year in which the nomination takes effect. However, the Commissioner may allow you to do it later.

    * (4) You must retain the nomination document until the end of the period for which you must retain the last log book that you began to keep for the original *car before the day of effect of the nomination.

    * (5) Section 28150 (which is about retaining log books) applies to the nomination document in the same way as it applies to that last log book.

##### Subdivision 28H--Odometer records for a period

##### Guide to Subdivision 28H

##### 28135  What this Subdivision is about

    * This Subdivision tells you how to keep odometer records for a car during a particular period. Odometer records document the total number of kilometres the car travelled during a particular period.

##### Table of sections

  * Operative provision

       * 28140	How to keep odometer records for a car for a period

##### Operative provision

##### 28140  How to keep odometer records for a car for a period

    * (1) Odometer records for a period are kept in the form of a document in which the following are entered:

      * (a) the *car's odometer readings at the start and the end of the period;

      * (b) if there is a nomination under section 28130 to replace the car with another *car with effect from a day in that period--the odometer readings, at the end of that day, of both cars affected by the nomination.

    * (2) Each entry under subsection (1) must be in English and must be made at or as soon as possible after the start or end of the period, or the end of the specified day, as appropriate.

    * (3) The following must also be entered in the document:

      * (a) the *car's make, model and registration number (if any);

      * (b) if the car has an internal combustion engine--its engine capacity expressed in cubic centimetres;

      * (c) if there is a nomination under section 28130 to replace the car with another *car--the corresponding details for the other car affected by the nomination.

    * (4) Each entry under subsection (3) must be made in English and must be made before you lodge your *income tax return.

    * (5) The Commissioner may allow you to make an entry under this section after you lodge your *income tax return.

##### Subdivision 28I--Retaining the log book and odometer records

##### Table of sections

       * 28150	Retaining the log book for the retention period

       * 28155	Retaining odometer records

##### 28150  Retaining the log book for the retention period

    * (1) You must retain the log book:

      * (a) first, until the end of the latest income year for which you rely on the log book to support your calculation of the *business use percentage for the *car; and

      * (b) then for another 5 years.

    * The period for which you must retain the log book is called the **_retention period_**.

    * (2) The 5 years start on the due day for lodging your *income tax return for that latest income year. If you lodge your return later, the 5 years start on the day you lodge it.

    * (3) However, the *retention period is extended if, when the 5 years end, you are involved in a dispute with the Commissioner that relates to a deduction worked out using a *business use percentage that you are relying on the log book to support. See section 900170.

    * (4) If you do not retain the log book for the *retention period, you cannot deduct any amount worked out using a *business use percentage that you are relying on the log book to support. If you have already deducted such an amount, your assessment may be amended to disallow the deduction.

    * (5) For the purposes of the rules about retaining and producing records of expenses (see Subdivision 900G), the log book is treated as a record of the *car expenses for each year for which you use a *business use percentage that you are relying on the log book to support.

    * (6) If you lose the log book, there are rules that might help you in section 900205. For the purposes of the rules about relief from the effects of failing to substantiate (see Subdivision 900H), not doing something required by this Division is treated in the same way as not doing something necessary to follow the rules in Division 900.

##### 28155  Retaining odometer records

    * (1) You must retain your odometer records relating to the period when you *held the *car in the income year.

    * (2) If you keep a log book for the income year, you must retain the odometer records for the same period as the log book, and section 28150 applies to them in the same way as it applies to the log book.

    * (3) If you don't keep a log book for the income year, you must retain the odometer records for the same period as written evidence of a *car expense for the *car for the income year, and section 90075 applies to them in the same way as it applies to written evidence of an expense.

          * Note: Section 90075 is about retaining written evidence of a car expense.

##### Subdivision 28J--Situations where you cannot use, or don't need to use, one of the 4 methods

##### Guide to Subdivision 28J

##### 28160  What this Subdivision is about

    * This Subdivision sets out the situations where you cannot use, or don't need to use, any of the 4 methods. These situations involve either the nature of your car or the way you use it.

##### Table of sections

  * Operative provisions

       * 28165	Exception for particular cars taken on hire

       * 28170	Exception for particular cars used in particular ways

       * 28175	Further miscellaneous exceptions

       * 28180	Car expenses related to award transport payments

       * 28185	Application of Subdivision 28J to PAYE to recipients and payers of certain withholding payments

##### Operative provisions

##### 28165  Exception for particular cars taken on hire

    * (1) For particular types of *cars taken on hire you cannot use one of the 4 methods to calculate your deductions for *car expenses.

    * (2) Instead, you must calculate the deductions under the normal principles governing deductions, including the rules for apportioning a loss or outgoing that is only partly attributable to producing assessable income.

    * (3) This section applies to a taxi taken on hire.

    * (4) It also applies to a *motor vehicle taken on hire under an agreement of a kind ordinarily entered into by people who take motor vehicles on hire intermittently, as the occasion requires, on an hourly, daily, weekly or short term basis, except if the motor vehicle:

      * (a) has been taken on hire under successive agreements of a kind that result in substantial continuity of the motor vehicle being taken on hire; or

      * (b) it is reasonable to expect that the motor vehicle will be taken on hire under successive agreements of a kind that will so result.

##### 28170  Exception for particular cars used in particular ways

    * (1) For particular types of *cars used in particular ways you don't need to use one of the 4 methods to calculate your deductions for *car expenses.

    * (2) You _may _use one of the 4 methods, or you may instead calculate the deductions under the normal principles governing deductions, including the rules for apportioning a loss or outgoing that is only partly attributable to producing assessable income.

    * (3) This section applies if, whenever you used the *car in the income year:

      * (a) the car was covered by the description in column 2 of an item in the table below; and

      * (b) you used the car as described in column 3 of that item.

##### 28175  Further miscellaneous exceptions

    * (1) This section lists some miscellaneous cases where you don't need to use one of the 4 methods to calculate your deductions for *car expenses.

    * (2) You _may_ use one of the 4 methods, or you may instead calculate the deductions under the normal principles governing deductions, including the rules for apportioning a loss or outgoing that is only partly attributable to producing assessable income.

    * (3) The cases are as follows:

      * (a) the *car was unregistered throughout the period when you *held it during the income year, and during that period you used it principally in the course of producing your assessable income; or

      * (b) at some time during the income year the *car was part of the *trading stock of a *business of selling cars that you carried on, and you didn't use the car at any time during that year; or

      * (c) the expense is to do with repairs to or other work on the *car, and you incurred it in the course of a *business that you carried on of doing repairs or other work on cars.

    * In applying paragraph (a), the car is taken to be registered in a particular place while it is lawful to drive the car on a public road there.

##### 28180  Car expenses related to award transport payments

    * (1) Subdivision 900I (Award transport payments) allows certain losses or outgoings to be deducted without getting written evidence. The losses or outgoings are *transport expenses related to an allowance or reimbursement paid or payable to you by your employer under an *industrial instrument that was in force on 29 October 1986.

          * Note: This Subdivision also applies to entities that are _not_ employers, but pay (or are liable to pay) withholding payments covered by subsection 28185(3).

    * (2) If that Subdivision lets you deduct *car expenses, or parts of *car expenses, without getting written evidence, you don't need to use any of the 4 methods to calculate your deductions for those expenses or parts of expenses.

    * (3) However, your use of the 4 methods for _other _*car expenses you incur for the *car for the income year is affected, unless you elect not to rely on Subdivision 900I. Section 900250 deals with this matter.

##### 28185  Application of Subdivision 28J to recipients and payers of certain withholding payments

    * Application to recipients

    * (1) If an individual receives, or is entitled to receive, *withholding payments covered by subsection (3), this Subdivision applies to him or her:

      * (a) in the same way as it applies to an employee; and

      * (b) as if an entity (a **_notional employer_**) that makes (or is liable to make) such payments to him or her were his or her employer; and

      * (c) as if any other individual who receives, or is entitled to receive, such payments from a notional employer were also an employee of the notional employer.

    * Application to payers

    * (2) This Division applies to an entity that makes, or is liable to make, *withholding payments covered by subsection (3):

      * (a) in the same way as it applies to an employer; and

      * (b) as if an individual to whom the entity makes (or is liable to make) such payments were the entity's employee.

    * Withholding payments covered

    * (3) This subsection covers a *withholding payment covered by any of the provisions in Schedule 1 to the _Taxation Administration Act 1953 _listed in the table.

##### Table of sections

       * 305	How to find your way around this Division

       * 3010	Index

##### 305  How to find your way around this Division

    * (1) You should start at Subdivision 30A unless you are making a contribution or gift to a political party, independent candidate or member.

          * Note: Subdivision 30DA deals with the deductibility of contributions and gifts to political parties, independent candidates and members.

    * (2) Subdivision 30A contains a table of all the gifts and contributions that you can deduct. You need to look at the table to see whether the type of gift or contribution you are making is covered by it.

    * (3) In some cases, the table sends you off to Subdivision 30B. It has a number of tables that list particular funds, authorities or institutions that deductible gifts can be made to.

    * (4) In other cases, the table sends you off to Subdivision 30C. It contains rules that apply to particular gifts of property.

    * (4AA) Subdivision 30BA provides for the Commissioner to endorse as a deductible gift recipient an entity that is, or operates, a fund, authority or institution. The relevance of the Subdivision to you is that generally you can deduct only a gift you make to a recipient that is endorsed or named in:

      * (a) this Division; or

      * (b) regulations made for the purposes of this Division.

          * Note: The fact that gifts to a recipient registered in the Australian Business Register are deductible will be shown in the Register.

    * (4AB) Subdivision 30CA sets out administrative rules which do not directly affect whether you can deduct a gift you make. The rules require:

      * (a) a receipt issued by an entity for a gift to the entity or to a fund, authority or institution operated by the entity to show the entity's ABN; and

      * (b) the Australian Business Registrar to enter in the Australian Business Register a statement in relation to an entity entered in the Register if:

        * (i) gifts to the entity are deductible; or

        * (ii) gifts to a fund, authority or institution operated by the entity are deductible.

    * (4B) Subdivision 30DB allows you to spread deductions for certain gifts and covenants over up to 5 income years.

    * (5) Subdivision 30E requires the establishment of a register of *environmental organisations. Subdivision 30EA requires the establishment of a register of *harm prevention charities. Subdivision 30F requires the establishment of a register of *cultural organisations. Their only relevance to you is that you can deduct a gift that you make to a fund listed on one of those registers.

##### 3010  Index

    * There is an index to this Division in Subdivision 30G.

##### Subdivision 30A--Deductions for gifts or contributions

##### Table of sections

       * 3015	Table of gifts or contributions that you can deduct

       * 3017	Requirements for certain recipients

##### 3015  Table of gifts or contributions that you can deduct

    * (1) You can deduct a gift or contribution that you make in the situations set out in the following table. It tells you:

       * who the recipient of the gift or contribution can be; and

       * the type of gift or contribution that you can make; and

       * how much you can deduct for the gift or contribution; and

       * any special conditions that apply.

    * (2) A testamentary gift or contribution is not deductible under this section.

          * Note: Subdivision 30DA deals with the deductibility of contributions and gifts to political parties, independent candidates and members.

    * (3) For the purposes of items 4, 5 and 6 of the table in subsection (2), the *GST inclusive market values of the property or place in question are reduced by 1/11 if you would have been entitled to an *input tax credit if:

      * (a) you had *acquired the property or place at the time you made the gift; and

      * (b) your acquisition had been for a *creditable purpose.

    * (4) For the purposes of item 7 of the table in subsection (2), in working out the *GST inclusive market value of the right in question, disregard anything that would prevent or restrict conversion of the right to money.

    * (5) For the purposes of item 8 of the table in subsection (2), in working out the *GST inclusive market value of the goods or services in question, disregard anything that would prevent or restrict conversion of the goods or services to money.

##### 3017  Requirements for certain recipients

    * (1) This section sets out requirements to be met for you to be able to deduct a gift you make to a fund, authority or institution described in the column headed "Recipient" of item 1, 2 or 4 of the table in section 3015. However, this section does not apply to:

      * (a) a fund, authority or institution that is mentioned by name in an item of a table in Subdivision 30B; or

      * (c) the Australiana Fund.

    * (2) The fund, authority or institution must:

      * (a) be an entity or *government entity that is endorsed under Subdivision 30BA as a *deductible gift recipient; or

      * (b) in the case of a fund--either:

        * (i) be owned legally by an entity that is endorsed under Subdivision 30BA as a *deductible gift recipient for the operation of the fund; or

        * (ii) be under the control of one or more persons who constitute a *government entity that is endorsed under Subdivision 30BA as a *deductible gift recipient for the operation of the fund; or

      * (c) in the case of an authority or institution--be part of an entity or *government entity that is endorsed under Subdivision 30BA as a *deductible gift recipient for the operation of the authority or institution.

          * Example: A public fund that is established and maintained for constructing a building to be used by a State school and is controlled by the principal of the school would be an example of a fund under the control of one or more persons who constitute a government entity that is endorsed as a deductible gift recipient for the operation of the fund, if the school were so endorsed.

      * (a) the entity has an *ABN; and

      * (b) the entity:

        * (i) legally owns the fund; or

        * (ii) includes the authority or institution; and

    * Relevant special conditions in table in section 3015

    * (3) To avoid doubt:

      * (a) a condition requiring the fund, authority or institution to meet the requirements of section 3017 is not a relevant condition for the purposes of subparagraph (1)(b)(iii) or paragraph (2)(c) of this section; and

           * Note: Section 3017 requires the entity to be endorsed under this Subdivision as a deductible gift recipient.

      * (b) in the case of a fund, authority or institution that is described in item 1 of the table in section 3015--a condition set out in the relevant table item in Subdivision 30B, including a condition identified in the column headed "Special conditions--fund, authority or institution" of that item (if any), is a relevant condition for the purposes of subparagraph (1)(b)(iii) or paragraph (2)(c) of this section.

      * (a) any surplus assets of the gift fund (see section 30130); or

      * (b) if the entity is not required by this section to meet the requirements of section 30130--any surplus:

    * (7) The events are:

          * Note 1: There are 2 ways an entity can be endorsed because of a fund, authority or institution. An entity can be endorsed either _because it is_ a fund, authority or institution or _because it operates_ a fund, authority or institution.

          * Note 2: Section 42655 in Schedule 1 to the _Taxation Administration Act 1953_ deals with revocation of endorsement.

          * Note 3: The entity is also required to keep appropriate records: see section 38215 of the _Taxation Administration Act 1953._

    * Exception--only one gift fund required per entity

      * (a) the gift fund meets the requirements in paragraphs (1)(a), (b) and (c) in respect of each of the funds, authorities or institutions for which the gift fund is maintained; and

      * (b) the gift fund does not receive any other money or property.

    * (4) The entity must use a gift or contribution made to the fund and any money credited to the fund only for the principal purpose of the fund, authority or institution to which the gift, contribution or money relates.

##### _Government entities treated like entities

##### 30180  How this Subdivision applies to government entities

##### Valuation requirements

##### 30200  Getting written valuations

    * (1) You satisfy the valuation requirements if you get 2 or more written valuations of the gift you made.

          * Note 1: In most cases, you need to get these written valuations to be able to deduct a gift of property that you make to a recipient covered by item 4, 5 or 6 of the table in section 3015.

          * Note 2: You do _not _need to get written valuations in the circumstances set out in section 30205.

    * (2) The valuations must be by different individuals, each of whom is an approved valuer of the kind of property you are giving away.

          * Note: Section 30210 deals with how an individual becomes an approved valuer.

    * (3) Each valuation must state the amount that, in the opinion of the valuer, was:

      * (a) the *GST inclusive market value of the property on the day you made the gift; or

      * (b) the *GST inclusive market value of the property on the day the valuation was made.

    * (4) If a valuation states the *GST inclusive market value of the property on the day the valuation was made, it must have been made within 90 days before or after the gift was made. However, the Commissioner may allow a longer period than this.

##### 30205  Proceeds of the sale would have been assessable

    * (1) You do _not _need to get written valuations of the gift you made if:

      * (a) no amount is included in your assessable income in respect of the gift you made; but

      * (b) an amount _would_ have been included in your assessable income if you had sold the property instead of making the gift.

    * (2) However, this section does not apply if, apart from the operation of subsection 11860(2), an amount would have been included in your assessable income in respect of the gift you made.

##### 30210  Approved valuers

    * (1) The *Arts Secretary may approve an individual as a valuer of a particular kind of property. The approval must be in writing, signed by the Secretary.

      * (a) the individual's qualifications, experience and knowledge in valuing that kind of property; and

      * (b) the individual's knowledge of the current *GST inclusive market value of that kind of property; and

      * (c) the individual's standing in the professional community.

##### 30212  Valuations by the Commissioner

    * (1) If you make a gift or contribution that is covered by a provision of this Division that refers to the value of property as determined by the Commissioner, you must seek the valuation from the Commissioner.

    * (2) The Commissioner may charge you the amount worked out in accordance with the regulations for making the valuation.

##### Working out the amount you can deduct for a gift of property

##### 30215  How much you can deduct

    * (1) This section contains the rules for working out how much you can deduct for a gift of property that you make to a recipient covered by item 4, 5 or 6 of the table in section 3015.

    * (2) The general rule is that the amount you can deduct for a gift of this kind is the average of the *GST inclusive market values (as reduced under subsection 3015(3) if that subsection applies) specified in the written valuations you got from the approved valuers.

          * Note: In some situations you must reduce the amount you can deduct: see section 30220.

    * (3) The exceptions to the general rule are set out in this table:

    * (4) For the purposes of items 3 and 4 of the table in subsection (3), the *GST inclusive market values of the property in question are reduced by 1/11 if you would have been entitled to an *input tax credit if:

      * (a) you had *acquired the property at the time you made the gift; and

      * (b) your acquisition had been for a *creditable purpose.

##### 30220  Reducing the amount you can deduct

    * (1) The amount you can deduct is reduced by a reasonable amount if:

      * (a) the terms and conditions on which the gift is made are such that the recipient:

        * (i) does not receive immediate custody and control of the property; or

        * (ii) does not have the unconditional right to retain custody and control of the property in perpetuity; or

        * (iii) does not obtain an immediate, indefeasible and unencumbered legal and equitable title to the property; or

      * (b) the custody, control or use of the property by the recipient is affected by an *arrangement entered into in respect of the making of the gift.

    * (2) In deciding what is a reasonable amount, have regard to the effect of those terms and conditions, or that *arrangement, on the *GST inclusive market value of the gift.

##### Joint ownership of property

##### 30225  Gift of property by joint owners

    * If: 

      * (a) you own property jointly with one or more other entities; and

      * (b) you and the other entities make a gift of the property; and

      * (c) you would have been able to deduct the gift under section 3015 because of item 4, 5 or 6 of the table in that section if you had made a gift of the property as sole owner of it;

    * you can deduct so much of the gift as is reasonable, having regard to your interest in the property.

          * Note 2: There are other exceptions for a loss or outgoing you incur in providing a benefit that would be a fringe benefit if it were not an exempt benefit: see items 1.6 and 1.7 of the table in section 3230.

#### Division 35--Deferral of losses from noncommercial business activities

##### Guide to Division 35

##### 351  What this Division is about

    * This Division prevents losses of individuals from noncommercial business activities being offset against other assessable income in the year the loss is incurred. The loss is deferred.

    * It sets out an income requirement and a series of tests to determine whether a business activity is treated as being noncommercial.

    * The deferred losses may be offset in later years against profits from the activity. They may also be offset against other income if the income requirement and one of the other tests are satisfied, or if the Commissioner exercises a discretion.

##### Operative provisions

##### 355  Object

    * (1) The object of this Division is to improve the integrity of the taxation system by:

      * (a) preventing losses from noncommercial activities that are *carried on as *businesses by individuals (alone or in partnership) being offset against other assessable income; and

      * (b) preventing prebusiness capital expenditure and postbusiness capital expenditure by individuals (alone or in partnership) in relation to noncommercial activities being deductible under section 40880 (business related costs);

    * unless certain exceptions apply.

    * (2) This Division is not intended to apply to activities that do not constitute *carrying on a *business (for example, the receipt of income from passive investments).

##### 3510  Deferral of deductions from noncommercial business activities

    * (1) The rule in subsection (2) applies for an income year to each *business activity you carried on in that year if you are an individual, either alone or in partnership (whether or not some other entity is a member of the partnership), unless:

      * (a) you satisfy subsection (2E) for that year, and one of the tests set out in any of the following provisions is satisfied for the business activity for that year:

        * (i) section 3530 (assessable income test);

        * (ii) section 3535 (profits test);

        * (iii) section 3540 (real property test);

        * (iv) section 3545 (other assets test); or

      * (b) the Commissioner has exercised the discretion set out in section 3555 for the business activity for that year; or

      * (c) the exception in subsection (4) applies for that year.

          * Note: This section covers individuals carrying on a business activity as partners, but not individuals merely in receipt of income jointly. Compare the definition of _partnership_ in subsection 9951(1).

    * Rules

    * (2) If the amounts attributable to the *business activity for that income year that you could otherwise deduct under this Act for that year exceed your assessable income (if any) from the business activity for that year, or your share of it, this Act applies to you as if the excess:

      * (a) were not incurred in that income year; and

      * (b) were an amount attributable to the activity that you can deduct from assessable income from the activity for the next income year in which the activity is carried on.

          * Note 1: There are modifications of this rule if you have exempt income (see section 3515) or you become bankrupt (see section 3520).

          * Note 2: This rule does not apply if your excess is solely due to deductions under Division 41 (see section 3510 of the _Income Tax (Transitional Provisions) Act 1997_).

          * Example: Jennifer has a salaried job, and she also carries on a business activity consisting of selling lingerie.

          * Jennifer starts that activity on 1 July 2002, and for the 200203 income year, the activity produces assessable income of $8,000 and deductions of $10,000. The activity does not pass any of the tests and the discretion is not exercised so the $2,000 excess is carried over to the next income year in which the activity is carried on.

          * For the 200304 income year, the activity produces assessable income of $9,000 and deductions of $10,000 (excluding the $2,000 excess from 200203). Again, no tests passed and no exercise of discretion.

          * $3,000 is carried over to the next income year (comprising the $1,000 excess for the current year, plus the previous year's $2,000 excess) when the activity is carried on.

    * (2A) You cannot deduct an amount under section 40880 (business related costs) for expenditure in relation to a *business activity you used to *carry on if you are an individual, either alone or in partnership (whether or not some other entity is a member of the partnership) unless:

      * (a) you satisfied subsection (2E), and one of the tests set out in any of the following provisions was satisfied for the business activity:

        * (i) section 3530 (assessable income test);

        * (ii) section 3535 (profits test);

        * (iii) section 3540 (real property test);

        * (iv) section 3545 (other assets test); or

      * (b) the Commissioner has exercised the discretion set out in section 3555 for the business activity; or

      * (c) the exception in subsection (4) applied;

    * for the income year in which the business activity ceased to be carried on or an earlier income year.

    * (2B) If you are an individual, either alone or in partnership (whether or not some other entity is a member of the partnership), you cannot deduct an amount under section 40880 (business related costs) for expenditure in relation to a *business activity:

      * (a) you propose to *carry on; or

      * (b) another entity proposes to carry on if the other entity is not an individual, either alone or in partnership;

    * for an income year before the one in which the business activity starts to be carried on.

    * (2C) This section applies to an amount that you could have deducted, apart from paragraph (2B)(a), as if it were an amount attributable to the *business activity that you can deduct from assessable income from the activity for the income year in which the business activity starts to be *carried on.

    * (2D) You can deduct expenditure covered by paragraph (2B)(b) for the income year in which the *business activity starts to be *carried on.

    * Income requirement

    * (2E) You satisfy this subsection for an income year if the sum of the following is less than $250,000:

      * (a) your taxable income for that year;

      * (b) your *reportable fringe benefits total for that year;

      * (c) your *reportable superannuation contributions for that year;

      * (d) your *total net investment losses for that year.

    * For the purposes of paragraph (a), when working out your taxable income, disregard any excess mentioned in subsection (2) for any *business activity for that year that you could otherwise deduct under this Act for that year.

    * Grouping business activities

    * (3) In applying this Division, you may group together *business activities of a similar kind.

    * Exceptions

    * (4) The rule in subsection (2), (2A) or (2B) does not apply to a *business activity for an income year if:

      * (a) the activity is a *primary production business, or a *professional arts business; and

      * (b) your assessable income for that year (except any *net capital gain) from other sources that do not relate to that activity is less than $40,000.

    * (5) A **_professional arts business_** is a *business you carry on as:

      * (a) the author of a literary, dramatic, musical or artistic work; or

           * Note: The expression "author" is a technical term from copyright law.  In general, the "author" of a musical work is its composer and the "author" of an artistic work is the artist, sculptor or photographer who created it.

      * (b) a *performing artist; or

      * (c) a *production associate.

##### 3515  Modification if you have exempt income

    * (1) The rule in subsection 3510(2) may be modified for an income year if you *derived *exempt income in that year.

    * (2) Any amount to which paragraph 3510(2)(b) would otherwise apply for an income year for you is reduced by your *net exempt income for that year (after *utilising the net exempt income under section 3610 or 3615 (about tax losses)). This reduction is made before you apply the paragraph 3510(2)(b) amount against assessable income from the *business activity.

##### 3520  Modification if you become bankrupt

    * (1) The rule in subsection 3510(2) or (2A) is modified as set out in subsection (3) for an income year if in that year (the **_current year_**) you become bankrupt or are released from a debt by the operation of an Act relating to bankruptcy.

    * (2) The rule is also modified as set out in subsection (3) if:

      * (a) you became bankrupt before the current year; and

      * (b) the bankruptcy is annulled in the current year under section 74 of the _Bankruptcy Act 1966_ because your creditors have accepted a proposal for a composition or scheme of arrangement; and

      * (c) under the composition or scheme of arrangement, you have been, will be or may be released from some or all of the debts from which you would have been released if you had instead been discharged from the bankruptcy.

    * (3) This Act applies to you as if any amount that:

      * (a) paragraph 3510(2)(b) had applied to for an income year before the current year for you; and

      * (b) you have not yet deducted;

    * were not an amount attributable to the *business activity that you can deduct for the current year or a later income year.

##### 3525  Application of Division to certain partnerships

    * For the purpose of applying the tests in sections 3530, 3540 and 3545 where you carry on a *business activity in an income year as a partner, ignore:

      * (a) any part of the assessable income from the business activity for the year that is attributable to the interest of a partner that is not an individual in the partnership net income or partnership loss for the year; and

      * (b) any part of the assessable income from the business activity for the year that is *derived from the activity by another partner otherwise than as a member of the partnership; and

      * (c) any part of the *reduced cost bases or other values of assets of the partnership used in carrying on the activity in that year that is attributable to the interest of a partner that is not an individual in those assets; and

      * (d) any part of the reduced cost bases or other values of assets owned or leased by another partner that are not partnership assets and used in carrying on the activity in that year.

##### 3530  Assessable income test

    * The rules in section 3510 do not apply to a *business activity for an income year if:

      * (a) the amount of assessable income from the business activity for the year; or

      * (b) you started to carry on the business activity, or stopped carrying it on, during the year--a reasonable estimate of what would have been the amount of that assessable income if you had carried on that activity throughout the year;

    * is at least $20,000.

##### 3535  Profits test

    * (1) The rules in section 3510 do not apply to a *business activity (except an activity carried on by one or more individuals as partners, whether or not some other entity is a member of the partnership) for an income year (the **_current year_**) if, for each of at least 3 of the past 5 income years (including the current year) the sum of the deductions attributable to that activity for that year (apart from the operation of subsections 3510(2) and (2C)) is less than the assessable income from the activity for that year.

    * (2) For a *business activity you carried on with one or more others as partners, the rules in section 3510 do not apply to you for the current year if, for each of at least 3 of the past 5 income years (including the current year) the sum of your deductions (including your share of the partnership deductions) attributable to that activity for that year (apart from the operation of subsections 3510(2) and (2C)) is less than your assessable income (including your share of the partnership's assessable income) from the activity for that year.

##### 3540  Real property test

    * (1) The rules in section 3510 do not apply to a *business activity for an income year if the total *reduced cost bases of real property or interests in real property used on a continuing basis in carrying on the activity in that year is at least $500,000.

    * (2) You may use the *market value of the real property or interest if that value is more than its *reduced cost base.

    * (3) The *reduced cost base or *market value is worked out:

      * (a) as at the end of the income year; or

      * (b) if you stopped carrying on the *business activity during the year:

        * (i) as at the time you stopped; or

        * (ii) if you disposed of the asset before that time in the course of stopping carrying on the activity--as at the time you disposed of it.

    * (4) However, these assets are not counted for this test:

      * (a) a *dwelling, and any adjacent land used in association with the dwelling, that is used mainly for private purposes;

      * (b) fixtures owned by you as a tenant.

##### 3545  Other assets test

    * (1) The rules in section 3510 do not apply to a *business activity for an income year if the total values of assets that are counted for this test (see subsections (2) and (4)) and that are used on a continuing basis in carrying on the activity in that year is at least $100,000.

    * (2) The assets counted for this test, and their values for this test, are set out in this table:

    * (3) The value of such an asset is worked out:

      * (a) as at the end of the income year; or

      * (b) if you stopped carrying on the *business activity during the year:

        * (i) as at the time you stopped; or

        * (ii) if you disposed of the asset before that time in the course of stopping carrying on the activity--as at the time you disposed of it.

    * (4) However, these assets are not counted for this test:

      * (a) assets that are real property or interests in real property that are taken into account for that year under section 3540;

      * (b) *cars, motor cycles and similar vehicles.

##### 3550  Apportionment

    * If an asset that is being taken into account under section 3540 or 3545 is used during an income year partly in carrying on the relevant *business activity and partly for other purposes, only that part of its *reduced cost base, *market value or other value that is attributable to its use in carrying on the business activity in that year is taken into account for that section.

##### 3555  Commissioner's discretion

    * (1) The Commissioner may, on application, decide that the rule in subsection 3510(2) does not apply to a *business activity for one or more income years (the **_excluded years_**) if the Commissioner is satisfied that it would be unreasonable to apply that rule because:

      * (a) the business activity was or will be affected in the excluded years by special circumstances outside the control of the operators of the business activity, including drought, flood, bushfire or some other natural disaster; or

           * Note: This paragraph is intended to provide for a case where a business activity would have satisfied one of the tests if it were not for the special circumstances.

      * (b) for an applicant who carries on the business activity who satisfies subsection 3510(2E) (income requirement) for the most recent income year ending before the application is made--the business activity has started to be carried on and, for the excluded years:

        * (i) because of its nature, it has not satisfied, or will not satisfy, one of the tests set out in section 3530, 3535, 3540 or 3545; and

        * (ii) there is an objective expectation, based on evidence from independent sources (where available) that, within a period that is commercially viable for the industry concerned, the activity will either meet one of those tests or will produce assessable income for an income year greater than the deductions attributable to it for that year (apart from the operation of subsections 3510(2) and (2C)); or

      * (c) for an applicant who carries on the business activity who does not satisfy subsection 3510(2E) (income requirement) for the most recent income year ending before the application is made--the business activity has started to be carried on and, for the excluded years:

        * (i) because of its nature, it has not produced, or will not produce, assessable income greater than the deductions attributable to it; and

        * (ii) there is an objective expectation, based on evidence from independent sources (where available) that, within a period that is commercially viable for the industry concerned, the activity will produce assessable income for an income year greater than the deductions attributable to it for that year (apart from the operation of subsections 3510(2) and (2C)).

          * Note: Paragraphs (b) and (c) are intended to cover a business activity that has a lead time between the commencement of the activity and the production of any assessable income. For example, an activity involving the planting of hardwood trees for harvest, where many years would pass before the activity could reasonably be expected to produce income.

    * (2) The Commissioner may, on application, decide that the rule in subsection 3510(2B) does not apply to a *business activity for an income year if the Commissioner is satisfied that it would be unreasonable to apply that rule because special circumstances of the kind referred to in paragraph (1)(a) of this section prevented the activity from starting.

          * Note: This subsection is intended to provide for a case where a business activity would have begun to be carried on and satisfied one of the tests if it were not for the special circumstances.

    * (3) An application for a decision by the Commissioner under this section must be made in the *approved form.

       * 3620	Net exempt income

       * 3625	Special rules about tax losses

##### 3610  How to calculate a tax loss for an income year

    * (1) Add up the amounts you can deduct for an income year (except *tax losses for earlier income years).

    * (2) Subtract your total assessable income.

    * (3) If you *derived *exempt income, also subtract your *_net_ exempt income (worked out under section 3620).

    * (4) Any amount remaining is your **_tax loss_** for the income year, which is called a **_loss year_**.

          * Note 1: Some deductions are limited so that they cannot contribute to a tax loss. See section 2655 (Limit on certain deductions).

          * Note 2: The meanings of **_tax loss_** and **_loss year_** are modified by section 3655 for a corporate tax entity that has an amount of excess franking offsets.

    * (5) For subsection (3), if you have *exempt income under section 51100 (about shipping), disregard 90% of so much of your *net exempt income as directly relates to that exempt income.

##### 3615  How to deduct tax losses of entities other than corporate tax entities

    * (1) Your *tax loss for a *loss year is deducted in a later income year as follows if you are not a *corporate tax entity at any time during the later income year.

          * Note 1: See section 3617 for the deduction of a tax loss of an entity that is a corporate tax entity at any time during the later income year.

          * Note 2: A tax loss can be deducted only to the extent that it has not already been utilised: see subsection 96020(1).

    * If you have no net exempt income

    * **	**(2)	If your total assessable income for the later income year exceeds your total deductions (other than *tax losses), you deduct the tax loss from that excess.

    * If you have net exempt income

    * **	**(3)	If you have *net exempt income for the later income year and your total assessable income (if any) for the later income year exceeds your total deductions (except *tax losses), you deduct the tax loss:

      * (a) first, from your net exempt income; and

      * (b) secondly, from the part of your total assessable income that exceeds those deductions.

    * (4) However, if you have *net exempt income for the later income year and those deductions exceed your total assessable income, then:

      * (a) subtract that excess from your net exempt income; and

      * (b) deduct the tax loss from any net exempt income that remains.

          *  To work out your net exempt income: see section 3620.

    * General

    * (5) If you have 2 or more *tax losses, you deduct them in the order in which you incurred them.

##### 3617  How to deduct tax losses of corporate tax entities

    * (1) A *tax loss of an entity for a *loss year is deducted in a later income year as follows if the entity is a *corporate tax entity at any time during the later income year.

          * Note: A tax loss can be deducted under this section only to the extent that it has not already been utilised: see subsection 96020(1).

    * If the entity has no net exempt income

    * **	**(2)	If the entity's total assessable income for the later income year exceeds the entity's total deductions (except *tax losses), the entity is to deduct from that excess so much of the tax loss as the entity chooses. The entity may choose a nil amount.

    * If the entity has net exempt income

    * **	**(3)	If the entity has *net exempt income for the later income year and the entity's total assessable income (if any) for that year exceeds the entity's total deductions (except *tax losses), the entity is to:

      * (a) first, deduct the tax loss from the net exempt income; and

      * (b) secondly, deduct from the part of the total assessable income that exceeds those deductions so much of the undeducted amount of the tax loss (if any) as the entity chooses.

    * The entity may choose a nil amount under paragraph (b).

          * Note: To work out the corporate tax entity's net exempt income: see section 3620.

    * (4) However, if the entity has *net exempt income for the later income year and those deductions exceed the entity's total assessable income, the entity is to:

      * (a) subtract that excess from the net exempt income; and

      * (b) deduct the *tax loss from any net exempt income that remains.

          * Note: This means there is no choice available under this subsection.

    * (4A) For subsection (3) or (4), if the entity has *exempt income under section 51100 (about shipping) for the later income year, disregard 90% of so much of the entity's *net exempt income for the later income year as directly relates to that exempt income.

    * Limit to how much the entity can choose

    * (5) The choice that the entity has under subsection (2) or (3) for the later income year is subject to both of the following:

      * (a) the entity must choose a nil amount if, disregarding the *tax loss and other tax losses of the entity, the entity would have an amount of *excess franking offsets for that year;

      * (b) if, disregarding the tax loss and other tax losses of the entity, the entity would _not_ have an amount of excess franking offsets for that year--the entity must not choose an amount that would result in the entity having an amount of excess franking offsets for that year.

          * Example: For the 201516 income year, Company A (which is not a small business entity) has:

            * a tax loss of $150 from a previous income year; and

            * assessable income of $200 (franked distribution of $70, franking credit of $30 and $100 of income from other sources); and

            * no deductions; and

            * no net exempt income.

          * The tax offset of $30 from the franking credit is not stated in Division 67 to be subject to the refundable tax offset rules.

          * Company A would not have an amount of excess franking offsets for that year if the tax loss were disregarded (see section 3655). This is because the tax offset of $30 is less than $60, the amount of income tax that Company A would have to pay if it did not have the tax offset and the tax loss. Paragraph (a) therefore does not apply.

          * If Company A chooses to deduct the full amount of the tax loss, it would have an amount of excess franking offsets of $15:

          * Company A therefore cannot make this choice because of paragraph (b).

          * However, if Company A chooses to deduct $100 of the tax loss, it would not have an amount of excess franking offsets:

          * Company A therefore can choose to deduct $100 of the tax loss.

    * (6) The entity must state its choice under subsection (2) or (3) in its *income tax return for the later income year.

    * General

    * (7) If the entity has 2 or more *tax losses, the entity is to deduct them in the order in which the entity incurred them.

    * Recalculation of amounts resulting in a choice or a change of a choice

    * (10) Subsection (11) or (12) applies if at least one of the following amounts is recalculated after an entity has lodged its *income tax return for an income year:

      * (a) the amount of a *tax loss that the entity can *utilise in that year;

      * (b) the amount of the difference between the entity's total assessable income for that year and the entity's total deductions (other than *tax losses) for that year;

      * (c) the amount of the entity's *net exempt income for that year;

    * whether or not the amount is recalculated in an amendment of the entity's assessment for that year, and whether or not the amount was a nil amount before the recalculation (or has become a nil amount after the recalculation).

    * (11) If:

      * (a) before the recalculation, a choice under subsection (2) or (3) for the income year was not available to the entity; but

      * (b) as a result of the recalculation, the choice has (apart from subsection (6)) become available to the entity;

    * the entity can make that choice by written notice given to the Commissioner.

    * (12) If:

      * (a) the entity made a choice under subsection (2) or (3) for the income year; but

      * (b) as a result of the recalculation, the entity wishes to change that choice;

    * the entity can do so by written notice given to the Commissioner.

       * 3640	Deduction for amounts paid for debts incurred before bankruptcy

       * 3645	Limit on deductions for amounts paid

##### Operative provisions

##### 3635  No deduction for tax loss incurred before bankruptcy

    * (1) If:

      * (a) you became bankrupt; or

      * (b) you were released from a debt by the operation of an Act relating to bankruptcy;

    * before the income year, you cannot deduct a *tax loss that you incurred before the day on which you either became bankrupt or were released.

    * (2) If:

      * (a) you became bankrupt before the income year; and

      * (b) the bankruptcy is later annulled under section 74 of the _Bankruptcy Act 1966_ because your creditors have accepted your proposal for a composition or scheme of arrangement; and

      * (c) under the composition or scheme of arrangement, you have been, will be or may be released from some or all of the debts from which you would have been released if you had instead been discharged from the bankruptcy;

    * you cannot deduct a *tax loss that you incurred before the day on which you became bankrupt.

##### 3640  Deduction for amounts paid for debts incurred before bankruptcy

    * Tax losses generally

    * (1) If:

      * (a) you pay an amount in the income year for a debt that you incurred in an earlier income year; and

      * (b) you have a *tax loss covered by section 3635 for that earlier income year;

    * you can deduct the amount paid, but only to the extent that it does not exceed so much of the debt as the Commissioner is satisfied was taken into account in calculating the amount of the tax loss.

    * Film losses

    * (2) If:

      * (a) you pay an amount in the income year for a debt that you incurred in an earlier income year; and

      * (b) you incurred the debt in the course of deriving or gaining *assessable film income or *exempt film income; and

      * (c) you also incurred a *film loss covered by section 3635 in that earlier income year;

    * you can deduct the amount paid, but only to the extent that it does not exceed so much of the debt as the Commissioner is satisfied was taken into account in calculating the amount of the film loss.

    * (3) A **_film loss_** is the *film component (if any) of a *tax loss.

    * (4) Your *tax loss for an income year has a **_film component_** if your *film deductions for the year exceed the sum of:

      * (a) your *assessable film income for the year; and

      * (b) your *net exempt film income for the year.

    * The amount of the **_film component_** is the excess or the tax loss, whichever is lesser.

    * (5) However, if your *tax loss worked out under a provision listed in the table, the **_film component_** is what that tax loss would have been if:

      * (a) your *film deductions for the *loss year had been your only deductions; and

      * (b) your *assessable film income for the loss year had been your only assessable income; and

      * (c) your *net exempt film income for the loss year had been your only *net exempt income.

    * However, the **_film component_** cannot exceed the actual tax loss.

##### 3645  Limit on deductions for amounts paid

    * Tax losses generally

    * (1) The total of your deductions under subsection 3640(1) for amounts paid in the income year for debts incurred in the *loss year cannot exceed the amount of the *tax loss reduced by the sum of:

      * (a) your deductions under that subsection for amounts paid in earlier income years for debts incurred in the loss year; and

      * (b) any amounts of the tax loss *utilised in earlier income years; and

      * (c) any amounts of the tax loss that, apart from section 3635, would have been deductible from your *net exempt income for the income year or earlier income years.

    * Film losses

    * (2) The total of your deductions under subsection 3640(2) for amounts paid in the income year for debts incurred in the *loss year cannot exceed the amount of the *film loss reduced by the sum of:

      * (a) your deductions under that subsection for amounts paid in earlier income years for debts incurred in the loss year; and

      * (b) any amounts of the film loss deducted in earlier income years; and

      * (c) any amounts of the film loss that, apart from section 3635, would have been deductible from your *net exempt film income for the income year or earlier income years.

##### Subdivision 36C--Excess franking offsets

##### Guide to Subdivision 36C

##### 3650  What this Subdivision is about

    * Amounts of tax offsets to which a corporate tax entity is entitled under Division 207 and Subdivision 210H may in some circumstances be converted into an amount of a tax loss for the entity.

##### Table of sections

  * Operative provision

       * 3655	Converting excess franking offsets into tax loss

##### Operative provision

##### 3655  Converting excess franking offsets into tax loss

    * Excess franking offsets

    * (1) An entity that is a *corporate tax entity at any time during an income year has an amount of **_excess franking offsets _**for that year if:

      * (a) the total amount of *tax offsets to which the entity is entitled for that year under Division 207 and Subdivision 210H (except those that are subject to the refundable tax offset rules because of section 6725);

    * exceeds: 

      * (b) the amount of income tax that the entity would have to pay on its taxable income for that year if:

        * (i) it did not have those tax offsets; and

        * (ii) it did not have any tax offsets that are subject to the tax offset carry forward rules or the refundable tax offset rules; and

        * (iii) it did not have any tax offset under section 20570;

      * but had all its other tax offsets.

    * The excess is the amount of**_ excess franking offsets_**.

          * Note: Division 65 sets out the tax offset carry forward rules. Division 67 sets out which tax offsets are subject to the refundable tax offset rules.

          * Example: For the 201516 income year, Company E (which is not a small business entity) has:

            * assessable income of $200 (franked distribution of $140 and franking credit of $60); and

            * $100 of deductions that are allowable.

          * The tax offset of $60 from the franking credit is not stated in Division 67 to be subject to the refundable tax offset rules.

          * Disregarding the tax offset of $60 from the franking credit, the amount of income tax that Company E would have to pay is $30:

          * This amount is $30 less than the tax offset of $60. Company E therefore has an amount of excess franking offsets of $30 for that year.

    * How to work out the amount of the tax loss

    * (2) For the purposes of this Act, if:

      * (a) an entity has an amount of *excess franking offsets for an income year; and

      * (b) the result of applying the following method statement is a positive amount;

    * then: 

      * (c) the entity is taken to have a *tax loss for that year equal to that positive amount (instead of an amount of tax loss worked out under section 3610, 16570, 17535 or 70130); and

      * (d) that year is taken to be a *loss year for the entity if the entity would not otherwise have a tax loss for that year.

Method statement

        * Step 1.	Work out the amount (if any) that would have been the entity's *tax loss for that year under section 3610, 16570, 17535 or 70130 if the entity's *net exempt income for that year (if any) were disregarded.

              * Note: See section 3620 for the calculation of net exempt income.

        * Step 2.	Divide the amount of *excess franking offsets by the *standard corporate tax rate.

        * Step 3.	Add the results of steps 1 and 2.

        * Step 4.	Reduce the result of step 3 by the entity's *net exempt income for that year (if any).

        * The result of this step is taken to be the entity's *tax loss for that year. However, if the result of this step is nil or a negative amount, the company does not have any tax loss for that year.

          * Example: Assume that company E did not derive any exempt income for the 20022003 income year and that it would not otherwise have any tax loss for that year under section 3610, 16570, 17535 or 70130.

          * Applying the method statement, the amount of excess franking offsets of $30 generates a tax loss of $100 for that year, which can be deducted in a later income year under section 3615 or 3617.
