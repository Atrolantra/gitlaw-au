    * Interaction with other provisions

    * (3) For the purpose of working out your income tax for the financial year:

      * (a) section 410 of the _Income Tax Assessment Act 1997_ has effect as if it made you liable to pay the extra tax mentioned in subsection (1) of this section; and

      * (b) subsection 410(3) of that Act has effect as if step 4 of the method statement in that subsection were omitted and the following were substituted:

        * Step 3B.	Add the extra income tax you must pay as mentioned in subsection 411(1) of the _Income Tax (Transitional Provisions) Act 1997_.

##### 4010  Plant

    * (1) This section applies to you if:

      * (a) you have deducted or can deduct amounts for plant under Division 42 of the _Income Tax Assessment Act 1997_ (the **_former Act_**) as in force just before it was amended by the _New Business Tax System (Capital Allowances) Act 2001 _and the _New Business Tax System (Capital Allowances--Transitional and Consequential) Act 2001_, or you could have deducted amounts under that Division for the plant if you had used it, or had it installed ready for use, for the purpose of producing assessable income before that day; and

      * (b) either:

        * (i) you hold the plant at 1 July 2001; or

        * (ii) subparagraph (i) does not apply and you were the owner or quasiowner of the plant at the end of 30 June 2001.

    * (2) Division 40 of the _Income Tax Assessment Act 1997_ as amended by the _New Business Tax System (Capital Allowances) Act 2001 _and the _New Business Tax System (Capital Allowances--Transitional and Consequential) Act 2001_ (the **_new Act_**) applies to the plant on this basis:

      * (a) the amount that was your undeducted cost at the end of 30 June 2001 becomes the plant's opening adjustable value; and

      * (b) you use the same cost, effective life and method that you were using under Division 42 of the former Act, or that you would have used if you had used the plant for the purpose of producing assessable income at the end of 30 June 2001; and

      * (c) if you excluded an amount from your assessable income under section 42290 of the former Act for a balancing adjustment event that occurred on or before 11.45 am, by legal time in the Australian Capital Territory, on 21 September 1999--the cost of the plant, and its opening adjustable value, are reduced by that amount; and

      * (d) if subparagraph (1)(b)(ii) applies to you--you are treated as the holder of the plant while you are its holder or while the circumstances under which you would have been the owner or quasiowner of the plant under the former Act continue.

          * Note: There are special rules for entities that have substituted accounting periods: see section 4065.

    * (3) If you were using a rate for the plant under subsection 42160(1) or 42165(1) of the former Act just before 1 July 2001, or would have been using such a rate if you had used it, or had it installed ready for use, for the purpose of producing assessable income before that day, Division 40 of the new Act applies to the plant on this basis:

      * (a) for the diminishing value method--replace the component in the formula in subsection 4070(1) of the new Act that includes the plant's effective life with the rate you were using; and

      * (b) for the prime cost method:

        * (i) replace the component in the formula in subsection 4075(1) of the new Act that includes the plant's effective life with the rate you were using; and

        * (ii) increase the plant's cost under Division 42 of the former Act by any amounts included in the second element of the plant's cost after 30 June 2001.

          * Note 1: Recalculating effective life will have no practical effect for an entity to whom subsection (3) applies because the component in the relevant formula that relies on effective life has been replaced.

          * Note 2: Small business entities can choose to work out the decline in value of their depreciating assets under Division 328.

##### 4012  Plant acquired after 30 June 2001

    * (1) This section applies to you if:

      * (a) you entered into a contract to acquire an item of plant before 1 July 2001 and you acquired it after 30 June 2001; or

    * (2) Division 40 of the new Act applies to the plant.

    * (3) If you entered into the contract, or started to construct the plant, at or before 11.45 am, by legal time in the Australian Capital Territory, on 21 September 1999, you replace the component in the formula in subsection 4070(1) or 4075(1) of the new Act that includes the plant's effective life with the rate you would have been using if you had acquired it, or completed its construction, before 1 July 2001 and had used it, or had it installed ready for use, for the purpose of producing assessable income before that day.

##### 4013  Accelerated depreciation for split or merged plant

    * (1) This section applies to a depreciating asset that is plant if:

      * (a) you entered into a contract to acquire the plant, you otherwise acquired it or you started to construct it before 11.45 am, by legal time in the Australian Capital Territory, on 21 September 1999; and

      * (b) you held it at the end of 30 June 2001; and

      * (c) on or after 1 July 2001:

        * (i) the plant is split into 2 or more depreciating assets; or

        * (ii) the plant is merged into another depreciating asset.

    * (2) For a case where the plant is split into 2 or more depreciating assets, the new Act applies as if you had acquired the assets into which it is split before the time mentioned in paragraph (1)(a) while you continue to hold those assets.

    * (3) For a case where the plant is merged into another depreciating asset, section 40125 of the new Act does not apply to the asset, or to your interest in the asset, into which it is merged while you continue to hold it.

##### 4015  Recalculating effective life

    * You cannot recalculate the effective life of a depreciating asset for which:

##### 4020  IRUs

    * (1) This section applies to you if:

      * (a) you have deducted or can deduct an amount for an IRU under Division 44 of the former Act or you would have been able to deduct an amount for it under that Division if you had used it for the purpose of producing assessable income before 1 July 2001; and

      * (b) you hold the IRU at 1 July 2001.

    * (2) Division 40 of the new Act applies to the IRU on this basis:

      * (a) you use the cost, effective life and method you were using under Division 44 of the former Act or that you would have used if you had used the IRU for the purpose of producing assessable income before 1 July 2001; and

      * (b) the amount that was your undeducted cost of the IRU at the end of 30 June 2001 becomes the IRU's opening adjustable value.

          * Note: There are special rules for entities that have substituted accounting periods: see section 4065.

##### 4025  Software

    * (1) Despite its repeal by this Act, Division 46 of the former Act continues to apply to expenditure on software that you incurred and that was in a software pool under that Division at the end of 30 June 2001.

    * (2) For a unit of software for which you were deducting amounts under Subdivision 46B of the former Act or for which you could have deducted amounts under that Subdivision if you had used the software for the purpose of producing assessable income before 1 July 2001, Division 40 of the new Act applies to the unit on this basis:

      * (a) its cost is the amount of expenditure you incurred on the unit; and

      * (b) you must use the prime cost method; and

      * (c) its opening adjustable value at 1 July 2001 is its undeducted cost at the end of 30 June 2001; and

      * (d) you must use the same effective life you were using under Subdivision 46B of the former Act or that you would have used if you had used the software for the purpose of producing assessable income before 1 July 2001.

          * Note: There are special rules for entities that have substituted accounting periods: see section 4065.

    * (2) Division 40 of the new Act applies to the spectrum licence on this basis:

      * (a) its cost is your expenditure incurred in obtaining the licence; and

      * (b) its opening adjustable value at 1 July 2001 is the amount of unrecouped expenditure for the licence at the end of 30 June 2001; and

##### 4035  Mining unrecouped expenditure

    * (1) This section applies to you if you have an amount of unrecouped expenditure under Division 330 of the former Act at the end of 30 June 2001.

          * Note: Subsection (6) also applies to a case where you did not have unrecouped expenditure at 30 June 2001: see subsection (8).

    * (2) Division 40 of the new Act applies to the expenditure as if it were a depreciating asset (the **_notional asset_**) you hold on this basis:

      * (a) it has an opening adjustable value at 1 July 2001 equal to the amount of unrecouped expenditure reduced by any deductions allowable under section 33080 of the former Act for your income year ending on 30 June 2001; and

      * (a) for an amount of unrecouped expenditure in respect of expenditure incurred in carrying on eligible mining operations other than in the course of petroleum mining is the lesser of these:

        * (i) the number equal to the difference between 10 and the number of income years (which may be zero) before the present income year for which an amount in respect of expenditure was deductible;

        * (ii) the number equal to the number of whole years in the estimated life of the mine, or proposed mine, on the mining property, or, if there is more than one such mine, of the mine that has the longest estimated life, as at the end of the present income year; or

      * (b) for an amount of unrecouped expenditure in respect of expenditure incurred in carrying on eligible mining operations in the course of petroleum mining is the lesser of these:

        * (i) the number equal to the difference between 10 and the number of income years (which may be zero) before the present income year for which an amount in respect of expenditure was deductible;

    * (4) Sections 4095 and 40110 of the new Act do not apply to the unrecouped expenditure.

    * (5) If either:

      * (a) both of these subparagraphs apply:

        * (i) any of the unrecouped expenditure referred to in subsection (1) relates to a depreciating asset (the **_real asset_**);

        * (ii) in an income year (the **_cessation year_**) you stop holding the real asset, or stop using it for a taxable purpose; or

      * (b) both of these subparagraphs apply:

        * (i) any of the unrecouped expenditure referred to in subsection (1) relates to property that is not a depreciating asset (the **_other property_**);

        * (ii) in the cessation year, the other property is disposed of, lost or destroyed, or you stop using it for a taxable purpose;

    * there is an additional decline in value of the notional asset for the cessation year equal to so much of the notional asset's adjustable value as relates to the real asset or the other property and has not been taken into account in working out the amount of a balancing adjustment in relation to the real asset.

    * (6) If the other property is disposed of, lost or destroyed, or you stop using it for a taxable purpose, you must include in your assessable income:

      * (a) if the other property is sold for a price specific to that property--that price, less the expenses of the sale (to the extent the expenses are reasonably attributable to selling that particular property); or

      * (b) if the other property is sold with additional property without a specific price being allocated to it--the part of the total sale price, less the reasonably attributable expenses of the sale, that is reasonably attributable to selling the other property; or

      * (c) if the other property is lost or destroyed--the amount or value received or receivable under an insurance policy or otherwise for the loss or destruction; or

      * (d) if you own the other property and you stop using it for a taxable purpose--its market value at that time; or

      * (e) if you do not own the property and you stop using it for a taxable purpose--a reasonable amount.

    * However, the amount included is reduced to the extent (if any) that it is also included under subsection 40830(6) of the new Act.

    * (7) If section 40115 of the new Act applies, or section 40125 of the new Act would, apart from this subsection, apply, to the real asset referred to in subsection (5) of this section, then:

      * (a) if the real asset is split into 2 or more depreciating assets and you stop holding, or stop using for a taxable purpose, one or more but not all of the assets into which it is split--subsection (5) does not apply to that asset or assets into which it is split that you continue to hold and continue to use for a taxable purpose; or

      * (b) if the real asset is merged into another depreciating asset--section 40125 does not apply to the asset into which it is merged while you continue to hold it.

    * (8) Subsection (6) also applies to a case where:

      * (a) you did not have an amount of unrecouped expenditure under Division 330 of the former Act at the end of 30 June 2001, but you had an amount of unrecouped expenditure under that Division before 30 June 2001; and

      * (b) that expenditure relates to property that is not a depreciating asset (the **_other property_**); and

      * (c) after that day, the other property is disposed of, lost or destroyed, or you stop using it for a taxable purpose.

      * (c) the expenditure does not relate to a depreciating asset.

    * (2) Division 40 of the new Act applies to the expenditure as if it were a depreciating asset (the **_notional asset_**) you hold on this basis:

      * (a) it has a cost at the time you incur the expenditure equal to the amount of the expenditure; and

      * (b) in applying the formula in section 4075 of the new Act for the income year in which you incur the expenditure--you use the adjustments in subsection 4075(3) of the new Act; and

      * (c) it is taken to be used for a taxable purpose when you incur the expenditure; and

      * (d) it has an effective life worked out under subsection (3); and

      * (e) you must use the prime cost method.

          * Note: There are special rules for entities that have substituted accounting periods: see section 4065.

    * (3) The effective life of the notional asset at the start of an income year (**_present income year_**) for which you are working out its decline in value is:

      * (a) for an amount of expenditure incurred in carrying on eligible mining operations other than in the course of petroleum mining--the lesser of 10 and the number equal to the number of whole years in the estimated life of the mine, or proposed mine, on the mining property, or, if there is more than one such mine, of the mine that has the longest estimated life, as at the end of the present income year; or

      * (b) for an amount of expenditure incurred in carrying on eligible mining operations in the course of petroleum mining--the lesser of 10 and the number equal to the number of whole years in the estimated life of the petroleum field or proposed petroleum field as at the end of the present income year; or

      * (c) for an amount of expenditure incurred in carrying on eligible quarrying operations--the lesser of 20 and the number equal to the number of whole years in the estimated life of the quarry, or proposed quarry, on the quarrying property, or, if there is more than one such quarry, of the quarry that has the longest estimated life, as at the end of the present income year.

    * (4) Sections 4095 and 40110 of the new Act do not apply to the expenditure.

    * (5) If both of these paragraphs apply:

      * (a) any of the expenditure referred to in subsection (1) relates to property that is not a depreciating asset (the **_other property_**);

      * (b) in an income year (the **_cessation year_**), the other property is disposed of, lost or destroyed, or you stop using it for a taxable purpose;

    * there is an additional decline in value of the notional asset for the cessation year equal to so much of the notional asset's adjustable value as relates to the other property.

    * (7) The entity must work out the decline in value of each of the assets for later income years under Division 40 of the new Act.

    * (8) The entity must, in working out its deductions under this section for the calculation year for:

      * (a) allowable capital expenditure for which the entity had deducted or can deduct an amount under Subdivision 330C of the former Act; or

    * (10) You are entitled to a further deduction for a depreciating asset for which you are using the diminishing value method if the sum of the deductions worked out under paragraphs (2)(a) and (b) (the **_sum amount_**) is less than the deduction to which you would have been entitled for the asset if the former Act had continued to apply to the whole of the calculation year (the **_former Act amount_**).

    * (11) You increase the amount worked out under paragraph (2)(b) by the difference between the former Act amount and the sum amount.

       * 70115	Application of section 70115 of the _Income Tax Assessment Act 1997_ to insurance and indemnity payments in 199798 and later income years

##### 701  Application of Division 70 of the Income Tax Assessment Act 1997

    * (1) Division 70 (Trading stock) of the _Income Tax Assessment Act 1997_ applies to assessments for the 199798 income year and later income years.

    * (2) However, the sections of that Division listed in the table apply in accordance with the corresponding sections of this Act.

##### 7010  Accounting for your disposal of items that stop being trading stock because of the change of definition

    * (1) This section explains how to account for your disposal of an item during or after the 199798 income year if:

      * (a) just _before_ that income year, the item was an item of your trading stock, as defined in subsection 6(1) of the _Income Tax Assessment Act 1936_ as in force at that time; and

      * (b) at no time since that time has the item been an item of your trading stock, as defined in section 7010 of the _Income Tax Assessment Act 1997_.

          * Example: This section applies to an item you produced, manufactured, acquired or purchased _before_ 199798 for manufacture, sale or exchange, but have not held for that purpose at any time since just before the start of that year.

    * If the disposal is outside the ordinary course of business

    * (2) If:

      * (a) the disposal occurred _on or after_ 1 July 1997; and

      * (b) former subsection 36(1) of the _Income Tax Assessment Act 1936_ (dealing with disposals of trading stock outside the ordinary course of business) would have applied to the disposal if it had occurred _before_ 1 July 1997;

    * sections 7090 and 7095 of the _Income Tax Assessment Act 1997_ (dealing with disposals of trading stock outside the ordinary course of business) apply to your disposal of the item as if it were an item of your trading stock (as defined in section 7010 of the _Income Tax Assessment Act 1997_).

          * Note: This ensures that your assessable income includes the market value of the item on the day of disposal. This counters your deduction under the _Income Tax Assessment Act 1936_ for your expenditure to acquire the item as trading stock.

    * Additional rule for early balancers

    * (3) If the disposal occurred _before_ 1 July 1997, then, for the purposes of former subsection 36(1) of the _Income Tax Assessment Act 1936_ (dealing with disposals of trading stock outside the ordinary course of business), the item is taken to have been, at the time of the disposal, trading stock as defined in section 7010 of the _Income Tax Assessment Act 1997_.

          * Note: See the note to subsection (2).

    * Deduction for closing value at end of 199697

    * (4) If:

      * (a) former subsection 36(1) of the _Income Tax Assessment Act 1936_ applies to the disposal, or would have if it had occurred before 1 July 1997; and

      * (b) the item's value was taken into account at the end of the 199697 income year under former Subdivision B (Trading stock) of Division 2 of Part III of the _Income Tax Assessment Act 1936_;

    * you can deduct for the income year of the disposal the item's value as so taken into account.

          * Note: This deduction offsets the effect of the item's value _not_ having been taken into account under Subdivision 70C of the _Income Tax Assessment Act 1997_ at the start of the income year of the disposal.

##### 7020  Application of section 7020 of the Income Tax Assessment Act 1997 to trading stock bought on or after 1 July 1997

    * Section 7020 (Nonarm's length transactions) of the _Income Tax Assessment Act 1997_ applies to purchases that take place on or after 1 July 1997.

##### 7055  Cost of live stock acquired by natural increase

    * (1) Section 7055 of the _Income Tax Assessment Act 1997_ applies to animals acquired by natural increase in or after the 199798 income year.

    * (2) For the purposes of Subdivision 70C of the _Income Tax Assessment Act 1997_, the **_cost_** of an animal acquired by natural increase before the 199798 income year is the cost price of the animal under former section 34 of the _Income Tax Assessment Act 1936_.

    * (3) For the purposes of Subdivision 70C of the _Income Tax Assessment Act 1997_, the **_cost_** of an animal acquired by a partnership by natural increase before the 199798 income year depends on whether its cost price has been used in working out the share of a partner in the partnership's net income or partnership loss for an earlier income year:

      * (a) if it has, the **_cost_** is that cost price, or the _lowest_ of those cost prices if more than one cost price was used to work out the respective shares of partners;

      * (b) if it has not, the **_cost_** is the minimum cost price prescribed for the purposes of former section 34 of the _Income Tax Assessment Act 1936_ for that class of animal for the time when the animal was acquired, or the animal's actual cost price if no minimum was prescribed.

          * Note 1: Former section 93 of the _Income Tax Assessment Act 1936_ allowed each partner to choose the cost price of an animal for working out the partner's share of the partnership's net income or partnership loss for income years before the 199798 income year.

          * Note 2: Former section 34 of the _Income Tax Assessment Act 1936_ provides for the valuation of live stock acquired by natural increase before the 199798 income year.

##### 7070  Valuing interests in FIFs on hand at the start of 199192

    * (1) If:

      * (a) an interest in a FIF was an item of your trading stock on hand at the_ start _of the 199192 income year; and

      * (b) that interest was also an item of your trading stock on hand at the _end_ of the 199798 income year or a later income year;

    * the **_value_** of the item at the _end_ of the 199798 or later income year is the value of the item as taken into account under former Subdivision B (Trading stock) of Division 2 of Part III of the _Income Tax Assessment Act 1936_ at the _start_ of the 199192 income year.

    * (2) This section has effect despite section 7045 (the general rule about how to value your trading stock at the end of the income year) of the _Income Tax Assessment Act 1997_, but subject to subsection 7070(2) (which allows you to elect to value all your interests in FIFs at their market value instead) of that Act.

    * Effect of election under former subsection 31(5) of the Income Tax Assessment Act 1936 on valuation of interests in FIFs

    * (3) If you made an election under former subsection 31(5) of the _Income Tax Assessment Act 1936_ (to value all your interests in FIFs at market value), subsection 7070(2) of the _Income Tax Assessment Act 1997_ applies to your interests in FIFs as if you had made an election under subsection 7070(2).

##### 7090  Application of sections 7090 and 7095 of the Income Tax Assessment Act 1997 to disposals of trading stock outside the ordinary course of business

    * Sections 7090 (Assessable income on disposal of trading stock outside the ordinary course of business) and 7095 (Purchase price is taken to be market value) of the _Income Tax Assessment Act 1997_ apply to a disposal of an item of trading stock that takes place on or after 1 July 1997.

##### 70100  Application of section 70100 of the Income Tax Assessment Act 1997 to disposals of trading stock outside ordinary course of business

    * Basic application

    * (1) Section 70100 (Notional disposal when you stop holding an item as trading stock) of the _Income Tax Assessment Act 1997_ applies to trading stock that stops being trading stock on hand of an entity on or after 1 July 1997.

    * Transitional provision if that section affects an assessment for 199697

    * (2) The value of trading stock to which subsection (4) of that section applies is to be worked out using the rules in the _Income Tax Assessment Act 1936_ (and not the rules in Subdivision 70C of the _Income Tax Assessment Act 1997_) if:

      * (a) that section affects an assessment for the 199697 year of income under the _Income Tax Assessment Act 1936_; and

      * (b) an election is made under subsection (4) of that section to value trading stock at what would have been its value at the end of an income year ending on the day it became trading stock on hand of the second entity.

          * Note: Section 70100 of the _Income Tax Assessment Act 1997 _may affect an assessment for the 199697 income year if any of the entities with an interest in the trading stock (either before or after it becomes trading stock on hand of the second entity) has a 199697 income year ending on or after 1 July 1997.

##### 70105  Application of section 70105 of the Income Tax Assessment Act 1997 to deaths on or after 1 July 1997

    * (1) Section 70105 (Death of owner) of the _Income Tax Assessment Act 1997_ applies to trading stock that devolves as a result of a person dying on or after 1 July 1997.

    * Transitional provision if that section affects an assessment for 199697

    * (2) The value of an item to which subsection (3) or (4) of that section applies is to be worked out using the rules in the _Income Tax Assessment Act 1936_ (and not the rules in Subdivision 70C of the _Income Tax Assessment Act 1997_) if:

      * (a) that section affects an assessment for the 199697 year of income under the _Income Tax Assessment Act 1936_; and

      * (b) an election is made under subsection (3) or (4) of that section to value the item at an amount other than its market value.

          * Note: Section 70105 of the _Income Tax Assessment Act 1997 _may affect an assessment for the 199697 income year if an entity on which the item devolves has a 199697 income year ending on or after 1 July 1997.

##### 70115  Application of section 70115 of the Income Tax Assessment Act 1997 to insurance and indemnity payments in 199798 and later income years

    * Section 70115 (Compensation for lost trading stock) of the _Income Tax Assessment Act 1997_ applies to an amount received in the 199798 income year or a later income year by way of insurance or indemnity for a loss of trading stock, even if the loss occurred earlier. However, that section does not apply to an amount that is assessable income for an income year before the 199798 income year.

##### 8210  Pre10 May 2006 entitlements--transitional termination payments

    * (1) This Division applies in relation to a life benefit termination payment received by you on or after 1 July 2007 if:

      * (a) the payment is received by you because you are entitled to it under a written contract, a law of the Commonwealth, a State, a Territory or another country, an instrument under such a law, a collective agreement within the meaning of the _Fair Work (Transitional Provisions and Consequential Amendments) Act 2009_ or an AWA within the meaning of that Act; and

      * (b) the entitlement is provided for under that contract, law, instrument or agreement as in force just before 10 May 2006.

    * (2) However, this Division does not apply in relation to a life benefit termination payment received by you on or after 1 July 2012 (except to the extent provided by Subdivision 82E).

    * (3) This Division applies in relation to a life benefit termination payment only to the extent that the contract, law or agreement as in force just before 10 May 2006 specifies the amount of the payment, or a way to work out a specific amount of the payment.

    * (4) For the purpose of subsection (3), a specific amount can be worked out in ways including either or both of the following:

      * (a) by a method or formula for working out the amount;

      * (b) by provision for you or another person (or entity) to make a choice between forms of payment allowing amounts to be worked out as provided by subsection (3) and paragraph (a) of this subsection.

          * Example: For paragraph (b), a specific amount of a life benefit termination payment that you receive on 1 July 2007 can be worked out from the terms of your written contract if the contract provided (just before 10 May 2006) for you to choose between payment in the form of a cash amount of $100,000 or the transfer to you of 10,000 shares in a specified company.

          * Note: Section 8015 of the _Income Tax Assessment Act 1997 _allows for employment termination payments to include the transfer of property (for example, shares). If so, the market value of the property is included in the amount of the payment (except any part of the property for which separate consideration has been given).

    * (5) To the extent that this Division applies to a life benefit termination payment, Subdivision 82A of the _Income Tax Assessment Act 1997_ does not apply to the payment (subject to Subdivision 82E of this Act).

    * (6) In this Division:

    * **_transitional termination payment _**means:

      * (a) a life benefit termination payment to which this Division applies; or

      * (b) if this Division applies to only part of a life benefit termination payment--that part of the payment.

##### 8210A  Recipient has reached preservation age

    * Application

    * (1) This section applies to a transitional termination payment you receive (except any part of the payment that is a directed termination payment) if you are your preservation age or older on the last day of the income year in which you receive the payment.

          * Note 1: You do not pay income tax on directed termination payments: see section 8210G.

          * Note 2: Under section 8210C, you may also be entitled to a tax offset on the taxable component of a transitional termination payment you receive in an income year before the year in which you reached your preservation age.

    * Tax free component

    * (2) The tax free component of the payment is not assessable income and is not exempt income.

    * Taxable component

    * (3) The taxable component of the payment is assessable income.

    * (4) You are entitled to a tax offset that ensures that the rate of income tax on the amount mentioned in subsection (6) (the **_low rate part_**) does not exceed 15%.

    * (5) You are entitled to a tax offset that ensures that the rate of income tax on the amount mentioned in subsection (7) (the**_ middle rate part_**) does not exceed 30%.

          * Note: The remaining part is taxed at the top marginal rate in accordance with the _Income Tax Rates Act 1986_.

    * (6) The low rate part is so much of the taxable component of the payment as does not exceed your lower cap amount under section 8210B.

    * (7) The middle rate part is so much of the taxable component of the payment as:

      * (a) exceeds your low rate part (if any); and

      * (b) does not exceed the amount worked out as follows:

          * Note: If you have received another life benefit termination payment in the same income year (or in an earlier income year) that is not a transitional termination payment, your entitlement to a tax offset under this section is not affected by your entitlement (if any) to a tax concession for the other payment (under section 8210 of the _Income Tax Assessment Act 1997_).

##### 8210B  Lower cap amount

    * Initial lower cap amount is the ETP cap for the income year

    * (1) Your **_lower cap amount _**in relation to a transitional termination payment you receive at a time in an income year is the ETP cap amount for the year, reduced in accordance with this section.

          * Note: For the ETP cap amount, see section 82160 of the _Income Tax Assessment Act 1997_.

      * (a) by the amount (if any) (the **_cap excess_**) worked out under subsection (3); and

      * (b) by so much of the total amounts of transitional termination payments (if any) that you received at an earlier time (whether in the income year or in an earlier income year) for which you are entitled to a tax offset under subsection 8210A(4).

    * (3) For paragraph (2)(a), the cap excess is worked out using this method:

    * _Method statement_

        * _Step 1.	Work out the total of the taxable components of all the amounts (if any) of transitional termination payments received by you (including any directed termination payments received on your behalf) in any income year before the income year in which you reached your preservation age.

        * Step 2.	Work out the total of the taxable components of all the directed termination payments (if any) received on your behalf at an earlier time, in the income year in which you reached your preservation age or later.

        * Step 3.	Work out the amount (the **_cap difference_**) by which $1,000,000 exceeds the ETP cap for the income year in which you receive the payment to which subsection (1) applies.

        * Step 4.	The cap excess is the amount (not less than zero) by which the sum of the amounts in steps 1 and 2 exceeds the cap difference in step 3.

    * Directed termination payments--time of receipt when received by entity to which they are directed

    * (4) For the purposes of this section, a directed termination payment is taken to be received on your behalf at the time the entity to which it is directed receives the payment.

    * ETP cap not to be reduced under section 8210 of the Income Tax Assessment Act 1997

    * (5) The amount is so much of the taxable component of the payment as does not exceed your upper cap amount under section 8210D.

          * Note: If you have received another life benefit termination payment in the same income year (or in an earlier income year) that is not a transitional termination payment, your entitlement to a tax offset under this section is not affected by your entitlement (if any) to a tax concession for the other payment (under section 8210 of the _Income Tax Assessment Act 1997_).

##### 8210D  Upper cap amount

    * Initial upper cap amount is $1,000,000

    * General rule

    * (1) In working out whether you have made a capital gain or a capital loss from a CGT event that happens in relation to a CGT asset in the 199899 income year or a later income year, you use only the provisions of Parts 31 and 33 of the _Income Tax Assessment Act 1997 _(or a provision of an Act that modifies the operation of those Parts) unless a provision of this Part or Part 33 of this Act also requires you to use another provision.

          * Note 1: This means that, for example, in working out your cost base of the asset, you will apply the new law to circumstances that occurred before the 199899 income year (except where this Act requires you to use another provision).

          * Note 2: In most cases, the other provision is a provision of this Act. However, in some cases, other provisions may be relevant (for example, provisions of the _Income Tax Assessment Act 1936_).

##### _10215  Applying net capital losses

    * (2) If you had a net capital loss for the 199798 income year, or some unapplied net capital loss for either of the 2 preceding income years, under former Part IIIA of the _Income Tax Assessment Act 1936_, it can be carried forward to a later income year to be applied under the _Income Tax Assessment Act 1997_.

        * (ii) if the originating company and the recipient company are members of the same consolidated group or consolidatable group and the head company of that group has a substituted accounting period--before the end of the head company's income year in which 30 June 2004 occurs.

    * (2) The CGT asset involved (the **_rollover asset_**) must not be trading stock of the recipient company just after the time of the transfer.

    * (3) If:

      * (a) the rollover asset is a right or convertible interest referred to in Division 130, or an option referred to in Division 134, of the _Income Tax Assessment Act 1997_ or an exchangeable interest; and

      * (b) the recipient company acquires another CGT asset by exercising the right or option or by converting the convertible interest or in exchange for the disposal or redemption of the exchangeable interest;

    * the other asset cannot become trading stock of the recipient company just after the recipient company acquired it.

    * (1) A capital gain or capital loss the originating company makes from the CGT event is disregarded.

    * (2) The first element of the cost base of the original asset or the replacement asset for the recipient company is the cost base of the original asset for the originating company just before the time of the CGT event.

    * (3) The first element of the reduced cost base of the original asset or the replacement asset for the recipient company is worked out similarly.

    * (4) For a case where the originating company creates a CGT asset in the recipient company, the first element of the asset's cost base (in the hands of the recipient company) is the amount applicable under this table. The first element of its reduced cost base is worked out similarly.

    *  The expenditure can include giving property: see section 1035 of the _Income Tax Assessment Act 1997_.

    * (5) If the originating company acquired the original asset before 20 September 1985, the recipient company is taken to have acquired the original asset or the replacement asset before that day.

##### 1525  Small business rollover chosen but no capital gain returned

    * (1) This section applies if:

      * (a) you chose a rollover under Subdivision 152E of the _Income Tax Assessment Act 1997_ (or under former Division 123 of that Act) for a capital gain you made for an income year from a CGT event that happened in relation to a CGT asset before the commencement of this section; and

    * (3) If you acquired a replacement asset within the period (the **_replacement asset period_**) ending 2 years after the last CGT event in the income year for which you obtained the rollover but the total of the first and second elements of the cost base of that asset is less than the amount of the capital gain that would, apart from this subsection, be disregarded, the amount to be disregarded is that total.

    * (4) However, if you do not acquire a replacement asset within the replacement asset period, that Act applies to you as if you had never chosen the rollover, and the capital gain is not disregarded.

    * (2) The capital gain is disregarded for the purposes of the _Income Tax Assessment Act 1997_.

    * (3) If you acquired a replacement asset within the replacement asset period but the total of the first and second elements of the cost base of that asset is less than the amount of the capital gain that would, apart from this subsection, be disregarded, the amount to be disregarded is that total.

    * (4) However, if you do not acquire a replacement asset within the replacement asset period, that Act applies to you as if you had never chosen the rollover, and the capital gain is not disregarded.

    * (3) The further notice:

      * (a) must vary the notice referred to in subsection (2) in such a way (which may include setting out additional information) that the notice as varied complies with section 165115ZC of the _Income Tax Assessment Act 1997_ as affected by the amendments; and

      * (b) must be given within the 6 months referred to in subsection (1) of this section, or within a further period allowed by the Commissioner; and

      * (c) must otherwise be given in accordance with that section.

    * Special rules for consolidatable groups and potential MEC groups

##### 165115ZD  Adjustment (or further adjustment) for interest realised at a loss after global method has been used

    * (1) This section affects how sections 165115ZA and 165115ZB of the _Income Tax Assessment Act 1997_ apply to an interest (the **_equity_**) in, or a debt owed by, a company if apart from this section, a loss (the **_realised loss_**):

      * (a) would be realised for income tax purposes by a realisation event that happens to the equity or debt; or

      * (b) would be so realised but for Subdivision 170D of that Act (which defers realisation of capital losses and deductions);

    * and the company chose to use the global method of working out whether it had an adjusted unrealised loss at the last alteration time: 

      * (c) that happened for the company, before the realisation event; and

      * (d) immediately before which the equity or debt was, or was part of:

        * (i) if the company was a loss company at that alteration time--a relevant equity interest, or a relevant debt interest, that an entity had in the company; or

        * (ii) otherwise--what would have been such an interest if the company had been a loss company at that alteration time;

    * and these conditions are satisfied: 

      * (e) that last alteration time is before the day on which the _New Business Tax System (Consolidation, Value Shifting, Demergers and Other Measures) Act 2002_ received the Royal Assent; and

      * (f) the entity that owns the equity or debt immediately before the realisation event chooses to apply this section to the equity or debt, in relation to that last alteration time, instead of section 165115ZD of the _Income Tax Assessment Act 1997_; and

      * (g) the choice is made on or before the latest of these:

        * (i) the last day of the period of 6 months after the day referred to in paragraph (c) of this subsection;

        * (ii) the day on which the entity lodges its income tax return for the income year in which the realisation event occurred;

        * (iii) such later day as the Commissioner allows.

    * If the entity makes that choice, this section applies accordingly instead of that section.

    * (2) In addition to any application to the equity or debt, in relation to that last alteration time, that sections 165115ZA and 165115ZB of the _Income Tax Assessment Act 1997_ have apart from this section, those sections apply (and are taken always to have applied) to the equity or debt, in relation to that last alteration time, as if:

      * (a) the company had an adjusted unrealised loss at that time equal to the realised loss (see subsection (1) or (5), as appropriate, of this section) of this section, except so much of the loss as it is reasonable to conclude is attributable to _none_ of these:

        * (i) a notional capital loss, or a notional revenue loss, that the company has at that last alteration time in respect of a CGT asset;

        * (ii) a trading stock decrease in relation to that time for a CGT asset that was trading stock of the company at that time; and

      * (b) the company were therefore a loss company at that time; and

      * (c) that adjusted unrealised loss were the company's overall loss at that time.

    * (3) For the purposes of how sections 165115ZA and 165115ZB of the _Income Tax Assessment Act 1997_ apply because of this section, the adjustment amount under section 165115ZB of that Act is to be worked out and applied in accordance with subsection 165115ZB(6) (the nonformula method) of that Act.

    * (4) To avoid doubt:

      * (a) a notice need not be given under section 165115ZC of the _Income Tax Assessment Act 1997_ because of this section; and

      * (b) this section does not affect the requirements that apply to a notice that otherwise must be given under that section.

    * (5) If the equity or debt is a revenue asset at the time of the realisation event, subsection (2) applies on the basis that the realised loss is the total of:

      * (a) the loss (if any) realised for income tax purposes by the realisation event happening to the equity or debt in its character as a CGT asset; and

      * (b) the loss (if any) realised for income tax purposes by the realisation event happening to the equity or debt in its character as a revenue asset.

      * (a) section 707325 (which lets the available fraction for a bundle of losses be greater than it would otherwise be);

    * (9) Subsection 19765(3) of new Division 197 has effect in relation to each old Division 7B tainting amount component as if the reference to the amount of the franking debit that arose under section 19745 in relation to the transferred amount were instead a reference to the taxpaidbasis franking debit amount in relation to the old Division 7B tainting amount component.

    * (10) For the purpose of the notionally substituted paragraph, and of subsection (9) of this section, the **_taxpaidbasis franking debit amount_**, in relation to an old Division 7B tainting amount component, is the amount worked out in accordance with the formula:

    * Deficit on ceasing to be a franking entity deferred

    * (3) If an entity ceases to be a franking entity during a period of 12 months ending on 30 June in the year 2003 or a later year, a refund of income tax is taken to have been paid to it immediately before it ceased to be a franking entity, for the purposes of subsection 20525(3), if:

Method statement

        * Step 1.	Work out the total amount of franking deficit tax that is covered by paragraph (1)(a) and was incurred on or before the 30 June in the relevant year.

      * (a) subsection (3) or (4); or

      * (b) section 20570 of the _Income Tax Assessment Act 1997_;

    * that credit is not to be taken into account again in reducing another amount worked out under a step in such a method statement.

    * (6) The 30% reductions for an entity in steps 2 and 3 of the method statement in subsection (3), and in steps 1, 2, 3 and 4 of the method statement in subsection (4), apply only to franking deficit tax that is attributable to franking debits of the entity:

    * Relevant liabilities carried forward to the first income year

    * (2) Section 20570 of the _Income Tax Assessment Act 1997 _has effect in relation to the entity as if:

      * (a) so much of the relevant liabilities as were incurred by the entity during the first income year were liabilities to pay franking deficit tax under that Act; and

      * (b) so much of the relevant liabilities as were incurred by the entity before the start of the first income year were the excess mentioned in paragraph (1)(c) of that section.

    * (3) Subsection (2) has effect only for the purposes of working out:

      * (a) whether or not the entity is entitled to a tax offset under section 20570 of the _Income Tax Assessment Act 1997 _for the first income year or a later income year; and

          * Note: Section 2055 (with former sections 160APU and 160AQCNM of the _Income Tax Assessment Act 1936_) may affect whether the company had such a surplus at the end of 30 June 2002 and the amount of that surplus, but this section does not (because this section affects the company's exempting account balance only after then).

    * Class C exempting surplus at the end of 30 June 2002

          * Note: If the company's 200102 franking year ended at the end of 30 June 2002 and it would have had a class C exempting deficit at that time apart from former section 160AQCNO of the _Income Tax Assessment Act 1936_, that section will have eliminated the deficit and either:

##### 21415  Effect of a refund on franking returns

    * If no franking return is outstanding

    * (1) If:

      * (a) the entity receives a refund of income tax; and

       * 21945	Reversing (on tax paid basis) certain franking debits that arose before 1 July 2002

##### 21940  Reversing and replacing (on tax paid basis) certain franking credits that arose before 1 July 2002

    * (1) This section applies if:

      * (a) a franking credit arose before 1 July 2002 in the franking account of a life insurance company under former section 160APVJ of the _Income Tax Assessment Act 1936_ in relation to a PAYG instalment in respect of an income year; and

      * (b) the company's assessment day (the **_assessment day_**) for that income year occurs on or after 1 July 2002; and

      * (c) the company has a franking account (the **_new franking account_**) under section 20510 of the _Income Tax Assessment Act 1997_.

    * (2) A franking debit of the amount worked out in accordance with the following formula is taken to have arisen in the new franking account on the assessment day:

    * where: 

    * **_amount of the 1936 Act credit _**means the amount of the franking credit mentioned in paragraph (1)(a).

    * (3) On the assessment day, a franking credit of the amount mentioned in item 2 of the table in section 21915 of the _Income Tax Assessment Act 1997_ arises in the new franking account in relation to a payment of the PAYG instalment mentioned in paragraph (1)(a) of this section that was made before 1 July 2002.

          * Note: On the assessment day, the franking credit mentioned in paragraph (1)(a) is therefore:

        * reversed by the franking debit arising under subsection (2); and

        * replaced with a franking credit arising under subsection (3).

##### 21945  Reversing (on tax paid basis) certain franking debits that arose before 1 July 2002

    * (1) This section applies if:

      * (a) a franking debit arose before 1 July 2002 in the franking account of a life insurance company under former section 160AQCNCE of the _Income Tax Assessment Act 1936_ in relation to a PAYG instalment variation credit in respect of an income year; and

      * (b) the company's assessment day (the **_assessment day_**) for that income year occurs on or after 1 July 2002; and

      * (c) the company has a franking account (the **_new franking account_**) under section 20510 of the _Income Tax Assessment Act 1997_.

    * (2) A franking credit of the amount worked out in accordance with the following formula is taken to have arisen in the new franking account on 1 July 2002:

    * where: 

    * **_amount of the 1936 Act debit _**means the amount of the franking debit mentioned in paragraph (1)(a).

          * Note: As the effects of former sections 160AQCNCE and 160APVN of the _Income Tax Assessment Act 1936_ are not duplicated in the _Income Tax Assessment Act 1997_, this section ensures that a debit arising under former section 160AQCNCE before 1 July 2002 is reversed on a tax paid basis on that date if it has not been reversed under former section 160APVN before that date.

    * (1) If section 24710 does not apply, the total amount that is reasonably attributable to the capital protection for an income year is the greater of the amount worked out using section 24720 (the indicator method) and section 24725 (the percentage method). If those amounts are the same, use either one.

    * (2) If an arrangement involves more than one amount incurred in an income year, the total amount that is reasonably attributable to the capital protection for the year is distributed prorata between those amounts incurred.

##### 24720  The indicator method

    * (1) Work out the total amount incurred by the borrower under or in respect of the capital protected borrowing for the income year, ignoring amounts that are not in substance for capital protection or interest.

          * Example: Amounts that would be ignored under subsection (1) include amounts that are in substance the repayment of a loan or credit, the payment of an application fee or brokerage commission and the payment of stamp duty or other tax.

    * (2) Work out the amount that would have been incurred by applying the relevant indicator rate to a borrowing or provision of credit of the same amount for the income year.

    * (3) If the subsection (1) amount exceeds the subsection (2) amount, the excess is reasonably attributable to the capital protection for the income year.

    * (4) The relevant indicator rate is:

      * (a) for a capital protected borrowing based on a variable interest rate, the Reserve Bank of Australia's Indicator Rate for Personal Unsecured Loans--Variable Rate at the time the first payment for the income year was incurred; and

      * (b) for another capital protected borrowing, the Reserve Bank of 's Indicator Rate for Personal Unsecured Loans--Fixed Rate at the time the borrowing was entered into.

##### 24725  The percentage method

    * (1) Work out the total amount incurred by the borrower under or in respect of the capital protected borrowing for the income year, ignoring amounts that are not in substance for capital protection or interest.

          * Example: Amounts that would be ignored under subsection (1) include amounts that are in substance the repayment of a loan or credit, the payment of an application fee or brokerage commission and the payment of stamp duty or other tax.

    * (2) The amount that is reasonably attributable to the capital protection for the income year is this percentage of the total amount incurred for the income year:

      * (a) 40% if the term is 1 year or shorter; or

      * (b) 27.5% if the term is longer than 1 year but not longer than 2 years; or

      * (c) 20% if the term is longer than 2 years but not longer than 3 years; or

      * (d) 17.5% if the term is longer than 3 years but not longer than 4 years; or

      * (e) 15% if the term is longer than 4 years.

    * (1) For the purpose of working out whether you are a small business entity for the 200708, 200809, 200910 or 201011 income year (each a **_relevant income year_**) for the purposes of a provision to which subsection (3) applies:

    * (1) This section sets out what happens to your ordinary income and general deductions, and deductions under section 255 or 2510 of the _Income Tax Assessment Act 1997_, if:

      * (a) you are a small business entity for an income year and for the following income year (the **_changeover year_**); and

      * (b) you were using the STS accounting method for the income year before the changeover year; and

      * (c) you change to an accruals accounting method for the changeover year.

    * (2) This section also sets out what happens to your ordinary income and general deductions, and deductions under section 255 or 2510 of the _Income Tax Assessment Act 1997_, if:

      * (a) you are not a small business entity for an income year (also the **_changeover year_**); and

      * (b) you were using the STS accounting method for the income year before the changeover year; and

      * (c) you change to an accruals accounting method for the changeover year.

    * (3) Any ordinary income that, apart from paragraph 328105(1)(a) of the _Income Tax Assessment Act 1997 _(as in force immediately before its repeal by Schedule 2 to the _Tax Laws Amendment (2004 Measures No. 7) Act 2005_), you would have derived before the changeover year (while you were using the STS accounting method) and you have not included in your assessable income because you have not received it is included in your assessable income for the changeover year.

    * (4) Any general deductions, and deductions under section 255 or 2510 of the _Income Tax Assessment Act 1997_, that, apart from paragraph 328105(1)(b) of that Act (as in force immediately before its repeal by Schedule 2 to the _Tax Laws Amendment (2004 Measures No. 7) Act 2005_), you would have incurred before the changeover year (while you were using the STS accounting method) and that you have not deducted because you have not paid them can be deducted for the changeover year.

          * Example: You are a small business entity for the 200708 and 200809 income years and you continue to use the STS accounting method for those years. You are not a small business entity for the 200910 income year so you cannot continue to use the STS accounting method for that year. Because you cannot use the STS accounting method for the 200910 income year, you will not be able to use it again for a later income year even if you are a small business entity for that later year.

##### 328125  Meaning of STS accounting method

    * In sections 328115 and 328120, **_STS accounting method_** means the accounting method that was required by the _Income Tax Assessment Act 1997_ to be used by STS taxpayers for the 200405 income year.

    * (2) The choice has effect for the purposes of subsection 328175(3) of new Subdivision 328D.

      * (b) you:

        * (i) first used the asset, for a taxable purpose, at or after the 2015 budget time and on or before 30 June 2017; or

        * (ii) first installed the asset ready for use, for a taxable purpose, at or after the 2015 budget time and on or before 30 June 2017.

    * (5) Paragraph 328180(2)(a) or (3)(a) of the _Income Tax Assessment Act 1997_ applies to an amount included in the second element of the cost of an asset as if a reference in that paragraph to $1,000 were a reference to $20,000, if the amount is so included at any time:

    * (2) The opening pool balance of your general small business pool or long life small business pool for the 200708 income year is taken to be the closing pool balance of your general STS pool or long life STS pool, as the case requires, for the 200607 income year, reduced or increased by any adjustment required under section 328225 of new Subdivision 328D (about change in the business use of an asset).

      * (a) the closing pool balance of your general small business pool for the 201112 income year, reduced or increased by any adjustment required under section 328225 of that Act; and

      * (b) the closing pool balance of your long life small business pool for the 201112 income year, reduced or increased by any adjustment required under that section.

##### 328440  Taxpayers who left the STS on or after 1 July 2005

      * (a) the asset; and

    * to the extent that they would otherwise apply apart from this section to the partner for the event, do so apply to the partner for the event.

    * (2) The choice must be made by the later of:

      * (a) the day on which the head company must give the notice under section 70358 of the _Income Tax Assessment Act 1997_ (notice of choice to consolidate); and

      * (b) the end of 31 December 2005.

    * Agreement of other entities required in certain cases

    * (3) If the choice is to be made after the end of the period mentioned in paragraph (2)(a) and before the end of the day mentioned in paragraph (2)(b), it cannot be made unless each entity in relation to which the conditions in subsection (5) are satisfied has agreed to it being made.

    * Choice is irrevocable in certain circumstances

    * (4) The choice cannot be revoked unless:

      * (a) the revocation takes place before the end of 31 December 2005; and

      * (b) each entity in relation to which the conditions in subsection (5) are satisfied has agreed to the revocation.

    * (5) For the purposes of subsections (3) and (4), the conditions are that:

      * (a) the entity (the **_leaving entity_**) ceased to be a subsidiary member of the group before the choice was made (in a subsection (3) case) or before the revocation took place (in a subsection (4) case); and

      * (b) an asset became that of the leaving entity because section 7011 (the single entity rule) of the _Income Tax Assessment Act 1997_ ceased to apply when the leaving entity ceased to be a subsidiary member; and

      * (c) the asset had become that of the head company because that section applied when a chosen transitional entity (whether or not the same entity as the leaving entity) became a subsidiary member.

##### 7017  Working out the cost base or reduced cost base of a preCGT asset after certain rollovers

    * Section 716855 applies for the purposes of this Division in the same way as that section applies for the purposes of Part 390 of the _Income Tax Assessment Act 1997_.

##### 70110  Interpretation

    * A reference in this Division to: 

      * (a) a provision of the _Income Tax Assessment Act 1997_; or

      * (b) a consolidated group's allocable cost amount for an entity;

    * is a reference to that provision as it applies to the group, or to the allocable cost amount as it is worked out for the entity, in accordance with Subdivision 705B of that Act and with this Division.

##### Subdivision 701B--Modified application of provisions

##### Table of sections

       * 70115	Tax cost and trading stock value not set for assets of chosen transitional entities

       * 70120	Working out allocable cost amount on formation for subsidiary members other than chosen transitional entities

       * 70125	No operation of value shifting and loss transfer provisions to membership interests in chosen transitional entities

       * 70132	No adjustment of amount of liabilities required in working out allocable cost amount

       * 70135	Act, transaction or event giving rise to CGT event for preformation rollover after 16 May 2002 to be disregarded if cost base etc. would be different

       * 70140	When entity leaves transitional group, head company may choose, for purposes of transitional group's allocable cost amount, to increase terminating values of overdepreciated assets

       * 70145	When entity leaves transitional group, head company may choose, for purposes of transitional group's allocable cost amount, to use formation time market values, instead of terminating values, for certain preCGT assets

       * 70150	Increased allocable cost amount for leaving entity if it takes privatised asset brought into group by chosen transitional entity

##### 70115  Tax cost and trading stock value not set for assets of chosen transitional entities

    * Section 70110 (cost to head company of assets of joining entity) and subsection 70135(4) (setting value of trading stock at taxneutral amount) of the _Income Tax Assessment Act 1997_ do not apply to the assets of a chosen transitional entity.

          * Note: The fact that the head company inherits the entity's history under section 7015 of that Act when the entity becomes a subsidiary member of the group means that the entity's assets would be treated as having the same cost as they would for the entity at that time.

##### 70120  Working out allocable cost amount on formation for subsidiary members other than chosen transitional entities

    * When section applies

    * (1) This section applies if any of the transitional entities in the transitional group is a chosen transitional entity.

    * Allocable cost amount to be worked out in special way

    * (2) If this section applies, the group's allocable cost amount for each of the entities, other than a chosen transitional entity, that become subsidiary members when the group comes into existence (each of which is a **_nonchosen subsidiary_**) is worked out in a special way.

    * How to work out allocable cost amount

    * (3) The allocable cost amount for each nonchosen subsidiary is the sum of:

      * (a) the head company adjusted allocable amount for the nonchosen subsidiary (see subsection (4)); and

      * (b) for each subgroup (see subsection (6)) that exists in relation to the nonchosen subsidiary--the subgroup's notional allocable cost amount (see subsection(5)) for the nonchosen subsidiary.

    * Head company adjusted allocable amount

    * (4) The**_ head company adjusted allocable amount _**for the nonchosen subsidiary is the amount that would be the transitional group's allocable cost amount for that entity if;

      * (a) the holding of all subgroup membership interests were disregarded; and

      * (b) only the following proportion of each of the step 2 to step 7 amounts in the table in section 70560 of the _Income Tax Assessment Act 1997_ was taken into account:

      * where: 

      * **_		market value of all membership interests in nonchosen subsidiary _**means the market value, at the time the group comes into existence, of all membership interests in the nonchosen subsidiary that are held by entities that become members of the group at that time.

      * **_		market value of head company's direct and indirect membership interests in nonchosen subsidiary _**means the market value, at the time the group comes into existence, of all membership interests in the nonchosen subsidiary that the head company holds directly or indirectly through interposed entities that become subsidiary members of the group at that time and are not included in any subgroup in relation to the nonchosen subsidiary.

    * Subgroup's notional allocable cost amount

    * (5) For each subgroup that exists in relation to the nonchosen subsidiary, there is a **_subgroup's notional allocable cost amount_**. That amount is the amount that would be a consolidated group's allocable cost amount for the nonchosen subsidiary if:

      * (a) the consolidated group came into existence at the same time as the transitional group and consisted only of the nonchosen subsidiary and the entities comprising the subgroup; and

      * (b) the chosen transitional entity in the subgroup were the head company of the consolidated group; and

      * (c) the only membership interests that any entity held at or before that time in any other entity that became a member of the consolidated group were the subgroup membership interests (see subsection (6)) in relation to the subgroup, and any such entity held those membership interests during the period when it actually held them; and

      * (d) only the following proportion of each of the step 2 to step 7 amounts in the table in section 70560 of the _Income Tax Assessment Act 1997_ was taken into account:

      * where: 

      * **_		market value of all membership interests in nonchosen subsidiary _**means the market value, at the time the group comes into existence, of all membership interests in the nonchosen subsidiary that are held by entities that become members of the group at that time.

      * **_		market value of chosen transitional entity's direct and indirect membership interests in nonchosen subsidiary _**means the market value, at the time the group comes into existence, of all membership interests in the nonchosen subsidiary that the chosen transitional entity holds directly or indirectly through interposed entities that are included in the subgroup.

    * Subgroup and subgroup membership interests

    * (6) If a chosen transitional entity holds membership interests in a nonchosen subsidiary, either directly or indirectly through one or more other entities, each of which is a nonchosen subsidiary:

      * (a) the chosen transitional entity and each interposed nonchosen subsidiary comprise a **_subgroup_** in relation to the nonchosen subsidiary (unless the nonchosen subsidiary is included in a subgroup in relation to another nonchosen subsidiary); and

      * (b) the following membership interests are the **_subgroup membership interests_** in relation to the subgroup:

        * (i) the membership interests that the chosen transitional entity holds directly in the nonchosen subsidiary or in any of the interposed nonchosen subsidiaries;

        * (ii) the membership interests that each interposed nonchosen subsidiary holds directly in the nonchosen subsidiary or in any of the other interposed nonchosen subsidiaries.

##### 70125  No operation of value shifting and loss transfer provisions to membership interests in chosen transitional entities

    * If any provision of the _Income Tax Assessment Act 1997_ would, because of events that happened before the time the transitional group came into existence, apply to a CGT event that happens after that time to change the cost base or reduced cost base of the members' membership interests in a chosen transitional entity, the provision does not so apply.

          * Note: For example, such a provision could otherwise apply where a loss transfer or value shift involving the entity has occurred.

##### 70132  No adjustment of amount of liabilities required in working out allocable cost amount

    * (1) This section has effect for the purposes of applying section 70570 (step 2 of allocable cost amount) of the _Income Tax Assessment Act 1997_ in relation to a transitional entity.

    * (2) In spite of subsection 70570(1A) of that Act, if the amount of an accounting liability of the transitional entity would be different when it becomes an accounting liability of the transitional group, that difference is not taken into account in working out the amount of the liability.

##### 70135  Act, transaction or event giving rise to CGT event for preformation rollover after 16 May 2002 to be disregarded if cost base etc. would be different

    * (1) If:

      * (a) after 16 May 2002 and before the transitional group came into existence, a CGT event happened in relation to an asset (the **_rollover asset_**) for which there was:

        * (i) a rollover under Subdivision 126B of the _Income Tax Assessment Act 1997_; or

        * (ii) rollover relief under section 40340 of that Act in a case covered by item 4 of the table in subsection (1) of that section; and

      * (b) the cost base or reduced cost base of the rollover asset or any other asset that:

        * (i) became an asset of the head company when the transitional group came into existence because subsection 7011(1) (the single entity rule) of that Act applies; or

        * (ii) was otherwise an asset of the head company at that time;

      * differs at that time from what it would have been if the act, transaction or event that gave rise to the CGT event had not occurred in relation to the rollover asset;

    * then the provisions mentioned in subsection (2) apply as if the act, transaction or event had not occurred in relation to the rollover asset.

    * (2) The provisions are:

      * (a) Division 705 of the _Income Tax Assessment Act 1997_; and

      * (b) provisions of this Act modifying the effect of that Division.

    * (2A) Subsection (1) does not apply if:

      * (a) the act, transaction or event mentioned in subsection (1) happened before a demerger and in connection with the demerger; and

      * (b) before the transitional group came into existence, at least one of the following entities ceased to be a member of the demerger group because of the demerger:

        * (i) the originating company in relation to the rollover, or the transferor in relation to the rollover relief;

        * (ii) the recipient company, or the transferee in relation to the rollover relief; and

      * (c) when the transitional group came into existence, at least one of those entities was _not_ a member of that group.

    * (3) Subsection (1) does not apply if:

      * (a) the rollover asset is a membership interest in an entity (the **_test entity_**); and

      * (b) when the CGT event happened:

        * (i) the originating company in relation to the rollover, or the transferor in relation to the rollover relief, was a foreign resident; and

        * (ii) the recipient company, or the transferee in relation to the rollover relief, was an Australian resident; and

      * (c) when the transitional group came into existence, the test entity was a subsidiary member of the group, other than as a transitional foreignheld subsidiary of the group.

##### 70140  When entity leaves transitional group, head company may choose, for purposes of transitional group's allocable cost amount, to increase terminating values of overdepreciated assets

    * (1) This section applies if an entity ceases to be a subsidiary member of the transitional group and the requirements of subsections (2) to (4) are satisfied.

    * Asset held at leaving time

    * (2) Just before the entity ceases to be a subsidiary member, it must, disregarding subsection 7011(1) (the single entity rule) of the _Income Tax Assessment Act 1997_, hold an asset.

    * Reduction of asset's tax cost setting amount for overdepreciation

    * (3) When the transitional group came into existence:

      * (a) the asset must have become that of the head company of the transitional group because subsection 7011(1) of that Act applied in relation to a transitional entity; and

      * (b) former section 70550 of that Act must have reduced by an amount (the **_reduction amount_**) the tax cost setting amount for the asset.

    * Asset held continuously within group

    * (4) The asset must, disregarding subsection 7011(1) of that Act, have been held at all times by the head company or a subsidiary member of the transitional group from when the transitional group came into existence until the entity ceases to be a subsidiary member of the transitional group.

    * Head company's choice

    * (6) If this section applies, the head company may, in relation to the entity's ceasing to be a subsidiary member, choose that the terminating value for the asset, that is to be used in applying step 1 of the table in section 71120 of the _Income Tax Assessment Act 1997_, is increased by so much of the reduction amount as the head company chooses.

##### 70145  When entity leaves transitional group, head company may choose, for purposes of transitional group's allocable cost amount, to use formation time market values, instead of terminating values, for certain preCGT assets

    * (1) This section applies if:

      * (a) an entity ceases to be a subsidiary member of the transitional group; and

      * (b) just before the transitional group came into existence, the entity that became the head company held a preCGT asset; and

      * (c) that holding of the asset did not occur as a result of a CGT event:

        * (i) for which there was a rollover under Subdivision 126B of the _Income Tax Assessment Act 1997_; and

        * (ii) that occurred after  by legal time in the  on 21 September 1999; and

      * (d) just before the entity ceases to be a subsidiary member of the group, the asset is still a preCGT asset and is held by the head company only because the entity is taken by subsection 7011(1) (the single entity rule) of the _Income Tax Assessment Act 1997 _to be a part of the head company.

    * (2) If this section applies, the head company may, in relation to the entity's ceasing to be a subsidiary member, choose that the terminating value for the asset, that is to be used in applying step 1 of the table in section 71120 of the _Income Tax Assessment Act 1997_, is equal to its market value just before the transitional group came into existence.

##### 70150  Increased allocable cost amount for leaving entity if it takes privatised asset brought into group by chosen transitional entity

    * Application

    * (1) This section provides for an addition to the step 1 amount for working out under section 71120 of the _Income Tax Assessment Act 1997_ the allocable cost amount for an entity (the **_leaving entity_**) that ceases to be a subsidiary member of the transitional group at a time (the **_leaving time_**), if:

      * (a) the head company of the group holds an asset at the leaving time because the leaving entity is taken by subsection 7011(1) of that Act to be a part of the head company; and

      * (b) the head company started to hold the asset because of that subsection when a chosen transitional entity became a subsidiary member of the group.

    * If entity sale situation affected asset's cost for chosen transitional entity

    * (2) If:

      * (a) at a time before the chosen transitional entity became a subsidiary member of the transitional group:

        * (i) all of that entity's ordinary income and statutory income was not assessable income; and

        * (ii) that entity held the asset; and

      * (b) just after that time, some or all of that entity's ordinary income and statutory income became assessable income because another entity that later became a member of the transitional group purchased all the membership interests in the entity; and

      * (c) the amount of the purchase price reasonably attributable to the asset exceeded the amount worked out under subsection (3);

    * the excess is added to the step 1 amount.

    * (3) Work out the amount for the purposes of paragraph (2)(c) using the following table:

    * If asset sale situation affected asset's cost for chosen transitional entity

    * (4) If:

      * (a) on or after 4 August 1997, an entity (whether the chosen transitional entity or another entity) acquired the asset in connection with the acquisition of a business from the tax exempt vendor (within the meaning of those terms given by Division 58 of the _Income Tax Assessment Act 1997_, as that Division applied to the acquisition); and

      * (b) because of the acquisition, that Division directly or indirectly affected how much the chosen transitional entity could deduct for the asset; and

      * (c) that effect was partly due to the amount described in an item of the table being worked out for that entity directly or indirectly by reference to a provision of that Division specified in the item; and

      * (d) that amount is less than it would have been apart from that provision;

    * the difference is added to the step 1 amount.

          * Note 1: As originally enacted, Division 58 of the _Income Tax Assessment Act 1997_ applied to acquisitions on or after 4 August 1997. That Act was later amended to replace Division 58, with the replacement Division 58 applying to acquisitions on or after 1 July 2001.

          * Note 2: Division 58 of the _Income Tax Assessment Act 1997 _may, for example, have _indirectly_ affected how much the chosen transitional entity could deduct for the asset because:

           * (a) that Division affected the amount that could be deducted by an entity that held the asset before the chosen transitional entity; and

           * (b) that effect extended to the chosen transitional entity because of rollover relief.

      * (b) a person or persons continued to be the majority owners (see subsection (2)) of the entity from the start of 27 June 2002 until the entity became a subsidiary member of the group;

    * the entity is a **_continuing majorityowned entity _**and the group is the entity's **_designated group_**.

    * Majority owners of an entity

    * (2) A person or persons are the **_majority owners_** of an entity if they beneficially own, directly or indirectly through one or more interposed entities, membership interests in the entity whose market value is more than 50% of the market value of all of the membership interests in the entity.

    * Interposed nonfixed trust to be treated as fixed trust

    * (3) For the purposes of subsection (2), if the interposed entity or any of the interposed entities is a trust that is not a fixed trust:

      * (a) it is treated as if it were a fixed trust; and

      * (b) all of its objects are treated as if they were beneficiaries of that trust with equal interests in it.

##### 701A5  Modified application of Part 390 of Income Tax Assessment Act 1997 to trading stock of continuing majorityowned entity

    * (1) The operation of Part 390 of the _Income Tax Assessment Act 1997 _is modified in accordance with this section in relation to each asset of a continuing majorityowned entity that is trading stock just before the entity becomes a subsidiary member of the entity's designated group.

    * Continuing majorityowned entity to revalue its trading stock under normal provisions

    * (2) For the entity core purposes:

      * (a) subsection 70135(4) of the _Income Tax Assessment Act 1997 _does not apply in relation to the asset; and

      * (b) instead, the value of the asset at the end of the income year that ends, or, if section 70130 of that Act applies, of the income year that is taken by subsection (3) of that section to end, is the value determined in accordance with sections 7045 to 7070 of that Act.

    * For head company, trading stock to be retained cost base asset with tax cost setting amount equal to entity's yearend valuation

    * (3) For the head company core purposes when the continuing majorityowned entity becomes a subsidiary member of the designated group, the asset is a retained cost base asset whose tax cost setting amount is equal to the value applicable in accordance with paragraph (2)(b).

##### 701A7  Modified application of Part 390 of Income Tax Assessment Act 1997 to registered emissions units of continuing majorityowned entity

    * (1) The operation of Part 390 of the _Income Tax Assessment Act 1997_ is modified in accordance with this section in relation to each asset of a continuing majorityowned entity that is a registered emissions unit just before the entity becomes a subsidiary member of the entity's designated group.

    * Continuing majorityowned entity to revalue its registered emissions units under normal provisions

    * (2) For the entity core purposes:

      * (a) subsection 70135(5) of the _Income Tax Assessment Act 1997_ does not apply in relation to the asset; and

      * (b) instead, the value of the asset at the end of the income year that ends, or, if section 70130 of that Act applies, of the income year that is taken by subsection (3) of that section to end, is the value determined in accordance with sections 42051 to 42058 of that Act.

    * For head company, registered emissions units to be retained cost base asset with tax cost setting amount equal to entity's yearend valuation

    * (3) For the head company core purposes when the continuing majorityowned entity becomes a subsidiary member of the designated group, the asset is a retained cost base asset whose tax cost setting amount is equal to the value applicable in accordance with paragraph (2)(b).

##### 701A10  Modified application of Part 390 of Income Tax Assessment Act 1997 to certain internally generated assets of continuing majorityowned entity

    * (1) This section applies if:

      * (a) because subsection 7011(1) (the single entity rule) of the _Income Tax Assessment Act 1997_ applies, a depreciating asset becomes that of the head company of a continuing majorityowned entity's designated group when the entity becomes a subsidiary member of that group; and

      * (b) the continuing majorityowned entity's terminating value for the asset is less than the asset's tax cost setting amount; and

      * (c) the asset existed at the start of 27 June 2002; and

      * (d) more than half of the expenditure incurred in constructing or creating the asset was of a revenue nature and allowable as a deduction to the entity (whether or not the continuing majorityowned entity) that constructed or created the asset; and

      * (e) for every balancing adjustment event occurring for the asset before the continuing majorityowned entity became a subsidiary member of the group, there was rollover relief under section 40340 of the _Income Tax Assessment Act 1997_.

    * Reduced depreciation deductions etc. for head company

    * _	_(2)	If this section applies, for the head company core purposes:

      * (a) while the asset is, because subsection 7011(1) of that Act applies, that of the head company of the designated group, for the purpose of working out deductions for the asset's decline in value under Division 40 of the _Income Tax Assessment Act 1997_, its tax cost setting amount is taken to be equal to the continuing majorityowned entity's terminating value for the asset; and

      * (b) if a balancing adjustment event occurs for the asset, or the head company ceases to hold the asset because an entity ceases to be a subsidiary member of the group, and:

        * (i) the deductions for its decline in value up to that time worked out on the basis in paragraph (a);

      * are less than: 

        * (ii) the deductions that would have been worked out using its actual tax cost setting amount;

      * then: 

        * (iii) if a balancing adjustment event occurs for the asset--the shortfall is allowable as a deduction to the head company for the income year in which it ceases to hold the asset; or

        * (iv) if the head company ceases to hold the asset because an entity ceases to be a subsidiary member of the group--the group's allocable cost amount worked out under section 71130 of the _Income Tax Assessment Act 1997 _for the entity is increased by the shortfall.

           * Note: The asset's actual tax cost setting amount would be used for the purpose of working out any balancing adjustment for a balancing adjustment event or for working out the terminating value of the asset under Division 711 of the _Income Tax Assessment Act 1997_.

    * Reduced depreciation deductions etc. for acquirer from head company

    * _	_(3)	If:

      * (a) the asset is acquired by another entity (a **_new asset holder_**) from the head company; and

      * (b) at the time of the acquisition:

        * (i) either party to the acquisition controls (for value shifting purposes) the other; or

        * (ii) a third entity controls (for value shifting purposes) the parties to the acquisition; and

      * (c) the following amount:

        * (i) the asset's adjustable value (the **_rollover adjustable value_**) just before the acquisition, worked out on the assumption that the head company had acquired the asset for an amount equal to the continuing majorityowned entity's terminating value for the asset;

      * is less than: 

        * (ii) the asset's cost to the new asset holder;

    * then the consequences in subsection (4) occur.

    * _	_(4)	The consequences are as follows:

      * (a) while the asset is held by the new asset holder, for the purpose of working out deductions for the asset's decline in value under Division 40 of the _Income Tax Assessment Act 1997_, the acquisition by the new asset holder is taken to have been for an amount equal to the asset's rollover adjustable value;

      * (b) if a balancing adjustment event occurs for the asset and:

        * (i) the deductions for its decline in value up to that time, worked out on the basis in paragraph (a);

      * are less than: 

        * (ii) the deductions that would otherwise have been worked out;

      * then the shortfall is allowable as a deduction to the new asset holder for the income year in which it ceases to hold the asset.

    * Reduced depreciation deductions etc. for entity that ceases to be a subsidiary member

    * _	_(5)	If:

      * (a) the asset becomes that of an entity (a **_new asset holder_**) other than the head company because subsection 7011(1) of the _Income Tax Assessment Act 1997_ ceases to apply when the entity ceases to be a subsidiary member of the designated group as a result of a third entity (the **_buyer of the new asset holder_**) acquiring some or all of the membership interests in the new asset holder; and

      * (b) at the time of the acquisition:

        * (i) the buyer of the new asset holder controls (for value shifting purposes) the head company of the designated group, or vice versa; or

        * (ii) a third entity controls (for value shifting purposes) the head company of the designated group and the buyer of the new asset holder; and

      * (c) the following amount:

      * is less than: 

        * (ii) the asset's cost to the new asset holder;

    * then the consequences in subsection (6) occur.

    * _	_(6)	The consequences are as follows:

      * (a) while the asset is held by the new asset holder, for the purpose of working out deductions for the asset's decline in value under Division 40 of the _Income Tax Assessment Act 1997_, the acquisition by the new asset holder is taken to have been for an amount equal to the asset's rollover adjustable value; and

      * (b) if a balancing adjustment event occurs for the asset and:

        * (i) the deductions for its decline in value up to that time worked out on the basis in paragraph (a);

      * are less than: 

        * (ii) the deductions that would otherwise have been worked out;

      * (c) before the end of the fourth income year of the head company of the group ending after the entity became a subsidiary member of the group, the entity ceases to be a subsidiary member; and

      * (d) all of the assets, other than those excepted under subsection (2), that the head company held when the entity became a subsidiary member, because the entity was taken by subsection 7011(1) (the single entity principle) of the _Income Tax Assessment Act 1997_ to be a part of the head company, continued to be held by the head company until the entity ceased to be a subsidiary member.

    * Excepted assets

    * Additional requirement for consolidatable groups

    * (6) If the group is a consolidatable group, the test time must be before 1 July 2004.

    * Additional requirement for consolidated groups at formation

##### 701C15  Additional membership rules where entities are interposed between the head company and a subsidiary member--case where an interposed entity is a foreign resident and the subsidiary member is a trust or partnership

    * (1) This section describes, for the purposes of item 2, column 4 of the table in subsection 70315(2) of the _Income Tax Assessment Act 1997_, a set of requirements that must be met for an entity (the **_test entity_**) to be a subsidiary member of a consolidated group or a consolidatable group at a particular time (the **_test time_**).

          * Note: This subsection applies in relation to a MEC group as if the reference to item 2, column 4 of the table in subsection 70315(2) of the _Income Tax Assessment Act 1997_ were a reference to subparagraph 71910(1)(b)(iii) of that Act (see subsection 7192(3) of this Act).

    * Test entity must be a subsidiary member on assumption that head company beneficially owned all membership interests beneficially owned by subsection (3) companies

    * (4) At the test time, it must be the case that the test entity would be a subsidiary member of the group if the head company beneficially owned all the membership interests beneficially owned by each company described in subsection (3).

##### 701C20  Transitional foreignheld subsidiaries and transitional foreignheld indirect subsidiaries

    * If: 

      * (a) an entity is a subsidiary member of a consolidated group in a case where the set of requirements described in section 701C10 are met; and

    * then: 

      * (c) the entity is a **_transitional foreignheld subsidiary_** of the group; and

      * (d) if:

        * (i) the transitional foreignheld subsidiary; or

        * (ii) an entity that is a transitional foreignheld indirect subsidiary of the group because of another application of this paragraph;

      * holds one or more membership interests in another entity that:

  * Basic modification

       * 701C30	Transitional foreignheld subsidiary to be treated as part of head company

  * Other modifications

       * 701C40	Cost setting rules for exit cases--modification of core rules

       * 701C50	Cost setting rules for exit cases--reference to modification of core rule

##### Application and object

##### 701C25  Application and object of this Subdivision

    * Application

    * (1) This Subdivision applies if an entity (the **_transitional foreignheld joining entity_**) that is a transitional foreignheld subsidiary or a transitional foreignheld indirect subsidiary becomes a subsidiary member of a consolidated group at the time (the **_formation time_**) the group comes into existence.

    * Object

    * (2) The object of this Subdivision is to ensure that, on becoming a subsidiary member at the formation time, the tax cost of the assets of any transitional foreignheld subsidiary is not set and that the tax cost setting amount for assets of any transitional foreignheld indirect subsidiary that becomes a subsidiary member at that time takes account of this.

##### Basic modification

##### 701C30  Transitional foreignheld subsidiary to be treated as part of head company

    * The following provisions: 

      * (a) section 70110 of the _Income Tax Assessment Act 1997 _(about setting the tax cost of assets that an entity brings into the group);

      * (b) Subdivision 705A of that Act, in its application in accordance with Subdivision 705B of that Act;

    * apply, for the purposes of setting the tax cost of an asset of the transitional foreignheld joining entity at the formation time, as if each subsidiary member of the group that is a transitional foreignheld subsidiary at the formation time were a part of the head company of the group, rather than a separate entity.

          * Note 1: This section means that references in those provisions to matters internal to the group operate as if transitional foreignheld subsidiaries in the group were parts of the head company of the group. For example:

           * (a) provisions operating if the head company holds (whether directly or indirectly) membership interests in another entity operate even if a transitional foreignheld subsidiary actually holds those interests; and

           * (b) provisions operating if the head company owns or controls another entity operate even if one or more transitional foreignheld subsidiaries actually own or control that other entity; and

           * (c) provisions operating if an entity is interposed between the head company and another entity operate even if the first entity is actually interposed between a transitional foreignheld subsidiary and the other entity.

          * Note 2: If the transitional foreignheld joining entity is a transitional foreignheld subsidiary, this section means the assets of the entity do not have their tax cost reset at the formation time. This is because Subdivision 705A of the _Income Tax Assessment Act 1997_, in its application in accordance with Subdivision 705B of that Act, resets the tax cost of assets of _subsidiary _members of a group, but not assets of the head company.

##### Other modifications

##### 701C35  Trading stock value not set for assets of transitional foreignheld subsidiaries

    * Subsection 70135(4) of the _Income Tax Assessment Act 1997 _(setting value of trading stock at taxneutral amount) does not apply to the assets of the transitional foreignheld joining entity if it is a transitional foreignheld subsidiary.

##### 701C40  Cost setting rules for exit cases--modification of core rules

    * Section 70115 of the _Income Tax Assessment Act 1997 _applies as if the following subsection were added at the end of the section:

    * Application to transitional foreignheld subsidiaries

    * (4) If an entity that ceases to be a subsidiary member is a transitional foreignheld subsidiary when it does so:

      * (a) this section applies to each membership interest in the transitional foreignheld subsidiary that is held by an entity (an **_eligible nonresident_**) of a kind mentioned in subparagraph 701C20(b)(i), (ii), (iii) or (iv) of the _Income Tax (Transitional Provisions) Act 1997_ in the same way as it applies to a membership interest in the transitional foreignheld subsidiary that is held by the head company; and

      * (b) for that purpose, the definition of **_head company core purposes_** in subsection 7011(2) of the _Income Tax Assessment Act 1997 _applies to the eligible nonresident in the same way as it applies to the head company.

##### 701C50  Cost setting rules for exit cases--reference to modification of core rule

    * Section 7115 of the _Income Tax Assessment Act 1997 _applies as if the following note were added at the end of the section:

          * Note: If the leaving entity is a transitional foreignheld subsidiary (within the meaning of section 701C20 of the _Income Tax (Transitional Provisions) Act 1997)_, this Division will, in accordance with subsection 70115(4) of this Act (see section 701C40 of the firstmentioned Act), apply to membership interests that an eligible nonresident mentioned in that subsection holds in the entity in the same way as it applies to membership interests that the head company holds in the entity.

##### Subdivision 701DA--Object of this Division

##### Table of sections

       * 701D1	Object of this Division

##### 701D1  Object of this Division

    * (1) The object of this Division is to allow an entity that is a potential subsidiary member of a consolidated group to utilise an overall foreign loss (as defined in former section 160AFD of the _Income Tax Assessment Act 1936_) during a transitional period, rather than have the head company utilise the loss subject to the restrictions in Subdivision 707C of the _Income Tax Assessment Act 1997_.

    * (2) Therefore, this Division allows the head company to prevent the entity from being a subsidiary member of the group, for a transitional period.

##### Subdivision 701DB--Rules allowing transitional foreign loss makers to remain outside consolidated group

##### Table of sections

       * 701D10	Transitional foreign loss maker not member of group if certain conditions satisfied

       * 701D15	Choice to apply transitional rules to entity

##### 701D10  Transitional foreign loss maker not member of group if certain conditions satisfied

    * (1) The _Income Tax Assessment Act 1997 _and this Act have effect as if an entity (the **_transitional foreign loss maker_**) is not a subsidiary member of a consolidated group at a particular time (the **_transitional time_**) if:

      * (a) the group came into existence at a particular time (the **_formation time_**) before 1 July 2004; and

      * (b) apart from this section, the transitional foreign loss maker would be a subsidiary member of the group at the transitional time; and

      * (c) the transitional time is not later than 3 years after the formation time; and

      * (d) the head company of the group has made a choice under section 701D15 to apply this section to the transitional foreign loss maker; and

      * (e) the continuous ownership condition in subsection (2) is satisfied; and

      * (f) the foreign loss condition in subsection (3) is satisfied; and

      * (g) the nosubsidiary condition in subsection (4) is satisfied.

    * Continuous ownership condition

    * (2) The continuous ownership condition is satisfied if the transitional foreign loss maker was a whollyowned subsidiary of the entity that became the head company of the group throughout the period:

      * (a) beginning at the start of 1 July 2002; and

      * (b) ending at the transitional time.

    * Foreign loss condition

    * (3) The foreign loss condition is satisfied if:

      * (a) the transitional foreign loss maker incurred an overall foreign loss (as defined in former section 160AFD of the _Income Tax Assessment Act 1936_) in respect of the 200102 income year or an earlier income year; and

      * (b) the amount of the overall foreign loss has not been fully taken into account under one or more applications of former section 160AFD of the _Income Tax Assessment Act 1936_ to the transitional foreign loss maker in relation to an income year or income years ending before the transitional time; and

      * (c) assuming that the transitional foreign loss maker had become a subsidiary member of a consolidated group at the formation time, as a result all or part of the overall foreign loss would have been transferred at that time to the head company of the group under Division 707 of the _Income Tax Assessment Act 1997_.

    * Nosubsidiary condition

    * (4) The nosubsidiary condition is satisfied if, at the transitional time:

      * (a) the transitional foreign loss maker does not hold any membership interests in any other entity; or

      * (b) both of the following conditions are satisfied:

        * (i) the transitional foreign loss maker holds one or more membership interests in one or more other entities;

        * (ii) assuming that the head company of the group (rather than the transitional foreign loss maker) held that interest or those interests, none of those other entities would be a subsidiary member of the group.

    * Transitional foreign loss maker stays in consolidatable group

    * (5) To avoid doubt, subsection (1) does not prevent the transitional foreign loss maker from being a member of a consolidatable group at the transitional time for the purposes of:

      * (a) subsection 12650(6) of the _Income Tax Assessment Act 1997_; and

      * (b) paragraph705(2A)(b) and 170105(2A)(b) of that Act; and

      * (c) subparagraph 820599(1)(b)(iii) of that Act.

##### 701D15  Choice to apply transitional rules to entity

    * (1) The head company of a consolidated group may make a choice in the approved form to apply section 701D10 to another entity.

    * (2) However, the head company cannot make that choice if subsection 701D10(1) previously prevented the entity from being a subsidiary member of a consolidated group.

    * (3) The choice must be made by the later of:

      * (a) the day on which the head company must give the notice under section 70358 of the _Income Tax Assessment Act 1997_ (notice of choice to consolidate); and

      * (b) 30 days after the _Taxation Laws Amendment Act (No. 1) 2004 _received the Royal Assent.

    * (4) The choice cannot be revoked.

#### Division 702--Modified application of this Act to assets that an entity brings into a consolidated group

##### Table of sections

       * 7021	Modified application of section 4077 of this Act to assets that an entity brings into a consolidated group

       * 7024	Extended operation of subsection 40285(3)

       * 7025	Modified application of subsection 40285(6) of this Act after entity brings assets into consolidated group

##### 7021  Modified application of section 4077 of this Act to assets that an entity brings into a consolidated group

    * (1) This section applies if:

      * (a) an entity becomes a subsidiary member of a consolidated group; and

      * (b) just before it does so, section 4077 of this Act applies to an asset that it holds.

    * (2) For so long as the asset continues to be:

      * (a) an asset of the head company because subsection 7011(1) (the single entity rule) of the _Income Tax Assessment Act 1997_ applies; or

      * (b) an asset of another entity, where it became such an asset as a result of that subsection ceasing to apply on the entity ceasing to be a subsidiary member of the group;

    * then, despite certain provisions of that Act applying, in accordance with subsection 70155(2) of that Act, as if the asset were acquired for a payment equal to its tax cost setting amount:

      * (c) subsection 4077(1) continues to apply to the asset; and

           * Note: This means that Division 40 of the _Income Tax Assessment Act 1997_ continues not to apply to an asset that is a mining, quarrying or prospecting right.

      * (d) subsection 4077(2) continues to apply to the asset, but applies as if the reference in that subsection to the cost of the asset were a reference to the cost worked out on the basis that the asset were acquired for a payment equal to its tax cost setting amount; and

      * (e) subsection 4077(3) continues to apply to the asset, but applies as if the reference in that subsection to the amount included in assessable income under subsection 40285(1) of that Act were a reference to the amount so worked out on the basis that the asset were acquired for a payment equal to its tax cost setting amount.

##### 7024  Extended operation of subsection 40285(3)

    * (1) This section applies in relation to a balancing adjustment event that occurs:

      * (a) for a depreciating asset held by an entity (the **_final entity_**); and

      * (b) after the asset became an asset of the head company of a consolidated group because of section 7011 (the single entity rule) of the _Income Tax Assessment Act 1997_ applying when an entity became a subsidiary member of the group.

    * It does not matter whether or not the final entity is the same as the head company or the entity mentioned in paragraph (b).

          * Note: The final entity will be different from the head company if an entity (the **_leaving entity_**) took the asset with it when leaving the group, whether or not the leaving entity brought the asset into another consolidated group before the asset came to be held by the final entity.

    * (2) The final entity is entitled to a further deduction under subsection 40285(3) of this Act for the balancing adjustment event if the final entity would have been entitled to the deduction apart from paragraph 70155(2)(a) of the _Income Tax Assessment Act 1997_ operating at any time before the event occurred.

          * Note: The final entity will be entitled to the deduction apart from paragraph 70155(2)(a) of the _Income Tax Assessment Act 1997_ only if the entity is treated as having depreciated the asset under former Division 42 of that Act, because of section 7015 (the entry history rule) of that Act and perhaps also section 70140 (the exit history rule) of that Act.

    * (3) However, the final entity is not entitled to the deduction if, at a time before the balancing adjustment event occurred:

      * (a) the asset became the asset of the head company of a consolidated group because of section 7011 (the single entity rule) of the _Income Tax Assessment Act 1997_ applying when an entity (the **_joining entity_**) became a subsidiary member of the group; and

      * (b) the tax cost setting amount for the asset was more than the joining entity's terminating value for the asset.

    * It does not matter whether or not the change in status of the asset described in paragraph (a) of this subsection is the same change as the change in status of the asset described in paragraph (1)(b).

          * Note: In some cases, section 70547 of the _Income Tax Assessment Act 1997_ reduces the tax cost setting amount for a depreciating asset to the joining entity's terminating value for the asset, so that subsection (3) of this section will not prevent the final entity from getting the further deduction under subsection 40285(3) of this Act.

##### 7025  Modified application of subsection 40285(6) of this Act after entity brings assets into consolidated group

    * If: 

      * (a) an entity becomes a subsidiary member of a consolidated group; and

      * (b) because subsection 7011(1) (the single entity rule) of the _Income Tax Assessment Act 1997_ applies, an asset of the entity becomes an asset of the head company of the group; and

      * (c) a balancing adjustment event happens in relation to the asset while it is an asset of the head company;

    * subsection 40285(6) of this Act (about reducing the amount included in assessable income for a balancing adjustment event) applies as if the cost of the asset were equal to the tax cost setting amount applicable in relation to the asset for the purposes of having its tax cost set by section 70110 (cost to head company of assets that entity brings into group) of the _Income Tax Assessment Act 1997_.

          * Note: The tax cost setting amount applicable in relation to the asset for that purpose is worked out in accordance with Division 705 of the _Income Tax Assessment Act 1997._

##### 70330  Debt interests that are not membership interests

    * (1) For the purposes of Part 390 of the _Income Tax Assessment Act 1997_, this section affects whether an interest or right that is held by an entity on or after 1 July 2002 and relates to another entity is a membership interest of the entity in the other entity.

    * (2) Apply Division 974 of the _Income Tax Assessment Act 1997_ in determining under Subdivision 960G of that Act whether the interest or right is a membership interest of the entity in the other entity.

          * Note: Under Subdivision 960G of the _Income Tax Assessment Act 1997_, a debt interest relating to an entity is not a membership interest in the entity. Division 974 of that Act explains what a debt interest is.

    * (3) This section has effect whether or not the debt and equity test amendments (as defined in item 118 of Schedule 1 to the _New Business Tax System (Debt and Equity) Act 2001_) apply to transactions in relation to the interest or right at the relevant time.

##### 70335  Employee share schemes

##### 705300  Application and object of this Subdivision

    * (1) If an entity (the **_joining entity_**) to which section 4075 of this Act applied becomes a subsidiary member of a consolidated group at a time (the **_joining time_**), this Subdivision applies in relation to:

      * (a) depreciating assets that:

        * (i) caused section 4075 of this Act to apply to the joining entity; and

        * (ii) became assets of the head company of the group at the joining time because of section 7011 (Single entity rule) of the _Income Tax Assessment Act 1997_ operating in relation to the joining entity; and

      * (b) notional assets that sections 4035, 4037, 4040 and 4043 of this Act treat an entity as holding because of expenditure relating to such depreciating assets;

    * to affect the operation of Division 40, section 70155 and Division 705 of that Act.

    * (2) The main object of this Subdivision is to ensure that entities are allowed only an appropriate amount of deductions in connection with such depreciating assets and such expenditure.

##### 705305  Rules affecting depreciating assets

    * (1) The main object of this section is to ensure that a depreciating asset's tax cost is set, and other matters relevant to working out the deductions of the head company of the consolidated group for the decline in value of the asset are dealt with, so as to:

      * (a) ensure that the head company does not get excessive deductions on account of expenditure (by any entity) relating to the asset; and

      * (b) reflect the deductions of an entity for a period ending before the joining time for expenditure relating to the asset; and

      * (c) ensure that the effective life of the asset for the head company reflects the rate or rates at which the joining entity was able to deduct expenditure relating to the asset (whether or not the expenditure formed part of the cost of the asset).

    * Prime cost method of working out decline in value of asset

    * (2) If the joining entity could not deduct an amount under Subdivision 40B of the _Income Tax Assessment Act 1997_ for the income year that includes the joining time for the decline in value of a depreciating asset, subsection 70155(2) of that Act has effect as if the prime cost method for working out the decline in value of the asset applied just before the joining time.

          * Note: This may affect both the method of working out the decline in value of the asset and the asset's effective life.

    * Adjustable value of asset

    * (3) Division 705 of the _Income Tax Assessment Act 1997_ has effect as if the adjustable value of a depreciating asset just before and at the joining time were increased by the amount described in subsection (4), if section 4035, 4037, 4040 or 4043 treated the joining entity as holding a notional asset.

          * Note: This affects not only the adjustable value of the depreciating asset but also the joining entity's terminating value for the asset (which section 70530 of that Act defines as being equal to the asset's adjustable value just before the joining time).

    * (4) The amount of the increase is so much of the adjustable value of the notional asset just before the joining time as reasonably relates to the depreciating asset.

    * Cost of asset

    * (5) Division 705 of the _Income Tax Assessment Act 1997_ has effect as if the cost of a depreciating asset were increased by expenditure incurred that did not form part of the asset's cost worked out under Division 40 of that Act but would have if it had been incurred just before the joining time under a contract entered into after 30 June 2001.

    * Earlier deductions for decline in value of asset

    * (6) Division 705 of the _Income Tax Assessment Act 1997_ has effect as if deductions relating to expenditure described in subsection (5) were deductions for the decline in value of the depreciating asset.

          * Example: Such deductions include:

           * (a) deductions under former Subdivision 330A, 330C or 330H of the _Income Tax Assessment Act 1997_, or a corresponding previous law, for the expenditure; and

           * (b) deductions under Division 40 of that Act for the decline in value of a notional asset that section 4035, 4037, 4040 or 4043 of this Act treated an entity as holding because of the expenditure.

    * Effective life of asset

    * (7) If a depreciating asset's tax cost setting amount does not exceed the joining entity's terminating value for the asset, Division 40 of the _Income Tax Assessment Act 1997_ has effect as if the effective life of the asset were such period as is reasonable, having regard to the following:

      * (a) the remainder of the effective life of the asset, worked out just before the joining time;

      * (b) the remainder of the effective life, worked out just before the joining time, of each notional asset (which section 4035, 4037, 4040 or 4043 of this Act treats an entity as holding wholly or partly because of expenditure relating to the depreciating asset);

      * (c) any other relevant matters.

    * Subsection 70155(2) of that Act has effect subject to this subsection.

          * Note 1: The effective life of the depreciating asset was set on 1 July 2001 by subsection 4075(4) of this Act, but may have been reset since under Subdivision 40B of the _Income Tax Assessment Act 1997_.

          * Note 2: The effective life of a notional asset is specified by whichever one of sections 4035, 4037, 4040 and 4043 of this Act is relevant to the notional asset.

    * Choosing to reduce tax cost setting amount of asset

    * (8) If:

      * (a) a depreciating asset's tax cost setting amount would be greater than the joining entity's terminating value for the asset; and

      * (b) the head company of the consolidated group chooses to apply this subsection to the asset;

    * the asset's tax cost setting amount is reduced so that it equals the terminating value.

          * Note 1: A consequence of the choice is that subsection (7) applies to the asset.

          * Note 2: The amount of the reduction is not reallocated among other assets.

    * (9) Section 70555 of the _Income Tax Assessment Act 1997_ has effect as if subsection (8) of this section were included in section 70545 of that Act.

          * Note: This affects the order of reductions in the asset's tax cost setting amount under subsection (8) of this section and section 70540 of the _Income Tax Assessment Act 1997_.

##### 705310  Adjustable value of head company's notional assets

    * Application

    * (1) If:

      * (a) section 4035, 4037, 4040 or 4043 of this Act treats the head company of the consolidated group as holding a notional asset at the joining time because expenditure is taken under section 7015 (Entry history rule) of the _Income Tax Assessment Act 1997_ to be expenditure of the head company; and

      * (b) section 4035, 4037, 4040 or 4043 of this Act treated the joining entity as holding a notional asset just before the joining time because of the expenditure;

    * this section affects the adjustable value of the head company's notional asset.

    * Object

    * (2) The object of this section is to ensure, by reducing the adjustable value of a notional asset of the head company, that the head company cannot get both:

      * (a) a deduction for the notional asset reflecting the amount of the expenditure relating to depreciating assets; and

      * (b) a deduction for that amount because of the decline in value of those depreciating assets.

    * Reduction at joining time for expenditure on depreciating assets

    * (3) The opening adjustable value of the head company's notional asset for the income year that includes the joining time is so much of the adjustable value of the joining entity's notional asset just before the joining time as does not reasonably relate to any depreciating asset.

          * Note: This offsets the increases in adjustable value of the head company's depreciating assets under subsection 705305(3).

      * (a) the revocation of the choice mentioned in that subsection takes place before 1 January 2006; and

      * (b) each entity in relation to which the following conditions are satisfied has agreed to the revocation:

        * (i) the entity (the **_leaving entity_**) ceased to be a subsidiary member of the group before the revocation took place;

        * (ii) an asset became that of the leaving entity because section 7011 (the single entity rule) of the _Income Tax Assessment Act 1997_ ceased to apply when the leaving entity ceased to be a subsidiary member;

        * (iii) the asset had become that of the head company because that section applied when the joining entity to which Subdivision 707A of that Act applies (whether or not the same entity as the leaving entity) became a subsidiary member.

##### 707325  Increasing the available fraction for a bundle of losses by increasing the real lossmaker's modified market value

    * Conditions for increasing real lossmaker's modified market value

    * (1) This section affects the working out of the available fraction for a bundle of losses under subsection 707320(1) of the _Income Tax Assessment Act 1997_ if:

      * (a) the transferee mentioned in that subsection chooses under subsection (5) of this section to work out the available fraction using a percentage of the modified market value of a company (the **_value donor_**) other than the real lossmaker mentioned in subsection 707315(1) of that Act for the bundle; and

      * (b) both the real lossmaker and the value donor became members of the group mentioned in subsection 707315(1) of that Act in connection with the bundle at the time (which is the initial transfer time mentioned in that subsection in connection with the bundle) the group became a consolidated group; and

      * (c) the initial transfer time is before 1 July 2004; and

      * (ca) neither the real lossmaker nor the value donor has been, at any time before the initial transfer time, a transitional foreign loss maker prevented by subsection 701D10(1) from being a subsidiary member of a consolidated group; and

      * (d) the bundle includes a loss that is _not_:

        * (i) an overall foreign loss (as defined in former section 160AFD of the _Income Tax Assessment Act 1936_); or

        * (ii) a loss whose utilisation is affected by section 707350 (about utilisation of certain losses originally made for an income year ending on or before 21 September 1999); and

      * (e) the value donor would have been able to transfer the loss to the transferee under Subdivision 707A of the _Income Tax Assessment Act 1997_ at the initial transfer time had the value donor:

        * (i) made the loss for the income year for which the real lossmaker made it; and

        * (ii) not utilised it; and

      * (ea) neither of these sections applies in relation to the value donor as joining entity at the time the group became a consolidated group:

        * (i) section 713535 (Losses of entities whose membership interests are virtual PST assets of life insurance company);

        * (ii) section 713540 (Losses of entities whose membership interests are segregated exempt assets of life insurance company); and

      * (f) the requirement in subsection (2) is met.

    * (2) It must have been possible for the real lossmaker to have transferred the loss to the value donor under Subdivision 170A or 170B of the _Income Tax Assessment Act 1997_ for an income year consisting of the period described in section 707328 had the conditions in that section existed.

    * Adding to the modified market value of the real lossmaker

    * (3) Work out the available fraction for the bundle of losses as if there were added to the modified market value of the real lossmaker at the initial transfer time the amount worked out using the formula:

          * Note: The amount worked out using the formula will be nil if the value donor's modified market value at the initial transfer time is nil. Even if the amount is nil, section 707327 may treat losses transferred by the value donor to the transferee as if they were included in the bundle of losses transferred by the real lossmaker to the transferee.

    * (4) In subsection (3):

    * **_total of real lossmaker's Division 170 losses in bundle_** is the total of the amount of each loss:

      * (a) that is covered by paragraphs (1)(d) and (e); and

      * (b) in relation to which the requirements in subsection (2) are met.

    * **_total of real lossmaker's nonforeign losses in bundle_** is the total of the amount of each loss that is described in paragraph (1)(d).

    * Choice to work out available fraction using this section

    * (5) The transferee may choose to use a fixed percentage (greater than 0% and not more than 100%) of the value donor's modified market value to work out the available fraction for the bundle. The transferee may do so only by the later of:

      * (a) the day on which it lodges its income tax return for the first income year for which it utilises (except in accordance with section 707350) losses transferred to it under Subdivision 707A of the _Income Tax Assessment Act 1997_; and

      * (b) the end of 31 December 2005.

          * Note: For the purposes of paragraph (5)(a), ignore losses to which section 713535 (Losses of entities whose membership interests are virtual PST assets of life insurance companies) of the _Income Tax Assessment Act 1997_ applies. See section 707355 of this Act.

    * (6) The choice cannot be amended, or revoked, after 31 December 2005.

    * If this section applies more than once for the same value donor

    * (7) If subsection (3) applies 2 or more times in relation to the same value donor but different real lossmakers, the transferee cannot choose for those applications percentages of the value donor's modified market value at the initial transfer time that result in the total of the amounts worked out under those applications exceeding that value.

    * Increase in real lossmaker's value reduces value donor's value

    * (8) Work out the available fraction for a bundle of losses transferred under Subdivision 707A of the _Income Tax Assessment Act 1997 from the value donor_ at the initial transfer time as if the value donor's modified market value at the time were reduced by the amount worked out under subsection (3).

    * This section does not affect utilisation of overall foreign losses

    * (9) This section has effect for working out the available fraction of a bundle of losses only so far as it affects the utilisation of a tax loss, film loss or net capital loss. It does not affect the utilisation of an overall foreign loss (as defined in former section 160AFD of the _Income Tax Assessment Act 1936_) included in a bundle of losses:

      * (a) transferred from the real lossmaker under Subdivision 707A of the _Income Tax Assessment Act 1997_; or

      * (b) transferred from the value donor under that Subdivision.

          * Note: If a bundle of losses includes an overall foreign loss and a loss of another sort:

           * (a) utilisation of the overall foreign loss is limited by the available fraction for the bundle worked out apart from this section; and

           * (b) utilisation of the loss of the other sort is limited by the available fraction for the bundle as affected by this section, if applicable.

##### 707326  Events involving only value donor and real lossmaker not covered by rule against inflation of modified market value

    * (1) This section affects the calculation of the modified market value of the real lossmaker mentioned in subsection 707315(1) of the _Income Tax Assessment Act 1997_ for a bundle of losses. This section affects the calculation:

      * (a) only if section 707325 of this Act applies for the purposes of working out the available fraction for the bundle; and

      * (b) only for the purposes of working out the available fraction for the bundle to affect the utilisation of tax losses, film losses and net capital losses in the bundle (and not any overall foreign losses, as defined in former section 160AFD of the _Income Tax Assessment Act 1936_, in the bundle).

          * Note: This section does not affect the calculation of the real lossmaker's modified market value for other purposes (such as the real lossmaker being a value donor for the purposes of another application of section 707325 of this Act).

    * (2) Disregard for the purposes of subsection 707325(2) of the _Income Tax Assessment Act 1997_ an event:

      * (a) that is described in subsection 707325(4) of that Act; and

      * (b) that meets the condition in subsection (3) or (4) of this section.

    * (3) One condition is that the event was an injection of capital directly into the real lossmaker by the value donor mentioned in section 707325 of this Act.

    * (4) The other condition is that the event was a transaction:

      * (a) that did not take place at arm's length; and

      * (b) that involved only the real lossmaker and the value donor mentioned in section 707325 of this Act; and

      * (c) that would have caused subsection 707325(2) of the _Income Tax Assessment Act 1997_ to operate in working out the real lossmaker's modified market value (even if no other events described in subsection 707325(4) of that Act had occurred), apart from this section.

    * (5) Subsection (2) of this section does not apply if subsection 707325(2) of the _Income Tax Assessment Act 1997_:

      * (a) operates for the purposes of working out the value donor's modified market value because of an event that involved an entity other than the value donor and the real lossmaker (whether or not the event also involved either the value donor or the real lossmaker); or

      * (b) would operate for those purposes because of such an event apart from another application of this section.

##### 707327  Choosing available fraction to apply to value donor's loss

    * Conditions for choosing available fraction for value donor's loss

    * (1) This section has effect for the purposes of working out under Subdivision 707C of the _Income Tax Assessment Act 1997_ how much of a tax loss, film loss or net capital loss can be utilised if:

      * (a) the available fraction for a bundle of other losses is worked out, because of section 707325, as if there were added to the modified market value of the real lossmaker of the other losses an amount worked out under that section by reference to the value donor's modified market value; and

      * (b) the loss was transferred under Subdivision 707A of that Act at the initial transfer time _from the value donor_; and

      * (c) the loss is _not_ a loss whose utilisation is affected by section 707350 (about utilisation of certain losses originally made for an income year ending on or before 21 September 1999); and

      * (d) each company covered by subsection (2) would have been able to transfer the loss under Subdivision 707A of that Act at the initial transfer time had the company:

        * (i) made the loss for the income year for which the value donor made it; and

        * (ii) not utilised it; and

      * (e) the requirement in subsection (3) is met.

          * Note: This section has effect even if the amount added to the real lossmaker's modified market value under section 707325 is nil because the value donor's modified market value is nil.

    * (2) This subsection covers:

      * (a) the real lossmaker; and

      * (b) each other company (if any) for which it is the case that the available fraction for the bundle is worked out, because of another application of section 707325, as if there were added to the real lossmaker's modified market value an amount worked out by reference to the company.

    * (3) It must have been possible for the value donor to have transferred an amount (greater than a nil amount) of the loss to each company covered by subsection (2) under Subdivision 170A or 170B of the _Income Tax Assessment Act 1997_ for an income year consisting of the period described in section 707328 had the conditions in that section existed.

    * Treating value donor's loss as included in bundle

    * (4) If the transferee mentioned in subsection 707325(1) chooses, sections 707310, 707335 (except paragraph 707335(2)(a)) and 707340 of the _Income Tax Assessment Act 1997_ (and subsections 707315(3) and (4) of that Act, so far as they relate to those sections) operate as if, at the initial transfer time:

      * (a) the bundle of losses included the loss; and

      * (b) the loss was not included in any other bundle of losses.

          * Note: This section has the effect that the utilisation of the loss will be affected by the available fraction for the bundle of losses.

    * Choice to treat value donor's loss as included in bundle

    * (5) A choice for the purposes of subsection (4):

      * (a) may be made only by the later of:

        * (i) the day on which the transferee lodges its income tax return for the first income year for which it utilises (except in accordance with section 707350) losses transferred to it under Subdivision 707A of the _Income Tax Assessment Act 1997_; and

        * (ii) the end of 31 December 2005; and

      * (b) cannot be revoked after 31 December 2005.

          * Note: For the purposes of subparagraph (5)(a)(i), ignore losses to which section 713535 (Losses of entities whose membership interests are virtual PST assets of life insurance companies) of the _Income Tax Assessment Act 1997_ applies. See section 707355 of this Act.

    * Loss already in bundle with increased available fraction

    * (6) Subsection (4) does not apply in relation to the loss if it was covered by paragraphs 707325(1)(d) and (e) and subsection 707325(2) in an application of section 707325 separate from the application of that section mentioned in paragraph (1)(a) of this section.

          * Note: This means that a loss that provided a basis for section 707325 to apply in relation to the working out of the available fraction for a bundle of losses cannot be treated under this section as if it were included in another bundle of losses.

##### 707328  Income year and conditions for possible transfer under Division 170 of the Income Tax Assessment Act 1997

    * (1) This section sets out the period and conditions referred to:

      * (a) in subsections 707325(2) and 707327(3); and

      * (b) in connection with the requirement that it must have been possible for a company (the **_notional transferor_**) to transfer to another company (the **_notional transferee_**) for an income year a loss under Subdivision 170A or 170B of the _Income Tax Assessment Act 1997_.

    * Period to be treated as income year for transfer

    * (2) The period:

      * (a) starts at the _later_ of these times:

        * (i) the start of the trial year;

        * (ii) the start of the income year for which the loss was made; and

      * (b) ends immediately after the initial transfer time mentioned in subsection 707320(1) of the _Income Tax Assessment Act 1997_.

          * Note: For the purposes of identifying the trial year using the definition in section 707120 of the _Income Tax Assessment Act 1997_, the notional transferor mentioned in this section is the same as the joining entity mentioned in that section, and the initial transfer time mentioned in this section is the same as the joining time mentioned in that section.

    * Conditions

    * (3) The first condition is that neither the notional transferor nor the notional transferee became a subsidiary member of a consolidated group before, at or after the initial transfer time mentioned in the relevant subsection.

    * (4) The second condition is that neither of those Subdivisions had been amended to provide only for transfers involving an Australian branch (as defined in section 160ZZV of the _Income Tax Assessment Act 1936_) of a foreign bank.

    * (5) The third condition is that the notional transferee's income or gains for the income year were great enough not to prevent the transfer.

    * (6) The fourth condition is that those Subdivisions operated as if the notional transferor had made the loss for the income year if the notional transferor had actually made it for an income year ending just before the initial transfer time.

##### 707328A  Some events involving only group members not covered by rule against inflation of modified market value

    * Overview

    * (1) Subsection (3) of this section affects the calculation, under section 707325 of the _Income Tax Assessment Act 1997_ and section 707325 of this Act, of the modified market value of the real lossmaker mentioned in subsection 707315(1) of that Act for a bundle of losses, but only if:

      * (a) the requirement in subsection (2) of this section is met in relation to each other company that became a member of the group mentioned in subsection 707315(1) of that Act in connection with the bundle at the time (the **_formation time_**) the group became a consolidated group; and

      * (b) the provisions described in subsection 707327(4) of this Act operate (because of that subsection) in relation to each loss of such a company that is covered by paragraphs 707327(1)(b) and (c) of this Act as if the bundle included the loss; and

      * (c) all members of the group at the formation time were companies; and

      * (d) subsection 707325(2) of that Act does not operate, for the purposes of working out the modified market value of an entity that became a member of the group at the formation time, because of an event that involved an entity that did not become a member of the group then; and

      * (e) the transferee mentioned in subsection 707325(1) of this Act chooses that this section apply in relation to the real lossmaker.

    * (2) Section 707325 of this Act must apply in relation to the other company (as value donor) so that the available fraction for the bundle is to be worked out as if there were added to the real lossmaker's modified market value an amount worked out by reference to the other company's modified market value at the initial transfer time.

    * Disregarding events for purposes of antiinflation rule

    * (3) Disregard for the purposes of subsection 707325(2) of the _Income Tax Assessment Act 1997_ an event that is described in subsection 707325(4) of that Act and was either:

      * (a) an injection of capital into an entity that became a member of the group at the formation time by another such entity; or

      * (b) a transaction that involved only entities that became members of the group at the formation time.

          * Note: Disregarding such an event could have a direct or indirect effect on the real lossmaker's modified market value for the purposes of working out the available fraction for the bundle in one of these ways:

           * (a) it could directly affect the real lossmaker's modified market value calculated under section 707325 of the _Income Tax Assessment Act 1997_, if the real lossmaker was involved in the event;

           * (b) it could have an indirect effect by affecting the value donor's modified market value calculated under that section and used under section 707325 of this Act to add an amount to the real lossmaker's modified market value for those purposes.

    * Choice

    * (4) A choice for the purposes of paragraph (1)(e):

      * (a) may be made only by the later of:

        * (i) the day on which the transferee lodges its income tax return for the first income year for which it utilises (except in accordance with section 707350) losses transferred to it under Subdivision 707A of the _Income Tax Assessment Act 1997_; and

        * (ii) the end of 31 December 2005; and

      * (b) cannot be amended, or revoked, after 31 December 2005.

          * Note: For the purposes of subparagraph (4)(a)(i), ignore losses to which section 713535 (Losses of entities whose membership interests are virtual PST assets of life insurance companies) of the _Income Tax Assessment Act 1997_ applies. See section 707355 of this Act.

    * Scope of this section

    * (5) This section affects the modified market value of an entity that became a member of the group at the formation time only for the purposes of calculating the real lossmaker's modified market value for the purposes of working out the available fraction for the bundle.

    * (6) This section has effect for working out the available fraction of the bundle only so far as it affects the utilisation of a tax loss, film loss or net capital loss. It does not affect the utilisation of an overall foreign loss (as defined in former section 160AFD of the _Income Tax Assessment Act 1936_) that:

      * (a) is included in the bundle; or

      * (b) was transferred under Subdivision 707A of the _Income Tax Assessment Act 1997_ from an entity other than the real lossmaker.

          * Note: If the bundle includes an overall foreign loss and a loss of another sort:

           * (a) utilisation of the overall foreign loss is limited by the available fraction for the bundle worked out apart from this section; and

           * (b) utilisation of the loss of the other sort is limited by the available fraction for the bundle as affected by this section, if applicable.

    * (7) This section can operate in relation to only one bundle of losses transferred to the transferee under Subdivision 707A of the _Income Tax Assessment Act 1997._

##### _707329  Modified market value at a time before 8 December 2004

    * Disregard an event that is described in subsection 707325(4) of the _Income Tax Assessment Act 1997_ and occurred on or before 8 December 2000 in working out under section 707325 of that Act the modified market value of an entity at the time it becomes a member of a consolidated group on a day before 8 December 2004.

##### 707350  Alternative loss utilisation regime to Subdivision 707C of the Income Tax Assessment Act 1997

    * (1) This section affects the way in which one or more losses of one particular sort in a bundle of losses transferred under Subdivision 707A of the _Income Tax Assessment Act 1997_ before 1 July 2004 can be utilised by the transferee if:

      * (a) they were actually made (disregarding that Subdivision) by a company (the **_real lossmaker_**) for an income year ending on or before 21 September 1999; and

      * (b) they were transferred at the time (the **_initial transfer time_**) the transferee became the head company of a consolidated group; and

      * (c) they were transferred to the transferee from the real lossmaker because:

        * (i) the real lossmaker met the conditions in section 16512 of that Act; and

        * (ii) the conditions in one or more of paragraph6515(1)(a), (b) and (c) did not exist in relation to the real lossmaker; and

      * (d) none of them had been transferred under that Subdivision before the initial transfer time; and

      * (da) the real lossmaker has not been, at any time before the initial transfer time, a transitional foreign loss maker prevented by subsection 701D10(1) from being a subsidiary member of a consolidated group; and

      * (e) the transferee has made a choice under subsection (5).

    * Losses to be utilised only after nontransferred losses

    * (2) The transferee may utilise for an income year the losses only _after_ utilising for the year losses (the **_nontransferred losses_**) of the same sort that the transferee made without a transfer under Subdivision 707A of the _Income Tax Assessment Act 1997_ (even if the income year for which the transferee made the losses is earlier than an income year for which the transferee made any of the nontransferred losses).

    * Further limit on utilising the losses

    * (3) The amount of the losses that the transferee may utilise for an income year _cannot exceed_ the amount worked out for the year using the table.

    * Subdivision 707C of Income Tax Assessment Act 1997 disapplied

    * (4) Subdivision 707C of the _Income Tax Assessment Act 1997_ operates as if the losses had been made by the transferee _without_ being transferred under Subdivision 707A of that Act.

          * Note: This has 2 effects. First, Subdivision 707C of that Act does not limit utilisation of the losses. Secondly, it affects the limit that Subdivision sets on utilising other losses in any bundle (because that limit depends on the transferee's income and gains remaining after utilisation of losses that have not been transferred under Subdivision 707A of that Act).

    * Making choice

    * (5) The transferee may choose that this section apply to the utilisation for any income year of all losses (of any sort) in the bundle that meet the conditions in paragraphs (1)(a), (b), (c) and (d). The transferee may do so only by the later of:

      * (a) the day on which it lodges its income tax return for the first income year for which it could utilise any losses transferred to it under Subdivision 707A of the _Income Tax Assessment Act 1997_ (as described in subsection (1) or otherwise); and

      * (b) the end of 31 December 2005.

          * Note: For the purposes of paragraph (5)(a), ignore losses to which section 713535 (Losses of entities whose membership interests are virtual PST assets of life insurance companies) of the _Income Tax Assessment Act 1997_ applies. See section 707355 of this Act.

    * When choice has effect

    * (6) The choice has effect for that income year and all later income years (and cannot be revoked after 31 December 2005).

    * Future transfer of the losses not affected

    * (7) This section does not limit the transfer under Subdivision 707A of the _Income Tax Assessment Act 1997_ of any of the losses from the transferee to another company.

##### 707355  Ignore certain losses in working out when a choice can be made under this Subdivision

    * In working out when a choice may be made under subsection 707325(5), 707327(5), 707328A(4) or 707350(5), ignore losses to which section 713535 of the _Income Tax Assessment Act 1997_ applies.

          * Note: That section deals with losses transferred under Subdivision 707A of that Act from certain whollyowned subsidiaries of life insurance companies that are members of a consolidated group.

##### 712305  Reducing adjustable value of head company's notional asset

    * (1) This section reduces the adjustable value of a notional asset that section 4035, 4037, 4038, 4040 or 4043 treats the head company of a consolidated group as holding, if:

      * (a) an entity (the **_leaving entity_**) ceases to be a subsidiary member of the group at a time (the **_leaving time_**); and

      * (b) that section treats the leaving entity as holding a notional asset because of section 70140 (Exit history rule) of the _Income Tax Assessment Act 1997_.

          * Note: Section 70140 (Exit history rule) of the _Income Tax Assessment Act 1997_ treats as expenditure of the leaving entity certain expenditure incurred before the leaving time in relation to an asset or business that was an asset or business of the leaving entity at the leaving time.

    * (2) The adjustable value of the head company's notional asset is reduced at the leaving time by the adjustable value of the leaving entity's notional asset at that time.

       * 713545	Discount capital gain in certain cases

##### 713500  Object of Subdivision

    * The object of this Subdivision is to give an opportunity to a group of entities that includes a life insurance company to rearrange the assets of the group for the purposes of one or more of them becoming members of a consolidated group in a way that does not attract any immediate taxation consequences.

##### 713505  When this Subdivision applies (first case)

    * (1) This Subdivision provides for a deferral of the taxation consequences that would occur because of an event (the **_deferral event_**) happening involving an entity (the **_originating entity_**) and another entity (the **_recipient entity_**) if:

      * (a) the event occurs in connection with a life insurance company (the **_member life insurance company_**) becoming a member of a consolidated group; and

      * (b) the relevant conditions in section 713520 are met.

    * (2) If the originating entity is a company, the deferral event referred to in subsection (1) is a CGT event referred to in subsection (4) happening to a CGT asset (the **_original asset_**) where, apart from this Subdivision, the happening of the event would have resulted in:

      * (a) an amount (other than a capital gain) being included in the originating entity's assessable income; or

      * (b) the originating entity making a capital gain.

    * (3) If the originating entity is a trust, the deferral event referred to in subsection (1) is a CGT event referred to in subsection (4) happening to a CGT asset (also the **_original asset_**) where, apart from this Subdivision, the happening of the event would have resulted in:

      * (a) an amount (other than a capital gain) being included in the net income of the trust; or

      * (b) the trustee making a capital gain.

    * (4) The CGT events are:

      * (a) CGT events A1, B1, D1, D2, D3, E2, F1 and F2; and

      * (b) CGT event C2, but only if the CGT asset that ends is a unit in a unit trust that is replaced by an equivalent membership interest (the **_replacement interest_**) in a company or in another trust.

##### 713510  When this Subdivision applies (second case)

    * (1) This Subdivision also provides for a deferral of the taxation consequences that would occur if:

      * (a) a life insurance company transfers an asset (also the **_original asset_**) to its virtual PST or from its virtual PST where, apart from this Subdivision, section 320200 of the _Income Tax Assessment Act 1997_ would apply to the transfer; or

      * (b) a life insurance company transfers an asset (also the **_original asset_**) to its segregated exempt assets where, apart from this Subdivision, section 320255 of the _Income Tax Assessment Act 1997_ would apply to the transfer;

    * where the transfer (also the **_deferral event_**) is made in connection with the life insurance company (also the **_member life insurance company_**) becoming a member of a consolidated group.

    * (2) The relevant conditions in section 713520 must be met.

##### 713515  Entities must choose the relief

    * (1) This Subdivision applies only if the originating entity (for a section 713505 case) or the life insurance company (for a section 713510 case) chooses that it apply.

    * (2) The choice must be made:

      * (a) by the day the originating entity or the life insurance company, or the head company of the consolidated group of which it is a member, lodges its income tax return for the income year in which the deferral event happened; or

      * (b) within a further time allowed by the Commissioner.

##### 713520  Conditions

    * (1) For a section 713505 case:

      * (a) the originating entity must be:

        * (i) a life insurance company that has virtual PST assets or segregated exempt assets and that is a member of a consolidatable group; or

        * (ii) an entity that is unable to be a member of the same consolidatable group as a life insurance company because of section 713510 of the _Income Tax Assessment Act 1997_; or

        * (iii) an entity that is, directly or indirectly, a subsidiary of a life insurance company and is a member of the same consolidated group as the life insurance company; and

      * (b) the originating entity and the recipient entity must be members of the same consolidatable group or consolidated group or, if they are not, they would have been apart from section 713510 of the _Income Tax Assessment Act 1997_; and

      * (c) any asset transferred by the originating entity must be transferred to the recipient entity at its transfer value.

    * (2) For both a section 713505 case and a section 713510 case:

      * (a) the total transfer values of the virtual PST assets of the member life insurance company just before a transfer of assets to which this Subdivision applies must be the same as the total transfer values of those assets just after the transfer; and

      * (b) the total transfer values of the segregated exempt assets of the member life insurance company just before a transfer of assets to which this Subdivision applies must be the same as the total transfer values of those assets just after the transfer.

    * (3) Any transfer of an asset under the deferral event must happen on or before the later of:

      * (a) 30 June 2004; and

      * (b) if the head company of the consolidated group of which the member life insurance company is a member has a substituted accounting period--the end of the head company's income year in which 30 June 2004 occurs.

##### 713525  Time of transfer

    * This Act, and the _Income Tax Assessment Act 1997_, apply to the transfer of an asset to which this Subdivision applies as if the asset had been transferred just before the member life insurance company became a member of the consolidated group.

##### 713530  What the relief is

    * (1) For a section 713505 case:

      * (a) if the originating entity is a company:

        * (i) any amount (other than a capital gain) that would have been included in the originating entity's assessable income (the **_deferred amount_**) as a result of the deferral event is not so included; and

        * (ii) any capital gain (the **_deferred gain_**) that the originating entity would have made as a result of the deferral event is disregarded; and

      * (b) if the originating entity is a trust:

        * (i) any amount (other than a capital gain) that would have been included in the member life insurance company's assessable income (also the **_deferred amount_**) as a result of the deferral event is not so included; and

        * (ii) any capital gain (also the **_deferred gain_**) that the member life insurance company would have made as a result of the deferral event is disregarded.

    * (2) For a section 713510 case:

      * (a) any amount that would have been included in the member life insurance company's assessable income (also the **_deferred amount_**) under paragraph 32015(e) or (g) of the _Income Tax Assessment Act 1997_ as a result of the deferral event is not so included; and

      * (b) any capital gain (also the **_deferred gain_**) that the member life insurance company would have made as a result of the deferral event is disregarded.

##### 713535  Subsequent consequences

    * (1) This section operates if, after the deferral event happens, another event (the **_new event_**) happens where the new event is:

      * (a) a CGT event happening to:

        * (i) the original asset; or

        * (ii) if the deferral event was CGT event C2--the replacement asset; or

      * (b) the recipient entity ceasing to be a member of the consolidated group of which the member life insurance company is a member; or

      * (c) if the recipient entity is a life insurance company:

        * (i) the original asset being transferred to or from the company's virtual PST under section 320180, 320185 or 320195 of the _Income Tax Assessment Act 1997_; or

        * (ii) the original asset being transferred to or from the company's segregated exempt assets under section 320235, 320240 or 320250 of that Act; or

      * (d) if the originating entity is a company--the originating entity ceasing to exist.

    * (2) For a section 713505 case where the originating entity is a company:

      * (a) the originating entity must include the deferred amount in its assessable income for the income year in which the new event happens; or

      * (b) the originating entity is taken, just before the new event happened, to have made a capital gain equal to the deferred gain.

          * Note: If the originating entity is a subsidiary member of a consolidated group, the head company of the group will have the amount included in its assessable income or will make the capital gain.

    * (3) For a section 713505 case where the originating entity is a trust:

      * (a) the member life insurance company must include the deferred amount in its assessable income for the income year in which the new event happens; or

      * (b) the member life insurance company is taken, just before the new event happened, to have made a capital gain equal to the deferred gain.

    * (4) For a section 713505 case where the originating entity is a life insurance company or a trust and the deferred amount or the deferred gain relates to an asset that was a virtual PST asset at the time when the deferral event happened, an amount equal to the deferred amount or deferred gain is taken to be an amount of assessable income to which subsection 320205(3) of the _Income Tax Assessment Act 1997_ applies for the relevant entity.

    * (5) For a section 713510 case:

      * (a) the member life insurance company must include the deferred amount in its assessable income for the income year in which the new event happens; or

      * (b) the member life insurance company is taken, just before the new event happened, to have made a capital gain equal to the deferred gain.

    * (6) In addition, if the deferral event involved the transfer of assets from the member life insurance company's virtual PST, an amount equal to the deferred amount or deferred gain is taken to be an amount of assessable income to which subsection 320205(3) of the _Income Tax Assessment Act 1997_ applies for the relevant entity.

##### 713540  Requirement to notify happening of new event

    * (1) For a section 713505 case, the recipient entity must, if it is not a member of the same consolidated group as the originating entity when the new event happens, notify the originating entity in the approved form of the happening of the new event within 60 days after the new event happens.

    * (2) Subsection (1) does not apply if the new event is the originating entity ceasing to exist.

##### 713545  Discount capital gain in certain cases

    * The _Income Tax Assessment Act 1997_ applies as if the capital gain referred to in paragraph 713535(2)(b), (3)(b) or (5)(b) were a discount capital gain if:

      * (a) the asset to which the deferral event happened is a virtual PST asset; and

      * (b) the asset was acquired less than 12 months before the deferral event happened; and

      * (c) the new event happens at least 12 months after the asset was acquired.

      * (b) but for the cessation of membership and section 70140 of the _Income Tax Assessment Act 1997_ (the exit history rule), the head company of the group would be subject to a balancing adjustment under item 104 of Schedule 1 to the _Tax Laws Amendment (Taxation of Financial Arrangements) Act 2009 _for an income year ending after the leaving time.

    * (2) Despite section 70140 of the _Income Tax Assessment Act 1997_ (the exit history rule), the head company of the consolidated group continues to be subject to the balancing adjustment for income years ending after the leaving time.

      * (a) disregard a capital gain of the IMR foreign fund to the extent that the capital gain is a pre2012 IMR capital gain; and

      * (b) disregard a pre2012 IMR capital loss of the IMR foreign fund for the purposes of determining the amount of the capital gain remaining after applying steps 1 to 4 of the method statement in subsection 1025(1); and

      * (c) disregard a net capital loss of the IMR foreign fund to the extent that it is attributable to a pre2012 IMR capital loss for the purposes of determining how much of a capital gain that is not a pre2012 IMR capital gain remains after applying steps 1 to 4 of the method statement in subsection 1025(1).

          * Note: The effect of this subsection is that the increase to the assessable amount which occurs as a result of section 115220 of the _Income Tax Assessment Act 1997_ is calculated with reference to the capital gains of the IMR foreign fund that are not IMR capital gains or amounts referable to IMR capital gains (rather than by calculating the increase with reference to _all_ capital gains of the fund).

    * Modifications to section 115225 of the Income Tax Assessment Act 1997

    * (4) For the purposes of applying section 115225 of the _Income Tax Assessment Act 1997 _in respect of section 115220, make the following assumptions:

      * (a) replace the references in section 115225 to the net income of the trust estate with references to the pre2012 nonIMR net income (within the meaning of subsection 842240(1) of the _Income Tax (Transitional Provisions) Act 1997_) of the trust estate;

      * (b) replace the references in section 115225 to net capital gain (if any) with a reference to pre2012 nonIMR net capital gain (if any) (within the meaning of subsection 842240(3) of the _Income Tax (Transitional Provisions) Act 1997_).

    * Modifications to section 98 of the Income Tax Assessment Act 1936

    * (5) For the purposes of applying section 98 of the _Income Tax Assessment Act 1936_ in respect of an income year that is the 201011 income year or an earlier income year, replace references in that section to net income with references to pre2012 nonIMR net income (within the meaning of subsection 842240(1) of the _Income Tax (Transitional Provisions) Act 1997_).

          * Note: The effect of this subsection is that where section 98 of the _Income Tax Assessment Act 1936 _applies to the trustee of a trust that is an IMR foreign fund, the trustee is only assessed and made liable to pay tax in respect of pre2012 nonIMR net income of the fund (rather than in respect of _all_ net income of the fund to which section 98 would otherwise apply).

    * Modifications to section 99E of the Income Tax Assessment Act 1936

    * (6) For the purposes of applying section 99E of the _Income Tax Assessment Act 1936_ in respect of an income year that is the 201011 income year or an earlier income year:

      * (a) replace the reference to so much of the net income with a reference to so much of the net income or pre2012 nonIMR net income (within the meaning of subsection 842240(1) of the _Income Tax (Transitional Provisions) Act 1997_) as the case may be; and

      * (b) replace the reference to a part of the net income of another trust estate with a reference to a part of the pre2012 nonIMR net income (within the meaning of subsection 842240(1) of the _Income Tax (Transitional Provisions) Act 1997_) of another trust estate.

          * Note: The effect of this subsection is that the trustee of a trust that receives a distribution of pre2012 nonIMR net income from another trust is not required to apply section 98, 99 or 99A of the _Income Tax Assessment Act 1936_ to those amounts.

    * Certain losses disregarded

    * (7) The IMR foreign fund cannot utilise a tax loss or net capital loss in relation to the income year, or in any future income year, to the extent the loss is attributable to pre2012 IMR income, a pre2012 IMR capital gain, a pre2012 IMR deduction or a pre2012 IMR capital loss.

##### 842230  Pre2012 IMR deduction

    * (1) The **_pre2012 IMR deduction _**of an IMR foreign fund for an income year is the amount of the fund's deductions for the income year to the extent to which they:

      * (a) are attributable to gaining the fund's pre2012 IMR income; and

      * (b) relate to the 201112 income year, or an earlier income year.

    * (2) Disregard the following provisions for the purposes of determining the pre2012 IMR deduction of the fund:

      * (a) subsection 842210(3) (which is about certain amounts of an IMR foreign fund being disregarded);

      * (b) paragraph 842240(1)(b) (which is about pre2012 nonIMR net income);

      * (c) paragraph 842245(a) (which is about pre2012 nonIMR partnership net income).

##### 842235  Pre2012 IMR capital loss

    * The **_pre2012 IMR capital loss _**of an IMR foreign fund for an income year is the sum of the fund's capital losses made in the income year that are attributable to CGT assets that are financial arrangements covered by section 842245 of the _Income Tax Assessment Act 1997_.

##### 842240  Pre2012 nonIMR net income, pre2012 nonIMR Division 6E net income and pre2012 nonIMR net capital gain

    * (1) A trust's **_pre2012 nonIMR net income _**in relation to an income year is determined by calculating the net income of the trust as follows:

      * (a) for income years prior to the 201011 income year--disregard the pre2012 IMR capital gain and pre2012 IMR capital loss;

      * (b) disregard the pre2012 IMR income and pre2012 IMR deduction of the trust for the income year;

      * (c) disregard any amount that is included in the trust's assessable income under subsection 20735(1) to the extent that the amount is attributable to pre2012 IMR income of the trust for the income year;

      * (d) if the trust is a beneficiary of another trust--then:

        * (i) for the purposes of applying Division 6 of Part III of the _Income Tax Assessment Act 1936_ to the trust that is a beneficiary, replace the references in that Division to share of the net income with references to share of the pre2012 nonIMR net income (within the meaning of subsection 842240(1) of the _Income Tax (Transitional Provisions) Act 1997_); and

        * (ii) for the purposes of applying Division 6E of Part III of the _Income Tax Assessment Act 1936_ to the trust that is a beneficiary, replace references in that Division to Division 6E net income with references to pre2012 nonIMR Division 6E net income (within the meaning of subsection 842240(1) of the _Income Tax (Transitional Provisions) Act 1997_);

      * (e) if the trust is a partner in a partnership--for the purposes of applying Division 5 of Part III of the _Income Tax Assessment Act 1936 _to the partner, replace the references to the individual interest of the partner in the partnership net income or partnership loss with references to the individual interest of the partner in the pre2012 nonIMR partnership net income or pre2012 nonIMR partnership loss (within the meaning of subsection 842240(1) of the _Income Tax (Transitional Provisions) Act 1997_).

          *  	Note: The net income of a trust may include a share of the net income of another trust. Where there is a chain of trusts, these calculations are applied to each trust in the chain.

    * Pre2012 nonIMR Division 6E net income

    * (2) A trust's **_pre2012 nonIMR Division 6E net income _**in relation to an income year is determined by calculating the Division 6E net income (within the meaning of subsection 102UY(3) of the _Income Tax Assessment Act 1936_) of the trust as follows:

      * (a) disregard the pre2012 IMR income and pre2012 IMR deduction of the trust in relation to the income year;

      * (b) disregard the things mentioned in subparagraphs 102UW(b)(i) to (iii) of the _Income Tax Assessment Act 1936_ (which is about adjustments of Division 6 assessable amounts) in relation to the income year.

    * Pre2012 nonIMR net capital gain

    * (3) A trust's **_pre2012 nonIMR net capital gain _**in relation to an income year is determined by calculating the net capital gain of the trust as follows:

      * (a) disregard the trust's pre2012 IMR capital gain and pre2012 IMR capital loss in relation to the income year;

      * (b) disregard any capital gain of the trust in relation to the income year that is referable to a pre2012 IMR capital gain of another IMR foreign fund that is a trust.

    * A partnership's **_pre2012 nonIMR partnership net income _**or **_pre2012 nonIMR partnership loss _**in relation to an income year is determined by calculating the net income or partnership loss of the partnership as follows:

      * (a) disregard the pre2012 IMR income and pre2012 IMR deduction of the partnership for the income year;

      * (b) disregard any amount included in the partnership's assessable income under subsection 20735(1) to the extent that the amount is attributable to pre2012 IMR income of the partnership for the income year;

      * (c) if the partnership is a beneficiary of a trust--then:

        * (i) for the purposes of applying Division 6 of Part III of the _Income Tax Assessment Act 1936_ to the beneficiary, replace the references in that Division to share of the net income with references to share of the pre2012 nonIMR net income (within the meaning of subsection 842240(1) of the _Income Tax (Transitional Provisions) Act 1997_); and
