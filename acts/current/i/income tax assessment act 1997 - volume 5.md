## Chapter 3--Specialist liability rules

### Part 35--Corporate taxpayers and corporate distributions

#### Division 164--Nonshare capital accounts for companies

##### Guide to Division 164

##### 1641  What this Division is about

    * A company that issues nonshare equity interests will have a notional account called a **_nonshare capital account_**. This account records contributions to the company in relation to those nonshare equity interests and returns made by the company of those contributions.

    * A nonshare distribution that represents a return of contributions is not taxed as a dividend (subject to the antiavoidance provisions dealing with dividend substitution). In certain circumstances a company may use its share capital account as the source for such distributions.

##### Table of sections

  * Operative provisions

      * 1645	Object

      * 16410	Nonshare capital account

      * 16415	Credits to nonshare capital account

      * 16420	Debits to nonshare capital account

##### Operative provisions

##### 1645  Object

    * (1) This Division provides for the *nonshare capital account through which a company records contributions made to it in respect of *nonshare equity interests and returns by it of those contributions.

    * (2) This allows a *nonshare distribution to be characterised as either:

     * (a) a *nonshare dividend; or

     * (b) a *nonshare capital return.

##### 16410  Nonshare capital account

    * (1) A company has a **_nonshare capital account_** if:

     * (a) the company issues a *nonshare equity interest in the company on or after 1 July 2001; or

     * (b) the company has issued a nonshare equity interest in the company before 1 July 2001 that is still in existence on 1 July 2001; or

     * (c) a *debt interest in the company changes at a particular time (the **_change time_**) to an *equity interest in the company because of subsection 974110(1) or (2); or

     * (d) the following conditions are satisfied in relation to an interest in the company:

       * (i) immediately before subsection 97475(4) ceases to have effect, the interest is taken to be a debt interest in the company because of that subsection;

       * (ii) the interest is an equity interest in the company at the time (the **_change time_**) that is immediately after that cessation;

       * (iii) subsection 97475(6) does not apply to the interest in relation to the income year that includes the change time; or

     * (e) the following conditions are satisfied in relation to an interest in the company:

       * (i) subsection 97475(6) applies to the interest in relation to a particular income year;

       * (ii) that subsection does not apply to the interest in relation to the next income year;

       * (iii) the interest is an equity interest in the company at the time (the **_change time_**) that is the start of that next income year.

    * (2) The account continues in existence even if the company ceases to have any *nonshare equity interests on issue.

    * (3) The balance of the account cannot fall below nil.

    * (4) The only credits and debits that may be made to the account are those provided for in sections 16415 and 16420.

##### 16415  Credits to nonshare capital account

    * (1) If the company issues a *nonshare equity interest in the company on or after 1 July 2001, there is a credit to the *nonshare capital account equal to:

    * where: 

    * **_amount received_** is the *market value, when it is provided, of the consideration the company receives for the issue of the interest.

    * **_share capital account credit_** is the amount of any credit made to the company's *share capital account in respect of the issue of the interest.

         * Note: The issue of a nonshare equity interest can give rise to a credit to the company's share capital account if the interest consists, for example, of a stapled security that includes a share in the company's capital.

    * (2) If paragraph 16410(1)(c), (d) or (e) applies in relation to a particular interest in the company, there is a credit to the *nonshare capital account at the change time referred to in that paragraph of an amount equal to:

    * where: 

    * **_amount received_** is the *market value, when it was provided, of the consideration the company received for the issue of the interest.

    * **_amount returned_** is so much of the amount received as has been returned to a holder of the interest before the change time.

    * **_share capital account credit_** is the amount of any credit made to the company's *share capital account in respect of the issue of the interest.

    * (3) If the company has a *nonshare capital account at the beginning of 1 July 2001 because of a *nonshare equity interest the company issued before 1 July 2001, there is a credit to the nonshare capital account on that day for each nonshare equity interest in the company that:

     * (a) was issued before 1 July 2001; and

     * (b) is still in existence on 1 July 2001_._

    * _	(4)	The amount of the credit under subsection (3) is:

    * where: 

    * **_amount received_** is the *market value, when it is provided, of the consideration the company receives for the issue of the interest.

    * **_return of amount received_** is the sum of the amounts paid before 1 July 2001 by way of return, in whole or in part, of the amount received.

    * **_share capital account credit_** is the sum of any amounts credited before 1 July 2001 to the company's *share capital account in respect of the issue of the interest.

    * (5) To avoid doubt, if:

     * (a) it appears that a credit to the company's *nonshare capital account has arisen under this section because an interest in the company appears to be, or have become, an *equity interest at a time in a particular income year; and

     * (b) because subsection 97475(6) or 974110(1A) is subsequently found to apply in relation to the interest and that income year, the interest was not in fact, or did not in fact become, an equity interest at that time;

    * the credit referred to in paragraph (a) is taken never to have arisen.

##### 16420  Debits to nonshare capital account

    * (1) The company may debit the whole or a part of a *nonshare distribution against the company's *nonshare capital account:

     * (a) to the extent to which the distribution is made as consideration for the surrender, cancellation or redemption of a *nonshare equity interest in the company; or

     * (b) to the extent to which:

       * (i) the distribution is made in connection with a reduction in the *market value of a nonshare equity interest in the company; and

       * (ii) the amount of the distribution is equal to the amount of the reduction in market value.

    * (2) The total of the amounts debited to the account in respect of a particular *nonshare equity interest must not exceed the total of the amounts credited to the account in respect of the interest.

    * (3) If:

     * (a) an *equity interest in the company changes at a particular time (the **_change time_**) to a *debt interest in the company because of subsection 974110(1) or (2); or

     * (b) an equity interest in the company changes to a debt interest in the company, with effect from a time (the **_change time_**) that is the start of a particular income year, because of subsection 974110(1A); or

     * (c) the following conditions are satisfied in relation to an interest in the company:

       * (i) subsection 97475(6) does not apply to the interest in relation to a particular income year;

       * (ii) the interest is an equity interest in the company at the end of that income year;

       * (iii) subsection 97475(6) applies to the interest from the time (the **_change time_**) that is the start of the next income year;

    * there is, or is taken to have been, a debit to the *nonshare capital account at the change time equal to:

    * where: 

    * **_credits in relation to the interest_** is the sum of all the credits that have been made to the *nonshare capital account in relation to the interest before the change time.

    * **_debits in relation to the interest_** is the sum of all the debits that have been made to the *nonshare capital account in relation to the interest before the change time.

    * (4) To avoid doubt, if:

     * (a) it appears that a debit to the company's *nonshare capital account has arisen because an interest in the company appears to be, or have become, a *debt interest at a time in a particular income year; and

     * (b) because subsection 97475(6) or 974110(1A) is subsequently found not to apply in relation to the interest and that income year, the interest was not in fact, or did not in fact become, a debt interest at that time;

    * the debit referred to in paragraph (a) is taken never to have arisen.

    * A company cannot deduct a tax loss unless: 

         * (a) it has the same owners and the same control throughout the period from the start of the loss year to the end of the income year; or

         * (b) it satisfies the same business test by carrying on the same business, entering into no new kinds of transactions and conducting no new kinds of business.

            * Note: The exceptions mentioned in this section apply differently in relation to designated infrastructure project entities: see section 41535.

##### Operative provisions

##### 16510  To deduct a tax loss

    * A company cannot deduct a *tax loss unless either:

     * (a) it meets the conditions in section 16512 (which is about the company maintaining the same owners); or

          * Note: See section 165215 for a special alternative to these conditions.

     * (b) it meets the condition in section 16513 (which is about the company satisfying the same business test).

         * Note: In the case of a widely held or eligible Division 166 company, Subdivision 166A modifies how this Subdivision applies, unless the company chooses otherwise.

##### 16512  Company must maintain the same owners

    * Ownership test period

    * (1) In determining whether section 16510 prevents a company from deducting a *tax loss, the **_ownership test period_** is the period from the start of the *loss year to the end of the income year.

         * Note: See section 165255 for the rule about incomplete test periods.

    * Voting power

    * (2) There must be persons who had *more than 50% of the voting power in the company at all times during the *ownership test period.

         * Note: See section 165150 to work out who had more than 50% of the voting power.

    * Rights to dividends

    * (3) There must be persons who had rights to *more than 50% of the company's dividends at all times during the *ownership test period.

         * Note: See section 165155 to work out who had rights to more than 50% of the company's dividends.

    * Rights to capital distributions

    * (4) There must be persons who had rights to *more than 50% of the company's capital distributions at all times during the *ownership test period.

         * Note: See section 165160 to work out who had rights to more than 50% of the company's capital distributions.

    * When to apply the primary test

    * (5) To work out whether a condition in this section was satisfied at all times during the *ownership test period, apply the primary test for that condition unless subsection (6) requires the alternative test to be applied.

         * Note: For the primary test, see subsections 165150(1), 165155(1) and 165160(1).

    * When to apply the alternative test

    * (6) Apply the alternative test for that condition if one or more other companies beneficially owned *shares or interests in shares in the company at any time during the *ownership test period.

         * Note: For the alternative test, see subsections 165150(2), 165155(2) and 165160(2).

    * Conditions in subsections (2), (3) and (4) may be treated as having been satisfied in certain circumstances

    * (7) If any of the conditions in subsections (2), (3) and (4) have not been satisfied, those conditions are taken to have been satisfied if:

     * (a) they would have been satisfied except for the operation of section 165165; and

     * (b) the company has information from which it would be reasonable to conclude that less than 50% of the *tax loss has been reflected in deductions, capital losses, or reduced assessable income, that occurred, or could occur in future, because of the happening of any *CGT event in relation to any *direct equity interests or *indirect equity interests in the company during the *ownership test period.

    * (7A) If the company is:

     * (a) a *nonprofit company; or

     * (b) a *mutual affiliate company; or

     * (c) a *mutual insurance company;

    * during the whole of the *ownership test period, the conditions in subsections (3) and (4) are taken to have been satisfied by the company.

    * Time of happening of CGT event

    * (8) The happening of a *CGT event in relation to a *direct equity interest or *indirect equity interest in the company that results in the failure of the company to satisfy a condition in subsection (2), (3) or (4) is taken, for the purposes of paragraph (7)(b), to have occurred during the *ownership test period.

##### 16513  Alternatively, the company must satisfy the same business test

    * (1) This section sets out the condition that a company must meet to be able to deduct the *tax loss if:

     * (a) the company fails to meet a condition in subsection 16512(2), (3) or (4); or

     * (b) it is not practicable to show that the company meets the conditions in those subsections.

         * Note	Other provisions may treat the company as meeting, or failing to meet, the conditions in subsections 16512(2), (3) and (4).

    * (2) The company must satisfy the *same business test for the income year (the **_same business test period_**). Apply the test to the *business the company carried on immediately before the time (the **_test time_**) shown in the relevant item of the table.

         *  For the same business test: see Subdivision 165E.

##### 16515  The same people must control the voting power, or the company must satisfy the same business test

    * (1) Even if a company meets the conditions in section 16512 or 16513, it cannot deduct the *tax loss if:

     * (a) for some or all of the part of the *ownership test period that started at the end of the *loss year, a person controlled, or was able to control, the voting power in the company (whether directly, or indirectly through one or more interposed entities); and

     * (b) for some or all of the *loss year, that person did _not_ control, and was _not_ able to control, that voting power (directly, or indirectly in that way); and

     * (c) that person began to control, or became able to control, that voting power (directly, or indirectly in that way) for the purpose of:

       * (i) getting some benefit or advantage in relation to how this Act applies; or

       * (ii) getting such a benefit or advantage for someone else;

     * or for purposes including that purpose.

         * Note: A person can still control the voting power in a company that is in liquidation etc.: see section 165250.

    * (2) However, that person's control of the voting power, or ability to control it, does not prevent the company from deducting the *tax loss if the company satisfies the *same business test for the income year (the **_same business test period_**).

    * (3) Apply the *same business test to the *business that the company carried on immediately before the time (the **_test time_**) when the person began to control that voting power, or became able to control it.

         *  For the same business test: see Subdivision 165E.

##### 16520  When company can deduct part of a tax loss

    * (1) If section 16510 (which is about deducting a tax loss) prevents a company from deducting a *tax loss, the company can deduct the _part of the tax loss_ that was incurred during a _part of the loss year_.

    * (2) However, the company can do this only if, assuming that_ part_ of the *loss year had been treated as the _whole_ of the loss year for the purposes of section 16510, the company would have been entitled to deduct the *tax loss.

##### 16525  Summary of this Subdivision

    * (1) The company calculates its taxable income for the income year in this way:

Method statement

       * Step 1.	Divide the income year into periods: each change in ownership or control is a dividing point between periods.

       * Step 2.	Treat each period as if it were an income year and work out the notional loss or notional taxable income for that period.

       * Step 3.	Work out the taxable income for the year of the change by adding up:

##### each notional taxable income; and

##### any full year amounts (amounts of assessable income not taken into account at Step 2);

       * and then subtracting any full year deductions (deductions not taken into account at Step 2).

       * Note: Do _not_ take into account any notional loss.

    * (2) As well as a taxable income, the company will have a tax loss. It is the total of:

      *  	each notional loss; and

      *  	excess full year deductions of particular kinds.

    * (3) Special rules apply if the company was in partnership at some time during the income year.

         *  For the special rules that apply if the company was in partnership: see sections 16575 to 16590.

##### 16530  Flow chart showing the application of this Subdivision

         * Note: If the company was a partner during the income year, special rules apply to calculating a notional loss or notional taxable income.

##### When a company must work out its taxable income and tax loss under this Subdivision

##### 16535  On a change of ownership, unless the company satisfies the same business test

    * A company must calculate its taxable income and *tax loss under this Subdivision unless:

     * (a) there are persons who had *more than a 50% stake in the company during the whole of the income year; or

          * Note: See section 165220 for a special alternative to the condition in this paragraph.

     * (b) there is only _part_ of the income year (a part that started at the start of the income year) during which the same persons had *more than a 50% stake in the company, but the company satisfies the *same business test for the _rest_ of the income year (the **_same business test period_**); or

     * (c) the company was a *designated infrastructure project entity during the whole of the income year.

          * Note: See subsection 41535(7) if there is only part of the income year during which the company was a designated infrastructure project entity.

    * For the purposes of paragraph (b), apply the *same business test to the *business that the company carried on immediately before the time (the **_test time_**) when that part ended.

         * Note 1: For the same business test, see Subdivision 165E.

         * Note 2: In the case of a widely held or eligible Division 166 company, Subdivision 166B modifies how this Subdivision applies, unless the company chooses otherwise.

##### 16537  Who has more than a 50% stake in the company during a period

    * (1) If:

     * (a) there are persons who had *more than 50% of the voting power in the company during the whole of a period (the **_ownership test period_**) consisting of the income year or a part of it; and 

     * (b) there are persons who had rights to *more than 50% of the company's dividends during the whole of the ownership test period; and

     * (c) there are persons who had rights to *more than 50% of the company's capital distributions during the whole of the ownership test period;

    * those persons had **_more than a 50% stake_** in the company during the ownership test period.

    * (2) To work out whether a condition in subsection (1) was satisfied during the *ownership test period, apply the primary test for that condition unless subsection (3) requires the alternative test to be applied.

         *  For the primary tests: see subsections 165150(1), 165155(1)
         *  and 165160(1).


    * (3) Apply the alternative test for that condition if one or more other companies beneficially owned *shares, or interests in shares, in the company at any time during the *ownership test period.

         *  For the alternative tests: see subsections 165150(2), 165155(2)
         *  and 165160(2).


    * Conditions in subsection (1) may be treated as having been satisfied in certain circumstances

    * (4) If any of the conditions in subsection (1) have not been satisfied, those conditions are taken to have been satisfied if:

     * (a) they would have been satisfied except for the operation of section 165165; and

     * (b) the company has information from which it would be reasonable to conclude that less than 50% of the *notional loss for the *ownership test period has been reflected in deductions, capital losses, or reduced assessable income, that occurred, or could occur in future, because of the happening of any *CGT event in relation to any *direct equity interests or *indirect equity interests in the company during that period.

    * (4A) If the company is:

     * (a) a *nonprofit company; or

     * (b) a *mutual affiliate company; or

     * (c) a *mutual insurance company;

    * during the whole of the *ownership test period, the conditions in paragraphs (1)(b) and (c) are taken to have been satisfied by the company.

    * Time of happening of CGT event

    * (5) The happening of a *CGT event in relation to a *direct equity interest or *indirect equity interest in the company that results in the failure of the company to satisfy a condition in subsection (1) is taken, for the purposes of paragraph (4)(b), to have occurred during the *ownership test period.

##### 16540  On a change of control of the voting power in the company, unless the company satisfies the same business test

    * (1) A company must calculate its taxable income and tax loss under this Subdivision if, during the income year, a person begins to control, or becomes able to control, the voting power in the company (whether directly, or indirectly through one or more interposed entities) for the purpose, or for purposes including the purpose, of:

     * (a) getting some benefit or advantage in relation to how this Act applies; or

     * (b) getting such a benefit or advantage for someone else.

         * Note: A person can still control the voting power in a company that is in liquidation etc.: see section 165250.

    * (2) However, that person's control of the voting power, or ability to control it, does not require the company to calculate its taxable income under this Subdivision if the company satisfies the *same business test for the _rest_ of the income year (the **_same business test period_**).

    * (3) Apply the *same business test to the *business that the company carried on immediately before the time (the **_test time_**) when the person began to control that voting power, or became able to control it.

         *  For the same business test: see Subdivision 165E.

##### Working out the company's taxable income

##### 16545  First, divide the income year into periods

    * (1) Divide the income year into periods as follows.

    * (2) The first period starts at the start of the income year. Each later period starts immediately after the end of the previous period.

    * (3) The last period ends at the end of the income year. Each period (except the last) ends at the _earlier_ of:

     * (a) the _latest_ time that would result in persons having *more than a 50% stake in the company during the whole of the period; or

     * (b) the _earliest_ time when a person begins to control, or becomes able to control, the voting power in the company (whether directly, or indirectly through one or more interposed entities) for the purpose, or for purposes including the purpose, of:

       * (i) getting some benefit or advantage to do with how this Act applies; or

       * (ii) getting such a benefit or advantage for someone else.

         * Note: See section 165255 for the rule about incomplete periods.

    * (4) However, what would otherwise be 2 or more successive periods are treated as a single period if the company satisfies the *same business test for all of them, considered as a single period (the **_same business test period_**). Apply the same business test to the *business the company carried on immediately before the end of the first of the periods (the **_test time_**).

         * Note 1: For the same business test, see Subdivision 165E.

         * Note 2: See section 165225 for a special alternative to subsections (3) and (4) of this section.

##### 16550  Next, calculate the notional loss or notional taxable income for each period

    * (1) The company has a *notional loss for a period if the deductions attributed to the period under section 16555 exceed the assessable income attributed to the period under section 16560. The **_notional loss_** is the amount of the excess.

         * For a period during which the company was in partnership,
         *  the notional loss is worked out under section 16575.


    * (2) On the other hand, if that assessable income exceeds those deductions, the company has a **_notional taxable income_** for the period, equal to the excess.

         * For a period during which the company was in partnership,
         *  the notional taxable income is worked out under section 16575.


    * (3) If the company has a *notional loss for _none_ of the periods in the income year, this Subdivision has no further application, and the company's taxable income for the income year is calculated in the usual way.

         * The usual way of working out taxable income is set out in section 415.

##### 16555  How to attribute deductions to periods

    * (1) The company's deductions for the income year are attributed to periods in the income year as follows.

    * (2) The following deductions are attributed to each period in proportion to the length of the period:

     * (a) deductions for the decline in value of a *depreciating asset;

         * See Division 40.

     * (b) deductions for *exploration or prospecting, or *mining capital expenditure, in connection with mining or quarrying;

         * See section 4080 and Subdivisions 40H and 40I.

     * (c) deductions for expenditure, deductions for which are spread over 2 or more income years, but not:

       * (i) deductions for exploration or prospecting, or capital expenditure, in connection with mining or quarrying; or

         * See Subdivision 40I.

       * (ii) *full year deductions (see subsection (5));

     * (d) deductions for expenditure of capital monies in connection with an Australian *film.

         * See former section 124ZAFA of the _Income Tax Assessment Act 1936_.

    * (3) All other deductions (except *full year deductions) are attributed to periods as if each period were an income year.

    * (4) *Full year deductions are not attributed to any of the periods. They are brought in at a later stage of the process of calculating the company's taxable income for the income year.

    * (5) These are **_full year deductions_**:

     * (a) deductions for bad debts under section 81 (about general deductions) or section 2535 (about bad debts);

     * (b) deductions for losses on debt/equity swaps under section 63E of the _Income Tax Assessment Act 1936_;

     * (c) deductions, so far as they are allowable under Division 8 (which is about deductions) because Subdivision H (Period of deductibility of certain advance expenditure) of Division 3 of Part III of the _Income Tax Assessment Act 1936_ applies to the company in relation to the income year;

     * (fa) deductions for payments of pensions, gratuities or retiring allowances under section 2550;

     * (fb) deductions for gifts under Division 30;

     * (f) deductions for *tax losses of earlier income years.

         * See Division 36.

    * (6) However, a deduction for the balance of capital expenditure is _not_ a **_full year deduction_** if the deduction results from the disposal, loss, lapse, termination of use or destruction of the property.

##### 16560  How to attribute assessable income to periods

    * (1) The company's assessable income for the income year is attributed to periods in the income year as follows.

    * (2) The following amounts are attributed to periods so far as they are reasonably attributable to those periods:

     * (a) amounts included in the company's assessable income under section 97 (Beneficiary of a trust estate who is not under a legal disability) of the _Income Tax Assessment Act 1936_; or

     * (b) amounts included in the company's assessable income under section 98A (Nonresident beneficiaries assessable in respect of certain income) of the _Income Tax Assessment Act 1936_.

    * (2A) However, so much of an amount included in the company's assessable income under section 97 or 98A of the _Income Tax Assessment Act 1936_ as is a *capital gain that forms part of a *net capital gain is not attributed to a period.

    * (3) The following items of assessable income are attributed to each period in proportion to the length of the period:

     * (a) insurance recoveries for loss of livestock or trees;

         * See section 385130.

     * (b) amounts included in assessable income as a result of elections relating to the forced disposal of livestock; 

         * See Subdivision 385E and section 385160.

     * (c) recoupment of mains electricity connection expenditure.

         * See items 1.16 and 2.5 in section 2030, which lists deductions for which recoupments are assessable under Subdivision 20A.

    * (4) An amount included in the company's assessable income under section 385135 (Election to defer including profit on second wool clip) is attributed to the period when the wool would ordinarily have been shorn.

    * (5) An amount included in the company's assessable income that is a *dividend under:

     * (a) section 65 (Payments to associated persons); or

     * (c) section 109 (Excessive payments to shareholders and associates);

    * of the _Income Tax Assessment Act 1936_ is attributed to the period when the amount was paid or credited, whichever occurred first.

    * (6) All other items of assessable income (except *full year amounts) are attributed to periods as if each period were an income year.

    * (6A) A *net capital gain is not attributed to a period.

         * Note: This is because Subdivision 165CB provides for how the company must work out its net capital gain for the income year.

    * (7) **_Full year amounts_** are amounts referred to in paragraphs (2)(a) and (b), so far as they are _not_ reasonably attributable to a period, but do not include any part of a *capital gain that forms part of a *net capital gain. Full year amounts are brought in at a later stage of the process of calculating the company's taxable income for the income year.

##### 16565  How to calculate the company's taxable income for the income year

    * (1) The company's **_taxable income_** for the income year is calculated as follows.

    * (2) Add up the *notional taxable incomes (if any) worked out under section 16550 or 16575.

         * Note: A notional _loss_ for a period is _not_ taken into account, but counts towards the company's tax loss for the income year.

    * (3) Add the *full year amounts referred to in subsection 16560(7) (if any) and any *net capital gain of the company for the income year.

    * (4) Subtract the company's *full year deductions of these kinds:

     * (a) deductions for bad debts under section 81 (about general deductions) or section 2535 (about bad debts);

     * (c) deductions, so far as they are allowable under Division 8 (which is about deductions) because Subdivision H (Period of deductibility of certain advance expenditure) of Division 3 of Part III of the _Income Tax Assessment Act 1936_ applies to the company in relation to the income year;

    * unless they exceed the total of the *notional taxable incomes and the *full year amounts. (If they equal or exceed that total, the company does not have a taxable income for the income year.)

    * (5) If an amount remains, subtract from it the company's other *full year deductions, in the order shown in subsection 16555(5), unless they exceed the amount remaining. (If they equal or exceed that amount, the company does not have a taxable income for the income year.)

    * (6) If an amount remains, it is the company's **_taxable income_** for the income year.

##### Working out the company's tax loss

##### 16570  How to calculate the company's tax loss for the income year

    * (1) The company's **_tax loss_** for the income year is calculated as follows.

    * (2) Total the *notional losses worked out under section 16550 or 16575.

    * (3) Add to the total in subsection (2) the amount (if any) by which the company's *full year deductions of these kinds:

     * (a) deductions for bad debts under section 81 (about general deductions) or section 2535 (about bad debts);

     * (c) deductions, so far as they are allowable under Division 8 (which is about deductions) because Subdivision H (Period of deductibility of certain advance expenditure) of Division 3 of Part III of the _Income Tax Assessment Act 1936_ applies to the company in relation to the income year;

    * exceed the total of: 

     * (d) the *notional taxable incomes (if any); and

         *  To work out the notional taxable income: see section 16550.

     * (e) the *full year amounts referred to in section 16560 (if any); and

     * (f) any *net capital gain of the company for the income year.

    * (4) If the company *derived exempt income, subtract its *net exempt income (worked out under section 3620).

    * (5) Any amount remaining is the company's **_tax loss_** for the income year, which is called a **_loss year_**.

         * Note: The meanings of **_tax loss_** and **_loss year_** are modified by section 3655 for a corporate tax entity that has an amount of excess franking offsets.

         * To find out _how much_ of the tax loss can be deducted in later income years: see Subdivision 165A.
         * To find out _how_ to deduct it: see section 3617.


##### Special rules that apply if the company is in partnership

##### 16575  How to calculate the company's notional loss or notional taxable income for a period when the company was a partner

    * (1) This section applies if at any time during a period the company was a partner in one or more partnerships.

    * (2) The company has a *notional loss for the period if the total (the **_loss total_**) of:

     * (a) the deductions attributed to the period under section 16555; and

     * (b) the *company's share of each *notional loss (if any) of a partnership for the period;

    * exceeds the total (the **_income total_**) of:

     * (c) the assessable income attributed to the period under section 16560; and

     * (d) the *company's share of each *notional net income (if any) of a partnership for the period.

    * The **_notional loss_** is the amount of the excess.

         * Note: A notional loss is taken into account in working out the company's tax loss under section 16570.

    * (3) On the other hand, if the income total exceeds the loss total, the company has a **_notional taxable income_** for the period, equal to the excess.

         * Note: A notional taxable income is taken into account in working out the company's taxable income under section 16565.

    * (4) If the company has a *notional taxable income for _all_ periods in the income year, this Subdivision has no further application, and the company's taxable income for the income year is calculated in the usual way.

         * Note: The usual way of working out taxable income is set out in section 415.

##### 16580  How to calculate the company's share of a partnership's notional loss or notional net income for a period if both entities have the same income year

    * (1) This section applies if at any time during a period the company is a partner in a partnership that has an income year that starts and ends when the company's income year starts and ends.

    * (2) The partnership's **_notional loss_** or **_notional net income_** for the period is calculated in the same way as the *notional loss or *notional taxable income of a company.

    * (3) The **_company's share_** is calculated by dividing:

      *  	the company's interest in the partnership's net income or partnership loss of the income year;

    * by

      *  	the amount of that net income or partnership loss;

    * and expressing the result as a percentage.

    * (4) However, if the partnership had neither a net income nor a partnership loss, the **_company's share_** is a percentage that is fair and reasonable having regard to the extent of the company's interest in the partnership.

##### 16585  How to calculate the company's share of a partnership's notional loss or notional net income for a period if the entities have different income years

    * (1) This section applies if at any time during a period the company is a partner in a partnership that has an income year that starts and ends at a different time from when the company's income year starts and ends.

    * (2) So much of the partnership's net income or partnership loss of an income year as was *derived during the period is a **_notional net income_** or **_notional loss_** of the partnership for the period. (For the purposes of this subsection, the partnership's net income or partnership loss is calculated without taking account of the partnership's *full year deductions for that income year.)

         * Note: The partnership's full year deductions are dealt with in section 16590.

    * (3) The **_company's share_** is calculated by dividing:

      *  	the company's interest in the partnership's net income or partnership loss of that income year;

    * by

      *  	the amount of that net income or partnership loss;

    * and expressing the result as a percentage.

##### 16590  Company's full year deductions include a share of partnership's full year deductions

    * (1) This section applies if at any time during the income year the company is a partner in a partnership that has one or more *full year deductions for the income year of the partnership that corresponds to the income year of the company.

    * (2) The partnership's *full year deductions are treated as full year deductions of the company, but only to the extent of the *company's share.

    * (3) If the partnership's income year is the same as the company's, the **_company's share_** is calculated by dividing:

      *  	the company's interest in the partnership's net income or partnership loss of the income year;

    * by

      *  	the amount of that net income or partnership loss;

    * and expressing the result as a percentage.

    * (4) However, if the partnership had neither a net income nor a partnership loss, the **_company's share_** is a percentage that is fair and reasonable having regard to the extent of the company's interest in the partnership.

    * (5) If the partnership's income year does not start and end at the same time as the company's income year, the **_company's share_** is a percentage that is fair and reasonable having regard to all relevant circumstances.

##### Subdivision 165CA--Applying net capital losses of earlier income years

##### Guide to Subdivision 165CA

##### 16593  What this Subdivision is about

    * In working out its net capital gain for an income year, a company cannot apply a net capital loss for an earlier income year unless:

         * (a) it has the same owners and the same control from the start of the loss year to the end of the income year; or

         * (b) it satisfies the same business test by carrying on the same business, entering into no new kinds of transactions and conducting no new kinds of business.

##### Operative provisions

##### 16596  When a company cannot apply a net capital loss

    * (1) In working out its *net capital gain for the *current year, a company cannot apply a *net capital loss it has for an earlier income year if Subdivision 165A would prevent it from deducting the loss for the current year if:

     * (a) the loss were a *tax loss of the company for that earlier income year; and

     * (b) section 16520 (about deducting part of a tax loss) were disregarded.

         * Note 1: A company's net capital gain for an income year is usually worked out under section 1025.

         * Note 2: Subdivision 165A deals with the deductibility of a company's tax loss for an earlier income year if there has been a change in the ownership or control of the company in the period from the start of the loss year to the end of the income year.

         * Note 3: Subdivision 165F may affect the application of Subdivision 165A.

    * (2) If subsection (1) prevents the company from applying the *net capital loss, it can apply the _part_ of the loss that it made during a _part_ of that earlier income year, but only if, assuming that part of that income year had been treated as the whole of it, the company would have been entitled to apply the net capital loss.

##### Subdivision 165CB--Working out the net capital gain and the net capital loss for the income year of the change

##### Guide to Subdivision 165CB

##### 16599  What this Subdivision is about

    * A company that has not had the same ownership and control during the income year, and has not satisfied the same business test, works out its net capital gain and net capital loss under this Subdivision.

##### 165102  On a change of ownership, or of control of voting power, unless the company satisfies the same business test

    * A company must calculate its *net capital gain and *net capital loss for the income year under this Subdivision if:

     * (a) it must calculate its taxable income and *tax loss for the income year under Subdivision 165B; or

          * Note: Subdivision 165F may affect the application of Subdivision 165B.

     * (b) it would be required to calculate them under that Subdivision but for subsection 16550(3) (about cases where that Subdivision would make no difference to the taxable income).

         * Note: In the case of a widely held or eligible Division 166 company, Subdivision 166B modifies how this Subdivision applies, unless the company chooses otherwise.

##### Working out the company's net capital gain and net capital loss

##### 165105  First, divide the income year into periods

    * Divide the income year into periods according to section 16545 (which is about working out the company's taxable income under Subdivision 165B).

##### 165108  Next, calculate the notional net capital gain or notional net capital loss for each period

    * (1) The company has a **_notional net capital gain_** for a period if the total of the *capital gains it made during the period exceeds the total of the *capital losses it made during the period. The **_notional net capital gain_** is the amount of the excess.

    * (2) On the other hand, if the total of those losses exceeds the total of those gains, the company has a **_notional net capital loss_** for the period, equal to the excess.

    * (3) If the company has a *notional net capital loss for none of the periods in the income year, this Subdivision has no further application, and the company's *net capital gain for the income year is calculated in the usual way.

         * The usual way of working out the net capital gain is set out in section 1025.

    * Trust's capital gain attributed to company beneficiary

    * (4) If some or all (the **_attributable amount_**) of an amount included in the company's assessable income for the income year under:

     * (a) section 97 (Beneficiary of a trust estate who is not under a legal disability) of the _Income Tax Assessment Act 1936_; or

     * (b) section 98A (Nonresident beneficiaries assessable in respect of certain income) of that Act;

    * is attributable to a *capital gain that the trust made at a particular time during the period, this section applies to the attributable amount as if it were a *capital gain made by the company at that time.

##### 165111  How to work out the company's net capital gain

    * The company's **_net capital gain_** for the income year is worked out in this way:

Working out the company's net capital gain

       * Step 1.	Add up the *notional net capital gains (if any) worked out under section 165108.

            * _	_Note:	A notional net capital _loss_ for a period is _not_ taken into account, but counts towards the company's net capital loss for the income year.

       * Step 2.	Add to the Step 1 amount so much of each amount included in the company's assessable income for the income year under:

         * _	_(a)	section 97 (Beneficiary of a trust estate who is not under a legal disability) of the _Income Tax Assessment Act 1936_; or

         * _	_(b)	section 98A (Nonresident beneficiaries assessable in respect of certain income) of that Act;

       * _	_as is attributable to a *capital gain that the trust made outside the income year.

            * _	_Note:	This is relevant only if the trust has an income year that starts and ends at a different time from when the company's income year starts and ends.

       * Step 3.	If the Step 2 amount is _more than_ zero, reduce it by applying any unapplied *net capital losses from previous income years. (If this reduces it to zero, the company has no net capital gain for the income year.)

            * _	_Note:	To apply net capital losses: see section 10215.

       * Step 4.	If the Step 3 amount is _more than_ zero, it is the company's **_net capital gain_**.

         * Note : For exceptions and modifications to these rules: see section 10230.

##### 165114  How to work out the company's net capital loss

    * The company's **_net capital loss_** for the income year is worked out in this way:

Working out the company's net capital loss

       * Step 1.	Add up the *notional net capital losses (if any) worked out under section 165108.

       * Step 2.	If the Step 1 amount is _more than_ zero, it is the company's **_net capital loss_**.

         * Note: For exceptions and modifications to these rules: see section 10230.

##### Subdivision 165CC--Change of ownership or control of company that has an unrealised net loss

##### Guide to Subdivision 165CC

##### 165115  What this Subdivision is about

    * If a change occurs in the ownership or control of a company that has an unrealised net loss, the company cannot, to the extent of the unrealised net loss, have capital losses taken into account, or deduct revenue losses, in respect of CGT events that happen to CGT assets that it owned at the time of the change, unless it satisfies the same business test.

##### 165115AA  Special rules to save compliance costs

    * (1) A company is exempt from these rules if, at the time of the change in ownership or control, it (together with certain related entities) has a net asset value of not more than $6,000,000 under the test in section 15215 (for small business CGT relief).

    * (2) In working out whether it has an unrealised net loss, a company can choose to work out the market value of each of its assets individually, or of all of its assets together.

    * (3) If a company works out the market value of each of its assets individually, it may choose to exclude every asset that it acquired for less than $10,000, in which case:

     * (a) unrealised losses and gains on the excluded assets will not be taken into account in calculating the company's unrealised net loss; and

     * (b) losses on the excluded assets will be allowed without the company being subject to the same business test.

##### Operative provisions

##### 165115A  Application of Subdivision

    * Application

    * (1) This Subdivision applies to a company if:

     * (a) a changeover time has occurred or occurs in relation to the company after the commencement time; and

     * (b) at the changeover time the company had an unrealised net loss (see section 165115E); and

     * (c) either of the following applies:

       * (i) the company makes a *capital loss, or apart from this Subdivision would be entitled to a deduction, in respect of a *CGT event that happens to a *CGT asset referred to in subsection (1A);

       * (ii) the company makes a *trading stock loss in respect of a CGT asset referred to in subsection (1A) that is an item of *trading stock; and

     * (d) the company would not, at the changeover time, satisfy the maximum net asset value test under section 15215.

    * CGT assets in respect of which Subdivision applies

    * (1A) The *CGT assets for the purposes of paragraph 165115A(1)(c) are:

     * (a) any CGT asset that the company owned at the changeover time; and

     * (b) any CGT asset that the company did not own at the changeover time but had owned at a previous time, where:

       * (i) a deferral event referred to in subsection 170255(1) happened before the changeover time; and

       * (ii) the deferral event involved the company as the originating company referred to in that subsection; and

       * (iii) the deferral event would have resulted in the company making a *capital loss, or becoming entitled to a deduction, in respect of the CGT asset except for section 170270; and

       * (iv) the company is not taken to have made a capital loss at or before the changeover time, or to have become entitled to a deduction at that time, under section 170275 in respect of the asset.

    * Company may choose to disregard CGT assets acquired for less than $10,000

    * (1B) A company may choose, for the purposes of the application of this Subdivision to it in respect of a particular changeover time, that every *CGT asset that has been acquired by it for less than $10,000 is to be disregarded.

    * However, the choice does not affect the application of the *global method of working out whether the company has an unrealised net loss (see subsection 165115E(2)).

    * Time for making choice

    * (1C) A choice under subsection (1B) must be made on or before:

     * (a) the day on which the company lodges its *income tax return for the income year in which the relevant changeover time occurred; or

     * (b) such later day as the Commissioner allows.

    * Trading stock loss

    * (1D) A company is taken to have made a **_trading stock loss_** in respect of an asset that is an item of *trading stock if, and only if:

     * (a) one of the following applies:

       * (i) the company *disposes of the item;

       * (ii) the item stops being trading stock (within the meaning of section 7080);

       * (iii) the item is revalued under Division 70; and

     * (b) if subparagraph (a)(i) or (ii) applies--the item's *market value at the time when it is disposed of or stops being trading stock is less than:

       * (i) in respect of an item that has been valued under Division 70--its latest value under the Division; or

       * (ii) otherwise--its cost at that time; and

     * (c) if subparagraph (a)(iii) applies--the item's value under the revaluation is less than:

       * (i) in respect of an item that has previously been valued under Division 70--its latest value under that Division before the revaluation; or

       * (ii) otherwise--its cost at the time of the revaluation.

    * The difference worked out under paragraph (b) or (c), as the case may be, constitutes the amount of the *trading stock loss.

    * Commencement time

    * (2) For the purposes of this Subdivision, the **_commencement time_** of a company is:

     * (a) if the company was in existence at 1 pm (by legal time in the Australian Capital Territory) on 11 November 1999--that time; or

     * (b) if the company came into existence after that time--the time when it came into existence.

    * Reference time

    * (2A) For the purposes of the application of this Subdivision to a company in relation to a particular time (the **_test time_**), the **_reference time_** is:

     * (a) if no changeover time occurred in respect of the company before the test time--the commencement time; or

     * (b) otherwise--the time immediately after the last changeover time that occurred in respect of the company before the test time.

    * Asset owned at more than one changeover time

    * (3) If:

     * (a) 2 or more changeover times have occurred or occur in relation to a company; and

     * (b) the company owned a particular asset at more than one of those changeover times;

    * this Subdivision applies to the company in respect of that asset only in relation to the later or latest of those changeover times.

         * Note: For **_changeover time_** see sections 165115C and 165115D.

##### 165115B  What happens when the company makes a capital loss or becomes entitled to a deduction in respect of a CGT asset after a changeover time

    * Where capital loss or deduction is equal to or less than residual unrealised net loss

    * (1) If the *capital loss or deduction referred to in subparagraph 165115A(1)(c)(i) is equal to or less than the company's residual unrealised net loss at the time of the occurrence of the event that resulted in the capital loss or entitled the company to the deduction:

     * (a) the capital loss is taken to have been a *net capital loss; or

     * (b) the deduction is taken to have been a *tax loss;

    * of the company for the income year immediately before the income year in which the changeover time occurred.

    * Where capital loss or deduction is greater than residual unrealised net loss

    * (2) If the *capital loss or deduction referred to in subparagraph 165115A(1)(c)(i) is greater than the company's residual unrealised net loss at the time of the occurrence of the event that resulted in the capital loss or entitled the company to the deduction:

     * (a) the part of the capital loss that is equal to the residual unrealised net loss is taken to have been a *net capital loss; or

     * (b) the part of the deduction that is equal to the residual unrealised net loss is taken to have been a *tax loss;

    * of the company for the income year immediately before the income year in which the changeover time occurred.

    * Company does not meet certain conditions in relation to net capital loss or tax loss

    * (3) The company is taken not to have met, at the changeover time, the conditions in subsections 16512(2), (3) and (4) in relation to the *net capital loss or the *tax loss. The changeover time is the **_test time_** for applying section 16513 to the company.

    * Need to meet same business test

    * (4) The effect of subsection (3) is that the company cannot apply the *net capital loss (see section 16510 as it applies because of section 16596), or deduct the *tax loss (see section 16510), unless it meets the condition in section 16513 (the same business test).

    * Consequences for net capital loss

    * (5) The *net capital loss cannot be applied against *capital gains made in an income year before the income year in which the company made the capital loss referred to in subparagraph 165115A(1)(c)(i).

    * Consequences for tax loss

    * (6) The *tax loss cannot be deducted from assessable income *derived in an income year before the income year in which the company would have been entitled to the deduction referred to in subparagraph 165115A(1)(c)(i).

         * Note: For **_changeover time_** see sections 165115C and 165115D.

##### 165115BA  What happens when a CGT event happens after a changeover time to a CGT asset of the company that is trading stock

    * Application

    * (1) This section applies to the company if, after the changeover time, the company makes a *trading stock loss in respect of an item of *trading stock as mentioned in subparagraph 165115A(1)(c)(ii).

    * Where trading stock loss is equal to or less than residual unrealised net loss

    * (2) If the *trading stock loss is equal to or less than the company's residual unrealised net loss at the time of the occurrence of the trading stock loss, the amount of the trading stock loss is to be included in the company's assessable income.

    * Where trading stock loss is greater than unrealised net loss

    * (3) If the *trading stock loss is greater than the company's residual unrealised net loss at the time of the occurrence of the trading stock loss, the part of the trading stock loss that is equal to the residual unrealised net loss is to be included in the company's assessable income.

    * No increase in assessable income if company satisfies the same business test

    * (4) Neither subsection (2) nor (3) applies to the company if the company meets the condition in section 16513 (the same business test).

    * Assumptions for purposes of same business test

    * (5) In determining whether the company meets the condition in section 16513, assume:

     * (a) that the *trading stock loss (if subsection (2) applies) or the part of the trading stock loss (if subsection (3) applies) is a *net capital loss of the company for the income year immediately before the income year in which the changeover time occurred; and

     * (b) that the company failed, at the changeover time, to meet the condition in subsections 16512(2), (3) and (4) in relation to the net capital loss referred to in paragraph (a); and

     * (c) that the changeover time is the **_test time_**; and

     * (d) that the same business test period is the income year in which the loss occurred.

##### 165115BB  Order of application of assets: residual unrealised net loss

    * Order in which assets are to be applied

    * (1) In applying subsection 165115B(2) or 165115BA(3) in respect of assets that the company owned at the changeover time:

     * (a) the company's *capital losses are taken to have been made, the company is taken to have become entitled to deductions and the company is taken to have made *trading stock losses in the order in which the events that resulted in the capital losses, deductions or trading stock losses occurred; and

     * (b) if 2 or more such events occurred at the same time, they are taken to have occurred in such order as the company determines.

    * Residual unrealised net loss

    * (2) The company's **_residual unrealised net loss_**, at the time of an event (the **_relevant event_**) that resulted in the company making a *capital loss, becoming entitled to a deduction or making a *trading stock loss, in respect of an asset, is the amount worked out using the following formula:

    * where: 

    * **_previous capital losses, deductions or trading stock losses_** means the total of the following:

     * (a) capital losses that the company made, deductions to which the company became entitled, or *trading stock losses that the company made, as a result of events earlier than the relevant event in respect of assets that the company owned at the *changeover time;

     * (b) each reduction that section 715105 (as applying to the company as the *head company of a *consolidated group or *MEC group) makes in respect of such an asset because an entity ceased before the time of the relevant event to be a *subsidiary member of the group (but counting only the greater or greatest such reduction if 2 or more are made for the same asset);

    * or nil if there are none.

    * **_unrealised net loss_** means the company's unrealised net loss at the last changeover time that occurred before the relevant event.

         * Note: For **_changeover time_** see sections 165115C and 165115D.

##### 165115C  Changeover time--change in ownership of company

    * (1) A time (the **_test time_**) is a **_changeover time_** in respect of a company if:

     * (a) persons who had *more than 50% of the voting power in the company at the reference time do not have more than 50% of that voting power immediately after the test time; or

     * (b) persons who had rights to *more than 50% of the company's dividends at the reference time do not have rights to more than 50% of those dividends immediately after the test time; or

     * (c) persons who had rights to *more than 50% of the company's capital distributions at the reference time do not have rights to more than 50% of those distributions immediately after the test time.

         * Note 1: See section 165150 to work out who had more than 50% of the voting power in the company.

         * Note 2: See section 165155 to work out who had rights to more than 50% of the company's dividends.

         * Note 3: See section 165160 to work out who had rights to more than 50% of the company's capital distributions.

         * Note 4: For **_reference time_** see subsection 165115A(2A).

    * (2) To work out whether paragraph (1)(a), (b) or (c) applied at a particular time, apply the primary test unless subsection (3) requires the alternative test to be applied.

         * Note: For the primary test see subsections 165150(1), 165155(1) and 165160(1).

    * (3) Apply the alternative test if one or more other companies beneficially owned *shares or interests in shares in the company at any time during the period from the reference time to the *test time.

         * Note: For the alternative test see subsections 165150(2), 165155(2) and 165160(2).

    * (4) A *test time that would, apart from this subsection, be a changeover time in respect of the company because of the application of subsection (1) is taken not to be a changeover time if:

     * (a) that subsection would not have applied except for the operation of section 165165; and

     * (b) the company has information from which it would be reasonable to conclude that less than 50% of the company's unrealised net loss at the test time has been reflected in deductions, capital losses, or reduced assessable income, that occurred, or could occur in future, because of the happening of any *CGT event in relation to any *direct equity interests or *indirect equity interests in the company during the period from the reference time to the test time.

    * (4A) If the company is:

     * (a) a *nonprofit company; or

     * (b) a *mutual affiliate company; or

     * (c) a *mutual insurance company;

    * during the whole of the period from the reference time to the *test time, the test time is taken not to be a *changeover time in respect of the company because of the application of paragraphs (1)(b) and (c).

    * (5) The happening of any *CGT event in relation to a *direct equity interest or *indirect equity interest in the company that results in the time of the happening of the event being a changeover time in respect of the company is taken, for the purposes of paragraph (4)(b), to have occurred during the period referred to in that paragraph.

##### 165115D  Changeover time--change in control of company

    * (1) A time (the **_test time_**) is also a **_changeover time_** in respect of a company if, at the test time:

     * (a) a person or persons who did not control, and were not able to control, the voting power in the company at the reference time began to control, or became able to control, that voting power immediately after the test time; and

     * (b) that person or those persons so began, or became able, to control that voting power for the purpose of:

       * (i) getting some benefit or advantage in relation to how this Act applies; or

       * (ii) getting such a benefit or advantage for someone else;

     * or for purposes including that purpose.

         * Note: A person can still control the voting power in a company that is in liquidation etc.: see section 165250.

    * (2) In this section:

    * **_control_** of the voting power in a company means control of that voting power either directly, or indirectly through one or more interposed entities.

##### 165115E  What is an unrealised net loss

    * (1) The question whether a company has an **_unrealised net loss_** at a particular time (the **_relevant time_**) is worked out in this way (the **_individual asset method_**), unless the company chooses to work it out using the *global method (set out in subsection (2)).

Method statement

       * Step 1.	Work out under section 165115F in respect of each *CGT asset that the company owned at the relevant time any notional capital gain or notional revenue gain or any notional capital loss or notional revenue loss that the company has at that time in respect of the asset.

       * The sum of the notional capital gains is the company's **_unrealised capital gain_** at the relevant time.

       * The sum of the notional capital losses is the company's **_unrealised capital loss_** at the relevant time.

       * The sum of the notional revenue gains is the company's **_unrealised revenue gain_** at the relevant time.

       * The sum of the notional revenue losses is the company's **_unrealised revenue loss_** at the relevant time.

       * Step 2.	Add up the unrealised capital gain and the unrealised revenue gain at the relevant time. The total is the **_unrealised gross gain_** at that time.

       * Step 3.	Add up the unrealised capital loss and the unrealised revenue loss at the relevant time. The total is the **_unrealised gross loss_** at that time.

       * Step 4.	If the unrealised gross loss at the relevant time exceeds the unrealised gross gain at that time, the excess is the company's **_preliminary unrealised net loss_** at that time.

       * Step 5.	Add up the company's preliminary unrealised net loss and any *capital loss, deduction or share of a deduction disregarded under section 170270 in relation to an asset referred to in paragraph 165115A(1A)(b). The total is the company's **_unrealised net loss_** at the relevant time.

    * (2) The **_global method_** of working out whether the company has an **_unrealised net loss_** at the relevant time is as follows:

Method statement

       * Step 1.	Work out the total *market value of all *CGT assets that the company owned at the relevant time (including those it *acquired for less than $10,000), using a valuation method that would generally be regarded as appropriate in the circumstances.

       * Step 2.	Work out the total of the *cost bases of those *CGT assets at the relevant time.

            * Note: If a CGT asset that the company owned at the relevant time was also trading stock or a revenue asset at that time, see subsection (3) of this section.

       * Step 3.	If the step 2 amount exceeds the step 1 amount, the excess is the company's **_preliminary unrealised net loss_** at the relevant time.

       * Step 4.	Add up the company's preliminary unrealised net loss and any *capital loss, deduction or share of a deduction disregarded under section 170270 in relation to an asset referred to in paragraph 165115A(1A)(b). The total is the company's **_unrealised net loss_** at the relevant time.

    * (3) If:

     * (a) a *CGT asset that the company owned at the relevant time was also *trading stock or a *revenue asset at that time; and

     * (b) the asset's *cost base at the relevant time is _less than_ the amount that would be compared under section 165115F with the asset's *market value in working out a notional revenue gain or notional revenue loss that the company has at the relevant time in respect of the asset;

    * then, for the purposes of step 2 of the method statement in subsection (2) of this section, the amount that would be so compared is to be taken into account _instead of_ that cost base.

    * (4) A choice to use the *global method must be made on or before:

     * (a) the day on which the company lodges its *income tax return for the income year in which the relevant time occurred; or

     * (b) such later day as the Commissioner allows.

##### 165115F  Notional gains and losses

    * (1) This section applies for the purpose of calculating whether a company has at a particular time (the **_relevant time_**) a notional capital gain, a notional capital loss, a notional revenue gain or a notional revenue loss in respect of a *CGT asset that it owned at that time.

    * (2) The calculation is to be made on the assumption that the company disposed of the asset at its *market value at the relevant time.

    * (3) In relation to an asset other than an item of *trading stock:

     * (a) if the company would make a *capital gain in respect of the disposal of the asset--the company has at the relevant time in respect of the asset a **_notional capital gain_** equal to the amount of the capital gain; or

     * (b) if an amount (other than a capital gain) would be included in the company's assessable income in respect of the disposal of the asset--the company has at the relevant time in respect of the asset a **_notional revenue gain_** equal to the amount so included; or

     * (c) if the company would make a *capital loss in respect of the disposal of the asset--the company has at the relevant time in respect of the asset a **_notional capital loss_** equal to the amount of the capital loss; or

     * (d) if the company would be entitled to a deduction in respect of the disposal of the asset--the company has at the relevant time in respect of the asset a **_notional revenue loss_** equal to the amount of the deduction.

    * (4) In relation to an asset that is an item of *trading stock:

     * (a) if the item's *market value at the relevant time exceeds:

       * (i) in respect of an item that has been valued under Division 70--the item's latest valuation under that Division; or

       * (ii) otherwise--the *cost of the item at the relevant time;

     * the company has at the relevant time in respect of the article a **_notional revenue gain_** equal to the excess; or

     * (b) if the item's market value at the relevant time is less than:

       * (i) in respect of an item that has been valued under Division 70--the item's latest valuation under that Division; or

       * (ii) otherwise--the *cost of the item at the relevant time;

     * the company has at the relevant time in respect of the article a **_notional revenue loss_** equal to the difference.

    * (5) A company may choose that this section is to apply to the company at the relevant time in respect of an asset to which subsection (6) applied at that time as if references to the *market value of the asset were references to its *written down value.

    * (6) This subsection applies to an asset at the relevant time if:

     * (a) the asset is a *depreciating asset (not a building or structure) for whose decline in value the company has deducted or can deduct an amount; and

     * (b) the expenditure incurred by the company to *acquire the asset was less than $1,000,000 (the expenditure can include the giving of property: see section 1035); and

     * (c) it would be reasonable for the company to conclude that the *market value of the asset at that time was not less than 80% of its *written down value at that time.

##### Subdivision 165CD--Reductions after alterations in ownership or control of loss company

##### Guide to Subdivision 165CD

##### 165115GA  What this Subdivision is about

    * This Subdivision prevents multiple recognition of a company's losses when significant equity and debt interests that entities (not individuals) have in the company are realised.

##### 165115GB  When adjustments must be made

    * (1) The operation of this Subdivision is triggered at an alteration time, which is when:

     * (a) an alteration takes place in the ownership or control of the company; or

     * (b) a liquidator or administrator of the company declares that shares or financial instruments are worthless (CGT event G3).

    * (2) An alteration time is the trigger for making reductions and other adjustments to the reduced cost base of significant equity and debt interests in the company that are owned by an entity (not an individual) that, alone or with its associates, has a controlling stake in the company and either:

     * (a) has a *direct equity interest or *indirect equity interest of at least 10% in the company; or

     * (b) is owed a debt of at least $10,000 by the company or by another entity that has a significant equity or debt interest in the company.

    * Deductions that relate to such interests held as trading stock or otherwise on revenue account are also reduced.

    * (3) Adjustments may also be made when such an entity's interests in the company are partly realised within 12 months before an alteration time or if, under an arrangement, such interests are realised partly within that period or at the alteration time and partly at an earlier time.

    * (4) However, entities in which there are no interests in respect of which the company's losses have been, or can be, duplicated are not affected by this Subdivision.

##### 165115GC  How adjustments are calculated

    * (1) Adjustments are based on the overall loss of the company. This comprises its realised losses and unrealised losses on CGT assets.

    * (2) Special rules, directed at saving compliance costs, apply to determine whether unrealised losses have to be counted at an alteration time and, if so, how to work them out.

    * (3) The company may not have to calculate its unrealised losses if the alteration time is not also a changeover time for the purposes of Subdivision 165CC (about change of ownership or control of a company that has an unrealised net loss), and the company has no realised losses.

    * (4) The company does not have to count unrealised losses at an alteration time if (together with certain related entities) it has a net asset value of not more than $6,000,000 under the test in section 15215 (for small business CGT relief).

    * (5) In working out its unrealised losses on CGT assets, the company can choose to work out the *market value of each of its assets individually, or of all of its assets together.

    * (6) If the company works out the *market value of each of its assets individually, unrealised losses on assets acquired for less than $10,000 do not have to be calculated at any time.

    * (7) Amounts (whether realised or unrealised) counted at a previous alteration time are not counted again at a later alteration time. (This does not apply to unrealised losses worked out by reference to the *market value of all the company's assets together.)

    * (8) However, if unrealised amounts are _not_ counted at a previous alteration time (for example, because of the $10,000 exclusion, or because you satisfy the maximum net asset value test in section 15215) and are not required to be taken into account in adjustments made at that time, they may be counted at a later time as part of a realised loss.

    * (9) A formula is provided for making adjustments in straightforward cases if applying the formula gives a reasonable result having regard to the object of the Subdivision. Otherwise, reasonable adjustments must be made having regard to a number of stated factors.

    * (10) To help entities to make the adjustments, any entity that, in its own right, has a controlling stake in the company is required to provide a written notice to its associates setting out relevant information. In limited circumstances, the company itself may have to provide a written notice to entities that, to its knowledge, have a significant equity or debt interest in it.

##### 165115H  How this Subdivision applies

    * (1) This Subdivision provides for certain taxation consequences for an entity (not an individual) that had a significant equity or debt interest in a loss company immediately before an alteration time occurred in respect of the company.

    * (2) The following flowchart explains how to work out whether this Subdivision applies to an entity.

    * (3) If this Subdivision applies to an entity, reductions are made to:

     * (a) the reduced cost base of the entity's equity or debt (see subsection 165115ZA(3)); or

     * (b) any deduction to which the entity is entitled in respect of the disposal of the equity or debt (see subsection 165115ZA(4)); or

     * (c) deductions in respect of, and the cost of, any of the equity or debt that is trading stock (see subsection 165115ZA(5)).

         * Example: The following is an example of how this Subdivision operates:

         * Facts: Alpha Co acquired 80% of the shares in Beta Co on 5 May 1998 for $1,000.

         * Gamma Co owns 20% of the shares in Beta Co.

         * On 6 February 2000, Alpha Co disposed of its shares for $600.

         * At the beginning of the 19992000 income year, Beta Co had an unapplied net capital loss of $500 from the 199899 income year. This loss was fully reflected in the market value of shares in Beta Co.

         * Alpha Co and Gamma Co are not associated in any way.

         * Result: 

         * Step 1: An alteration time occurred in respect of Beta Co as a result of the change in ownership that occurred when Alpha Co sold its shares.

         * Step 2: Beta Co was a loss company at the alteration time because it had an unapplied net capital loss from an earlier income year.

         * Step 3: Alpha Co had a relevant equity interest in Beta Co immediately before the alteration time because it had a controlling stake and significant interest (80% equity interest). Gamma Co did not have a relevant equity interest in Beta Co because it did not have a controlling stake.

         * Step 4: Because Alpha Co had a relevant equity interest in Beta Co, the reduced cost bases of its shares in Beta Co are reduced by 80% of Beta Co's net capital loss:

         * Alpha Co does not make a capital gain on the disposal of its shares in Beta Co because the capital proceeds ($600) are less than the cost bases ($1,000).

         * Nor did Alpha Co make a capital loss on the disposal of its shares in Beta Co because the capital proceeds ($600) are not less than the reduced cost bases as further reduced by this Subdivision ($600).

         * The net capital loss in Beta Co is not duplicated on the sale of Alpha Co's shares in Beta Co.

         * Step 5.	There are no notice requirements in this simple case. If Gamma Co and Alpha Co were associates (so that Gamma Co had a relevant equity interest in Beta Co), Alpha Co would need to provide the following information to Gamma Co:

          * (a) the alteration time: 6 February 2000;

          * (b) Beta Co's overall loss at the alteration time: $500;

          * (c) details of the overall loss: a net capital loss of $500 for the 199899 income year.

##### Operative provisions

##### 165115J  Object of Subdivision

    * The main object of this Subdivision is to make appropriate adjustments (under section 165115ZA) to the tax values of significant equity and debt interests held directly or indirectly by entities other than individuals in a *loss company whose ownership or control alters.
    * The purpose of the adjustments is to prevent the duplication of the company's realised and unrealised losses when any of those interests are *disposed of or otherwise realised. This happens because the company's losses are reflected in the values of the interests.


##### 165115K  Application and interpretation

    * Application

    * (1) This Subdivision applies if:

     * (a) an alteration time occurs in respect of a company; and

     * (b) the company is a *loss company at the alteration time; and

     * (c) one or more entities had relevant equity interests or relevant debt interests in the company immediately before the alteration time.

         * Note 1: For **_alteration time_**, see sections 165115L, 165115M, 165115N, 165115P and 165115Q.

         * Note 2: For **_relevant equity interests_** and **_relevant debt interests_**, see sections 165115X and 165115Y.

    * Alteration time before commencement time to be disregarded

    * (2) An **_alteration time_** does not include a time before the commencement time.

    * Commencement time

    * (3) The **_commencement time_** for a company is:

     * (a) if the company was in existence at 1 pm (by legal time in the Australian Capital Territory) on 11 November 1999--that time; or

     * (b) if the company came into existence after that time--the time when it came into existence.

    * Certain alteration times to be disregarded

    * (4) If:

     * (a) a time (the **_test time_**) would, apart from this subsection, be an alteration time in relation to a company; and

     * (b) the company does not have any losses of the kinds referred to in paragraph65115R(3)(a), (b), (c) and (d) and 165115S(3)(a) and (b); and

     * (c) the test time is not a changeover time in relation to the company under Subdivision 165CC; and

     * (d) if the test time were such a changeover time, it would be reasonable for the company to conclude that it would not have an unrealised net loss at that time under section 165115E;

    * the test time is taken not to be an alteration time in relation to the company.

    * Application to CGT events other than disposals

    * (5) This Subdivision applies to a *CGT event (other than a *disposal) happening in relation to a CGT asset (for example, an interest in a company that is constituted by an equity or debt):

     * (a) in the same way as it applies to a disposal of a CGT asset; and

     * (b) as if the asset had been disposed of at the time when the CGT event happens.

##### 165115L  Alteration time--alteration in ownership of company

    * (1) A time (the **_test time_**) is an **_alteration time_** in respect of a company if:

     * (a) persons who had *more than 50% of the voting power in the company at the reference time do not have more than 50% of that voting power immediately after the test time; or

     * (b) persons who had rights to *more than 50% of the company's dividends at the reference time do not have rights to more than 50% of those dividends immediately after the test time; or

     * (c) persons who had rights to *more than 50% of the company's capital distributions at the reference time do not have rights to more than 50% of those distributions immediately after the test time.

         * Note 1: See section 165150 to work out who had more than 50% of the voting power in the company.

         * Note 2: See section 165155 to work out who had rights to more than 50% of the company's dividends.

         * Note 3: See section 165160 to work out who had rights to more than 50% of the company's capital distributions.

    * (2) The **_reference time_** is:

     * (a) if no alteration time occurred in respect of the company before the *test time--the commencement time; or

     * (b) otherwise--the time immediately after the last alteration time.

    * (3) To work out whether paragraph (1)(a), (b) or (c) applied at a particular time, apply the primary test unless subsection (4) requires the alternative test to be applied.

         * Note: For the primary test see subsections 165150(1), 165155(1) and 165160(1).

    * (4) Apply the alternative test if one or more other companies beneficially owned *shares or interests in shares in the company at any time during the period from the reference time to the *test time.

         * Note: For the alternative test see subsections 165150(2), 165155(2) and 165160(2).

    * (5) If the company is:

     * (a) a *nonprofit company; or

     * (b) a *mutual affiliate company; or

     * (c) a *mutual insurance company;

    * during the whole of the period from the reference time to the *test time, the test time is taken not to be an *alteration time in respect of the company because of the application of paragraphs (1)(b) and (c).

##### 165115M  Alteration time--alteration in control of company

    * (1) A time (the **_test time_**) is also an **_alteration time_** in respect of a company if, at the test time:

     * (a) a person or persons who did not control, and were not able to control, the voting power in the company at the reference time began to control, or became able to control, that voting power immediately after the test time; and

     * (b) that person or those persons so began, or became able, to control that voting power for the purpose of:

       * (i) getting some benefit or advantage in relation to how this Act applies; or

       * (ii) getting such a benefit or advantage for someone else;

     * or for purposes including that purpose.

         * Note: A person can still control the voting power in a company that is in liquidation etc.: see section 165250.

    * (2) The **_reference time_** is:

     * (a) if no alteration time occurred in respect of the company before the *test time--the commencement time; or

     * (b) otherwise--the time immediately after the last alteration time.

    * (3) In this section:

    * **_control_** of the voting power in a company means control of that voting power either directly, or indirectly through one or more interposed entities.

##### 165115N  Alteration time--declaration by liquidator or administrator

    * If a liquidator or administrator makes a declaration referred to in section 104145 in relation to a company, the time of the declaration is also an **_alteration time_** in respect of the company.

##### 165115P  Notional alteration time--disposal of interests in company within 12 months before alteration time

    * (1) This section applies if:

     * (a) an alteration time occurs in respect of a *loss company; and

     * (b) an entity *disposed of an interest in the company (an **_equity_**) or a debt (a **_debt_**) at a time (the **_disposal time_**) within 12 months before the alteration time but not earlier than the commencement time; and

     * (c) immediately before the disposal time, the entity had a relevant equity interest or a relevant debt interest in the company that included the equity or debt, or would have had such an interest if any previous disposals of interests or debts by the entity had not occurred; and

     * (d) immediately before the alteration time, the entity had a relevant equity interest or a relevant debt interest in the company, or would have had such an interest if any previous disposals of interests or debts by the entity had not occurred.

    * (2) The references in paragraphs (1)(c) and (d) to previous *disposals of interests or debts by the entity are references to:

     * (a) previous disposals within the period referred to in paragraph (1)(b); and

     * (b) previous disposals before that period if those previous disposals and any one or more of the following:

       * (i) the disposal of the equity or debt;

       * (ii) a disposal referred to in paragraph (a);

       * (iii) a disposal at the alteration time;

     * occurred as part of an *arrangement.

    * (3) The time immediately before the *disposal of the equity or debt is taken to have been an alteration time (a **_notional alteration time_**) in respect of the company.

    * (4) The entity:

     * (a) is taken to have had, immediately before the notional alteration time, a relevant equity interest in the company constituted by the equity or a relevant debt interest in the company constituted by the debt, as the case may be; and

     * (b) is taken not to have had, immediately before the notional alteration time, any other relevant equity interest or relevant debt interest in the company.

    * (6) In applying this Subdivision in relation to the company in respect of a time after a notional alteration time, the notional alteration time is taken not to have occurred.

         * Note: For **_relevant equity interests_** and **_relevant debt interests_**, see sections 165115X and 165115Y.

##### 165115Q  Notional alteration time--disposal of interests in company earlier than 12 months before alteration time

     * (b) an entity that *disposed of an interest in the company (the **_later equity_**) or a debt (the **_later debt_**) at, or within 12 months before, the alteration time also disposed of an interest in the company (the **_earlier equity_**) or a debt (the **_earlier debt_**) at a time (the **_earlier disposal time_**) earlier than 12 months before the alteration time but not earlier than the commencement time; and

     * (c) the disposal of the later equity or later debt and the disposal of the earlier equity or earlier debt occurred as part of an *arrangement; and

##### 165115R  When company is a loss company at first or only alteration time in income year

    * Application

    * (1) The question whether a company is a **_loss company_** at the first or only alteration time in a particular income year is to be worked out in this way.

    * Assumed income year

    * (2) Assume that the period that started at the beginning of the income year and ended at the alteration time is an income year and apply paragraphs (3)(a), (b), (c) and (d) on that assumption.

    * What is a loss company

    * (3) The company is a **_loss company_** at the alteration time if:

     * (a) at the beginning of the income year it had a *tax loss or tax losses for an earlier income year or earlier income years; or

     * (b) at the beginning of the income year it had a *net capital loss or net capital losses for an earlier income year or earlier income years; or

     * (c) it has a tax loss for the income year, calculated as if the income year were a period for the purposes of Subdivision 165B; or

     * (d) it has a net capital loss for the income year, calculated as if the income year were a period for the purposes of Subdivision 165CB; or

     * (e) it has an adjusted unrealised loss at the alteration time.

         * Note: For **_adjusted unrealised loss_**, see section 165115U.

    * How losses are to be calculated

    * (4) In applying subsection (3):

     * (a) a *tax loss or *net capital loss that was taken into account in working out under this section whether the company was a *loss company at an alteration time in a previous income year is to be disregarded; and

     * (b) Subdivision 170D is to be disregarded.

    * Overall loss

    * (5) The sum of:

     * (a) the amount or amounts of any *tax loss or tax losses referred to in paragraph (3)(a); and

     * (b) the amount or amounts of any *net capital loss or net capital losses referred to in paragraph (3)(b); and

     * (c) the amount of any tax loss referred to in paragraph (3)(c); and

     * (d) the amount of any net capital loss referred to in paragraph (3)(d); and

     * (e) the amount of any adjusted unrealised loss referred to in paragraph (3)(e);

    * is the *loss company's **_overall loss_** at the alteration time.

         * Note: The loss company's overall loss is relevant for the purposes of subsections 165115ZB(3) and (6).

    * Certain losses to be disregarded

    * (6) A reference in a paragraph of subsection (3) and in the corresponding paragraph of subsection (5) to a particular loss is a reference only to a loss to the extent to which it represents an outlay or loss of any of the economic resources of the company.

         * Note: Where the income tax law allows, as all or part of a loss, an amount for the decline in value of a depreciating asset that exceeds the actual economic depreciation or depletion of the asset concerned, the excess is not to be regarded for the purposes of this subsection as representing an outlay or loss of economic resources of the company.

    * (6A) Subsection (6) does not apply to paragraphs (3)(e) and (5)(e) if the company has chosen to use the *global method of working out whether it has an adjusted unrealised loss at the alteration time.

    * Amounts of losses may be reduced

    * (7) The amounts referred to in paragraphs (5)(a) to (d) may be reduced under section 165115T.

##### 165115S  When company is a loss company at second or later alteration time in income year

    * Application

    * (1) The question whether a company is a **_loss company_** at an alteration time (the **_current alteration time_**) that is the second or a later alteration time in the same income year is to be worked out in this way.

    * Assumed income year

    * (2) Assume that the period that started immediately after the last alteration time and ended at the current alteration time is an income year and apply paragraphs (3)(a) and (b) on that assumption.

    * What is a loss company

    * (3) The company is a **_loss company_** at the current alteration time if:

     * (a) it has a *tax loss for the income year, calculated as if the income year were a period for the purposes of Subdivision 165B; or

     * (b) it has a *net capital loss for the income year, calculated as if the income year were a period for the purposes of Subdivision 165CB; or

     * (c) it has an adjusted unrealised loss at the current alteration time.

         * Note: For **_adjusted unrealised loss_**, see section 165115U.

    * How losses are to be calculated

    * (4) In applying subsection (3), Subdivision 170D is to be disregarded.

    * Overall loss

    * (5) The sum of:

     * (a) the amount of any *tax loss referred to in paragraph (3)(a); and

     * (b) the amount of any *net capital loss referred to in paragraph (3)(b); and

     * (c) the amount of any adjusted unrealised loss referred to in paragraph (3)(c);

    * is the *loss company's **_overall loss_** at the current alteration time.

         * Note: The loss company's overall loss is relevant for the purposes of subsections 165115ZB(3) and (6).

    * Certain losses to be disregarded

    * (6) A reference in a paragraph of subsection (3) and in the corresponding paragraph of subsection (5) to a particular loss is a reference only to a loss to the extent to which it represents an outlay or loss of any of the economic resources of the company.

         * Note: Where the income tax law allows, as all or part of a loss, an amount for the decline in value of a depreciating asset that exceeds the actual economic depreciation or depletion of the asset concerned, the excess is not to be regarded for the purposes of this subsection as representing an outlay or loss of economic resources of the company.

    * (6A) Subsection (6) does not apply to paragraphs (3)(c) and (5)(c) if the company has chosen to use the *global method of working out whether it has an adjusted unrealised loss at the current alteration time.

    * Amounts of losses may be reduced

    * (7) The amounts referred to in paragraphs (5)(a) and (b) may be reduced under section 165115T.

##### 165115T  Reduction of certain amounts included in company's overall loss at alteration time

    * (1) In working out under section 165115R or 165115S whether a company was a *loss company at an alteration time (the **_current alteration time_**), if a loss (the **_realised loss_**) referred to in paragraph 165115R(3)(a), (b), (c) or (d) or 165115S(3)(a) or (b) that the company had at the current alteration time reflected an amount of a notional revenue loss, a trading stock decrease or a notional capital loss included in an adjusted unrealised loss, that the company had at a previous alteration time, the realised loss is taken to be reduced by that amount.

         * Note 1: For **_notional revenue loss_** and **_notional capital loss_** see section 165115V.

         * Note 2: For **_trading stock decrease_** see section 165115W.

    * (2) Subsection (1) does not apply to an adjusted unrealised loss that the company had at a previous alteration time if the company has chosen to use the *global method of working out whether it has an adjusted unrealised loss at that previous time.

##### 165115U  Adjusted unrealised loss

    * (1) The question whether a company has an **_adjusted unrealised loss_** at an alteration time (the **_relevant alteration time_**) is worked out in this way (the **_individual asset method_**), unless the company chooses to work it out using the *global method (set out in subsection (1B)).

Method statement

       * Step 1.	Work out under section 165115V or 165115W in respect of each *CGT asset that the company owned at the relevant alteration time any notional capital loss, notional revenue loss or trading stock decrease that the company has at that time in respect of the asset.

       * To the extent that a notional capital loss or a notional revenue loss in respect of an asset at the relevant alteration time reflected an amount that was counted at an earlier alteration time, do not count it again at the relevant alteration time.

       * Step 2.	Add up the notional capital losses and the notional revenue losses that the company had at the relevant alteration time. The total is the company's **_nominal unrealised loss_** at that time.

       * Step 3.	Add up the trading stock decreases that the company had at the relevant alteration time. The total is the company's **_overall trading stock decrease_** at that time.

       * Step 4.	The sum of the company's nominal unrealised loss and overall trading stock decrease at the relevant time is the company's **_adjusted unrealised loss_** at that time.

         * Note: Certain alteration times are disregarded (see subsections 165115K(2) and (4)).

    * (1A) Step 1 in the method statement in subsection (1) does not apply to an amount that was counted at an earlier alteration time if the company has chosen to use the *global method of working out whether it has an adjusted unrealised loss at that earlier time.

    * (1B) The **_global method_** of working out whether the company has an **_adjusted unrealised loss_** at the relevant alteration time is as follows:

Method statement

       * Step 1.	Work out the total *market value of all *CGT assets that the company owned at the relevant alteration time (including those it *acquired for less than $10,000), using a valuation method that would generally be regarded as appropriate in the circumstances.

       * Step 2.	Work out the total of the *cost bases of those *CGT assets at the relevant time.

            * Note: If a CGT asset that the company owned at the relevant time was also trading stock or a revenue asset at that time, see subsection (1C) of this section.

       * Step 3.	If the step 2 amount exceeds the step 1 amount, the excess is the company's **_adjusted unrealised loss_** at the relevant time.

    * (1C) If:

     * (a) a *CGT asset that the company owned at the relevant alteration time was also *trading stock or a *revenue asset at that time; and

     * (b) the asset's *cost base at the relevant alteration time is _less than_ the amount that, if the relevant alteration time were a changeover time, would be compared under section 165115F with the asset's *market value in working out a notional revenue gain or notional revenue loss that the company would have at the changeover time in respect of the asset;

    * then, for the purposes of step 2 of the method statement in subsection (1B) of this section, the amount that would be so compared is to be taken into account _instead of_ that cost base.

    * (1D) A choice to use the *global method must be made on or before:

     * (a) the day on which the company lodges its *income tax return for the income year in which the relevant alteration time occurred; or

     * (b) such later day as the Commissioner allows.

    * (2) However, the company does not have an adjusted unrealised loss at the relevant alteration time if the company would, at that time, satisfy the maximum net asset value test under section 15215.

##### 165115V  Notional losses

    * (1) This section applies for the purpose of calculating whether a company has at an alteration time a notional capital loss or a notional revenue loss in respect of a *CGT asset that it owned at that time.

    * (2) However, a company does not have a notional capital loss or a notional revenue loss at an alteration time in respect of a CGT asset that it *acquired for less than $10,000.

    * (3) The calculation is to be made on the assumption that the company disposed of the asset at its *market value at the alteration time.

    * (4) If the company would make a *capital loss in respect of the disposal of the asset, the company has at the alteration time in respect of the asset a **_notional capital loss_** equal to the amount of the capital loss.

    * (5) If the company would be entitled to a deduction in respect of the disposal of the asset, the company has at the alteration time in respect of the asset a **_notional revenue loss_** equal to the amount of the deduction.

    * (6) A company may choose that this section is to apply to the company at the alteration time in respect of an asset to which subsection (7) applied at that time as if the reference in subsection (3) to the *market value of the asset were a reference to its *written down value.

    * (7) This subsection applies to an asset at the alteration time if:

     * (a) the asset is a *depreciating asset (not a building or structure) for whose decline in value the company has deducted or can deduct an amount; and

     * (b) the expenditure incurred by the company to *acquire the asset was less than $1,000,000 (the expenditure can include the giving of property: see section 1035); and

     * (c) it would be reasonable for the company to conclude that the *market value of the asset at the alteration time was not less than 80% of its *written down value at that time.

##### 165115W  Calculation of trading stock decrease

    * (1) The question whether there is a **_trading stock decrease_** in relation to a company at an alteration time for a *CGT asset of the company that was an item of *trading stock at that time is worked out in this way.

Method statement

       * Step 1.	Work out whether the item's *market value immediately before the alteration time was less than:

         * (a) if there was no earlier alteration time in the income year in which that alteration time occurred--the item's value under subsection 7040(1) at the start of that income year or its cost if subsection 7040(2) applies; or

         * (b) if there was an earlier alteration time or there were earlier alteration times in that income year--the item's market value immediately before that earlier alteration time or the later or latest of those earlier alteration times, as the case may be, or its cost if the company did not own it at that time.

       * Step 2.	If the item's *market value immediately before the alteration time was less than:

         * (a) the item's value or cost referred to in paragraph (a) in step 1; or

         * (b) its market value or cost (as applicable) in paragraph (b) in step 1;

       * as the case requires, the difference is the **_trading stock decrease_** for the item.

       * To the extent (if any) to which the difference reflects an amount counted at an earlier alteration time, do not count that amount again.

         * Note: Certain alteration times are disregarded (see subsections 165115K(2) and (4)).

    * (1A) Step 2 in the method statement in subsection (1) does not apply to an amount counted at an earlier alteration time if the company has chosen to use the *global method of working out whether it has an adjusted unrealised loss at that earlier time.

    * (2) However, a company does not have a trading stock decrease at an alteration time in respect of an item of *trading stock that it *acquired for less than $10,000.

##### 165115X  Relevant equity interest

    * (1) An entity (not an individual) has a **_relevant equity interest_** in a *loss company at a particular time if:

     * (a) at that time the entity has a controlling stake in the loss company (see section 165115Z); and

     * (b) at that time the entity has an interest (an **_equity_**) that gives, or interests (each of which is also called an **_equity_**) that between them give, the entity:

       * (i) the control of, or the ability to control, 10% or more of the voting power in the loss company (either directly, or indirectly through one or more interposed entities); or

       * (ii) the right to receive (either directly, or indirectly through one or more interposed entities) 10% or more of any dividends that the loss company may pay; or

       * (iii) the right to receive (either directly, or indirectly through one or more interposed entities) 10% or more of any distribution of capital of the loss company; and

     * (c) the equity or each equity is either:

       * (i) an interest (including a *share or shares, or an option or right to acquire a share or shares) in the loss company; or

       * (ii) an interest (including an option or right to acquire an interest) held by the entity directly in another entity that has a relevant equity interest or relevant debt interest in the loss company.

    * (2) The equity or equities constitute the entity's relevant equity interest in the *loss company.

    * (2A) A *widely held company that, apart from this subsection, would have a relevant equity interest in a *loss company at a particular time does not have such an interest at that time.

    * (2B) Subsection (2A) does not apply if:

     * (a) an entity has a controlling stake in the loss company (see section 165115Z); and

     * (b) that entity has a direct or indirect interest in, or is owed a debt by, the *widely held company, being an interest or debt in respect of which:

       * (i) the entity could, if a *CGT event happened in respect of the interest or debt, make a *capital loss (other than a capital loss that would be disregarded) that reflects any part of the loss company's overall loss; or

       * (ii) the entity has deducted or can deduct, or could deduct at a later time, an amount in respect of the cost of the *acquisition, or a net loss on the *disposal, of the interest or debt, where the deduction reflected or would have reflected, or would reflect, as the case may be, any part of the company's overall loss.

    * (2C) Subsection (2A) does not apply in respect of a particular time if an entity that had a direct or indirect interest in, or was owed a debt by, the *widely held company at an earlier time, and had a controlling stake in the loss company (see section 165115Z) at the earlier time:

     * (a) made a capital loss (other than a capital loss that was disregarded) because a *CGT event happened in respect of the interest or debt, where the capital loss reflected any part of the *loss company's overall loss; or

     * (b) has deducted or could have deducted at an earlier time, or could deduct at a later time, an amount in respect of the cost of the *acquisition, or a net loss on the *disposal, of the interest or debt, where the deduction reflected or would have reflected, or would reflect, as the case may be, any part of the company's overall loss.

    * (3) An entity (the **_first entity_**) that, apart from this subsection, would have a relevant equity interest in a *loss company at a particular time does not have such an interest if, at that time, there is no other entity that has a direct or indirect interest in, or is owed a debt by, the first entity, being an interest or debt in respect of which:

     * (a) the other entity could, if a *CGT event happened in respect of the interest or debt, make a *capital loss (other than a capital loss that would be disregarded) that reflects any part of the loss company's overall loss; or

     * (b) the other entity has deducted or can deduct, or could deduct at a later time:

       * (i) an amount in respect of the cost of the *acquisition of the interest or debt; or

       * (ii) a net loss on the *disposal of the interest or debt;

     * where the deduction reflected, or would reflect, any part of the loss company's overall loss.

    * (3A) Subsection (3) does not apply if the first entity is a *widely held company.

    * (4) Subsection (3) does not apply to the first entity in respect of a particular time if an entity that had a direct or indirect interest in, or was owed a debt by, the first entity at an earlier time:

     * (a) made a capital loss (other than a capital loss that was disregarded) because a *CGT event happened in respect of the interest or debt, where the capital loss reflected any part of the *loss company's overall loss; or

     * (b) has deducted or could have deducted at an earlier time, or could deduct at a later time, an amount in respect of the cost of the *acquisition, or a net loss on the *disposal, of the interest or debt, where the deduction reflected or would have reflected, or would reflect, as the case may be, any part of the company's overall loss.

    * (5) An individual is not taken to have a **_relevant equity interest_** in a *loss company at any time.

    * (6) A partnership that consists only of individuals is not taken to have a **_relevant equity interest_** in a *loss company at any time.

    * (7) If section 10630, 10650 or 10660 would treat an act referred to in that section that is done in relation to an interest as having been done by an individual, the interest is not a relevant equity interest.

##### 165115Y  Relevant debt interest

    * (1) An entity (not an individual) has a **_relevant debt interest_** in a *loss company at a particular time if, at that time:

     * (a) the entity has a controlling stake in the loss company (see section 165115Z); and

     * (b) the entity is owed by the loss company a debt of not less than $10,000 (a **_debt_**) or debts at least one of which is not less than $10,000 (each debt of not less than $10,000 is also called a **_debt_**).

    * (2) An entity (not an individual) also has a **_relevant debt interest_** in a *loss company at a particular time if, at that time:

     * (a) the entity has a controlling stake in the loss company; and

     * (b) the entity is owed by an entity (the **_debtor entity_**) other than the loss company a debt of not less than $10,000 (also a **_debt_**) or debts at least one of which is not less than $10,000 (each debt of not less than $10,000 is also called a **_debt_**); and

     * (c) the debtor entity has a relevant equity interest or a relevant debt interest in the loss company.

    * (3) The total of the debts referred to in subsections (1) and (2) constitutes the entity's relevant debt interest in the *loss company.

    * (3A) A *widely held company that, apart from this subsection, would have a relevant debt interest in a *loss company at a particular time does not have such an interest at that time.

    * (3B) Subsection (3A) does not apply if:

     * (a) an entity has a controlling stake in the loss company (see section 165115Z); and

     * (b) that entity has a direct or indirect interest in, or is owed a debt by, the *widely held company, being an interest or debt in respect of which:

       * (i) the entity could, if a *CGT event happened in respect of the interest or debt, make a *capital loss (other than a capital loss that would be disregarded) that reflects any part of the loss company's overall loss; or

       * (ii) the entity has deducted or can deduct, or could deduct at a later time, an amount in respect of the cost of the *acquisition, or a net loss on the *disposal, of the interest or debt, where the deduction reflected or would have reflected, or would reflect, as the case may be, any part of the company's overall loss.

    * (3C) Subsection (3A) does not apply in respect of a particular time if an entity that had a direct or indirect interest in, or was owed a debt by, the *widely held company at an earlier time, and had a controlling stake in the *loss company (see section 165115Z) at the earlier time:

     * (a) made a *capital loss (other than a capital loss that was disregarded) because a *CGT event happened in respect of the interest or debt, where the capital loss reflected any part of the loss company's overall loss; or

     * (b) has deducted or could have deducted at an earlier time, or could deduct at a later time, an amount in respect of the cost of the *acquisition, or a net loss on the *disposal, of the interest or debt, where the deduction reflected or would have reflected, or would reflect, as the case may be, any part of the company's overall loss.

    * (4) An entity (the **_first entity_**) that, apart from this subsection, would have a relevant debt interest in a *loss company at a particular time does not have such an interest if, at that time, there is no other entity that has a direct or indirect interest in, or is owed a debt by, the first entity, being an interest or debt in respect of which:

     * (a) the other entity could, if a *CGT event happened in respect of the interest or debt, make a *capital loss (other than a capital loss that would be disregarded) that reflects any part of the loss company's overall loss; or

     * (b) the other entity could deduct, or can deduct or could deduct at a later time:

       * (i) an amount in respect of the cost of the *acquisition of the interest or debt; or

       * (ii) a net loss on the *disposal of the interest or debt;

     * where the deduction reflects, or would have reflected, any part of the loss company's overall loss.

    * (4A) Subsection (4) does not apply if the first entity is a *widely held company.

    * (5) Subsection (4) does not apply to the first entity in respect of a particular time if an entity that had a direct or indirect interest in, or was owed a debt by, the first entity at an earlier time:

     * (a) made a capital loss (other than a capital loss that would be disregarded) at an earlier time because a *CGT event happened in respect of the interest or debt, where the capital loss reflected any part of the *loss company's overall loss; or

     * (b) has deducted or could have deducted at an earlier time, or could deduct at a later time, an amount in respect of the cost of the *acquisition, or a net loss on the *disposal, of the interest or debt, where the deduction reflected or would have reflected, or would reflect, as the case may be, any part of the company's overall loss.

    * (6) An individual is not taken to have a **_relevant debt interest_** in a *loss company at any time.

    * (7) A partnership that consists only of individuals is not taken to have a **_relevant debt interest_** in a *loss company at any time.

    * (8) If section 10630, 10650 or 10660 would treat an act referred to in that section that is done in relation to a debt as having been done by an individual, the debt is not a relevant debt interest.

##### 165115Z  What constitutes a controlling stake in a company

    * (1) An entity has a **_controlling stake in a company_** at a particular time if the entity, or the entity and the entity's *associates between them:

     * (a) are able at that time to exercise, or control the exercise of, more than 50% of the voting power in the company (either directly, or indirectly through one or more interposed entities); or

     * (b) have at that time the right to receive (either directly, or indirectly through one or more interposed entities) more than 50% of any dividends that the company may pay; or

     * (c) have at that time the right to receive (either directly, or indirectly through one or more interposed entities) more than 50% of any distribution of capital of the company.

         * Note: The effect of subsection (1) is that, if an entity has a controlling stake in a company, each associate of the entity also has a controlling stake in the company.

    * (2) If:

     * (a) apart from this subsection, an interest that gives an entity and its *associates (if any):

       * (i) the ability to exercise, or control the exercise of, any of the voting power in a company; or

       * (ii) the right to receive dividends that a company may pay; or

       * (iii) the right to receive a distribution of capital of a company;

     * would, in the application of paragraph (1)(a), (b) or (c), be counted more than once; and

     * (b) the interest is both direct and indirect;

    * only the direct interest is to be counted.

##### 165115ZA  Reductions and other consequences if entity has relevant equity interest or relevant debt interest in loss company immediately before alteration time

    * Application of section

    * (1) This section applies to an entity (an **_affected entity_**) that has a relevant equity interest or a relevant debt interest, or both, in a *loss company immediately before a time (a **_relevant time_**) that is an alteration time in respect of the loss company.

         * Note: This section and section 165115ZB can apply differently for a company that has used the global method of working out whether it has an adjusted unrealised loss at an alteration time. See section 165115ZD.

    * Application of section nullified in certain circumstances

    * (2) However, if:

     * (a) this section has applied to an entity in respect of a debt owed to the entity; and

     * (b) Subdivisions 245C to 245G (which relate to the forgiveness of commercial debts) also applied in respect of the debt at the same time or at a later time;

    * any reductions or other consequences affecting the entity in respect of the debt under this section are taken not to have occurred or to have been required to occur.

         * Note: An amendment of an assessment can be made at any time to give effect to this subsection (see subsection 170(10AA) of the _Income Tax Assessment Act 1936_).

    * Reduction of reduced cost base

    * (3) The *reduced cost base of an equity or debt that was *acquired on or after 20 September 1985 is to be reduced immediately before the relevant time by the adjustment amount calculated under section 165115ZB.

    * Reduction of deduction--equity or debt is not trading stock

    * (4) If an equity or debt is not an item of *trading stock of the affected entity immediately before the relevant time, any amount that the entity can deduct in respect of the disposal of any of the equity or debt is to be reduced by the adjustment amount calculated under section 165115ZB.

    * Reduction of cost--equity or debt is trading stock

    * (5) If:

     * (a) an equity or debt is an item of *trading stock of the affected entity immediately before the relevant time; and

     * (b) the *cost for the purposes of Division 70 of the equity or debt exceeds its *market value immediately before the relevant time;

    * then, subject to any later application or applications of this Subdivision, the cost of the equity or debt for the purposes of Division 70, and any deduction for an outlay to *acquire it, are reduced by the lesser of the following amounts or, if they are equal, by one of them:

     * (c) the adjustment amount calculated under section 165115ZB;

     * (d) the amount of the excess referred to in paragraph (b).

    * Subsection (4) to apply only in respect of certain income years

    * (6) For the purpose of working out:

     * (a) deductions under section 81; or

     * (b) whether an amount is included in assessable income under subsection 7035(2); or

     * (c) whether an amount can be deducted under subsection 7035(3);

    * subsection (5) applies only in respect of income years ending after the later of the following:

     * (d) the commencement time;

     * (e) the time 12 months before the relevant time.

    * Further election to value trading stock

    * (7) If an election has been made under section 7045 to value an item of *trading stock on hand at the end of an income year otherwise than at its *cost and subsection (5) applies in respect of it, a further election may be made under that section to value the item of trading stock at cost.

    * Previous applications of this section in relation to trading stock to be taken into account

    * (8) In applying this section to the affected entity in respect of an equity or debt that is *trading stock of the entity, any previous applications of this section to the entity in respect of the equity or debt are to be taken into account.

    * Cost of equity or debt that becomes trading stock after relevant time

    * (9) If:

     * (a) an equity or debt becomes an item of *trading stock of the affected entity after the relevant time; and

     * (b) had the equity or debt been an item of trading stock of the affected entity at an earlier time that was, or at 2 or more earlier times each of which was, the relevant time for the purposes of a previous application or previous applications of this section, its *cost for the purposes of Division 70 would have exceeded its *market value at the earlier time or at one of the earlier times;

    * its cost for the purposes of Division 70 is taken to be its market value at the earlier time or the smallest of its market values at the earlier times.

    * Reduction of proceeds of disposal of trading stock

    * (10) If:

     * (a) an equity or debt was an item of *trading stock of the affected entity immediately before a relevant time or became such an item of trading stock after a relevant time; and

     * (b) the equity or debt is *disposed of by the entity after the relevant time concerned; and

     * (c) the equity or debt is an item of trading stock of the affected entity at the time of the disposal; and

     * (d) the proceeds of the disposal exceed the *market value of the equity or debt immediately before the relevant time concerned or the market value of the equity or debt immediately before any previous relevant time;

    * the proceeds of the disposal are taken to be reduced by so much of the amount or the total of the amounts of any reductions made by any previous application or applications of subsection (5) in relation to the affected entity in respect of the equity or debt as does not exceed the excess amount or the greater or greatest of the excess amounts referred to in paragraph (d).

##### 165115ZB  Adjustment amounts for the purposes of section 165115ZA

    * (1A) This section has effect for the purposes of:

     * (a) section 165115ZA; and

     * (b) sections 715255 and 715270 (about effect of alteration time for head company on membership interests of leaving entity just before leaving time).

    * Calculation of adjustment amount

    * (1) An adjustment amount in relation to an equity or debt is to be worked out by the affected entity, and applied by it in making reductions:

     * (a) if subsection (2) applies--in accordance with subsection (3); or

     * (b) otherwise--in accordance with subsection (6).

    * Selection of method of calculation

    * (2) This subsection applies if:

     * (a) the affected entity has a relevant equity interest, but does not have a relevant debt interest, in the *loss company immediately before the alteration time and:

       * (i) all the *shares in the loss company are of the same class and have the same *market value; and

       * (ii) the equity consists only of a share or shares in the loss company; or

     * (b) the affected entity has both a relevant equity interest, and a relevant debt interest under subsection 165115Y(1), in the loss company immediately before the alteration time and:

       * (i) all the shares in the loss company are of the same class and have the same market value; and

       * (ii) the equity consists only of a share or shares in the loss company; and

       * (iii) the debt consists of a single debt or 2 or more debts of the same kind;

    * and the reductions that would result from the application of subsection (3) would be reasonable in the circumstances.

    * Formula method

    * (3) The **_adjustment amount_** to be worked out under this subsection is the amount worked out using the formula:

    * and the amount so worked out is to be applied in making reductions as follows: 

     * (a) the adjustment amount is to be applied in relation to the *share or shares constituting the equity; and

     * (b) if there is an amount remaining after making reductions in relation to those shares--the amount remaining is to be applied in relation to any debt or, if there is a debt consisting of 2 or more separate debts, in relation to those debts.

    * Applying adjustment amount under formula method to shares

    * (4) If the adjustment amount referred to in subsection (3) is to be applied in relation to an equity consisting of 2 or more *shares:

     * (a) it is to be applied equally among the shares; and

     * (b) if there is any amount remaining after the application of part of the adjustment amount to a share, the amount remaining is to be applied to any other share, or equally among any other shares, to the maximum extent possible.

    * Applying adjustment amount under formula method to debt

    * (5) If the adjustment amount referred to in subsection (3) or part of it is to be applied in relation to a debt (the **_overall debt_**) and the overall debt consists of 2 or more debts (the **_constituent debts_**), the amount to be applied in relation to each constituent debt is the amount worked out using the formula:

    * Nonformula method

    * (6) The **_adjustment amount_** to be worked out under this subsection is the amount that is appropriate having regard to:

     * (a) the object of this Subdivision and other matters set out in section 165115J; and

     * (b) the extent of the affected entity's relevant equity interests or relevant debt interests, as the case may be, in the *loss company immediately before the alteration time; and

     * (c) when, and under what circumstances, the relevant equity interests or relevant debt interests were *acquired by the affected entity; and

     * (d) the loss company's overall loss at the alteration time; and

     * (e) the extent to which that overall loss has reduced the *market values of the equity or debt; and

     * (f) to prevent double counting, the extent of any adjustments required under this Subdivision because of any application of this Subdivision to another loss company in which the affected entity has a relevant equity interest or relevant debt interest;

    * and the amount so worked out is to be applied in making reductions in an appropriate way.

    * How to work out the extent to which the overall loss has reduced the market value of an equity or debt

    * (7) To avoid doubt in applying paragraph (6)(e) in relation to an equity or a debt, if factors other than an overall loss altered the *market value of the equity or debt, the extent to which the overall loss reduced that market value is taken to be the extent to which that market value would have been reduced apart from those other factors.

         * Note 1: For a company's **_overall loss_** see subsections 165115R(5) and 165115S(5).

         * Note 2: An example of a factor other than the overall loss is the unrealised value of assets (including assets in respect of which there is an unrealised gain) of the loss company, whether or not generated by outlays or economic losses reflected in the loss for income tax purposes.

     * (b) any other matters that the Commissioner considers relevant.

    * Obligations of person not affected by failure to give notice

    * (8) Any failure by an entity or the *loss company to give a notice to a person under this section does not affect any obligation of the person to comply with the requirements of this Subdivision.

##### 165115ZD  Adjustment (or further adjustment) for interest realised at a loss after global method has been used

    * (1) This section affects how sections 165115ZA and 165115ZB apply to an interest (the **_equity_**) in, or a debt owed by, a company if, apart from this section, a loss (the **_realised loss_**):

     * (a) would be *realised for income tax purposes by a *realisation event that happens to the equity or debt; or

     * (b) would be so realised but for Subdivision 170D (which defers realisation of capital losses and deductions);

    * and the company chose to use the *global method of working out whether it had an adjusted unrealised loss at the last alteration time:

     * (c) that happened for the company before the realisation event; and

     * (d) immediately before which the equity or debt was, or was part of:

       * (i) if the company was a *loss company at that alteration time--a relevant equity interest, or a relevant debt interest, that an entity had in the company; or

       * (ii) otherwise--what would have been such an interest if the company had been a loss company at that alteration time.

         * Note: If that last alteration time is before the day on which the _New Business Tax System (Consolidation, Value Shifting, Demergers and Other Measures) Act 2002_ received the Royal Assent, the owner of the equity or debt may choose to apply section 165115ZD of the _Income Tax (Transitional Provisions) Act 1997_ instead of this section.

    * (2) In addition to any application to the equity or debt, in relation to that last alteration time, that sections 165115ZA and 165115ZB have apart from this section, those sections apply (and are taken always to have applied) to the equity or debt, in relation to that last alteration time, as if:

     * (a) the company had an adjusted unrealised loss at that time worked out under this section; and

     * (b) the company were therefore a *loss company at that time; and

     * (c) that adjusted unrealised loss were the company's overall loss at that time.

    * (3) For the purposes of how sections 165115ZA and 165115ZB apply because of this section, the adjustment amount under section 165115ZB is to be worked out and applied in accordance with subsection 165115ZB(6) (the nonformula method).

    * Adjusted unrealised loss worked out under this section

    * (4) The adjusted unrealised loss referred to in paragraph (2)(a) is worked out using this method statement:

Method statement

       * Step 1.	Add up the amount or value of each thing covered by subsection (5). (If the total exceeds the realised loss, reduce the total by the excess.)

       * Step 2.	Reduce the step 1 amount by so much of the realised loss as it is reasonable to conclude is attributable to _none_ of these:

         * (a) a notional capital loss, or a notional revenue loss, that the company has at that last alteration time in respect of a *CGT asset;

         * (b) a trading stock decrease in relation to that time for a CGT asset that was *trading stock of the company at that time.

         * Note: If the equity or debt is a revenue asset, the realised loss is different from the loss referred to in subsection (1): see subsection (9).

    * (5) This subsection covers each thing covered by an item in the table, except to the extent that:

     * (a) it is reasonable to conclude that the thing was _not_ attributable to value that is reflected in what would, if that last alteration time had been a *changeover time for the company, be a notional capital gain or notional revenue gain that the company had under section 165115F at that changeover time in respect of a *CGT asset; or

     * (b) the thing has resulted in a reduction of the *reduced cost base of the equity or debt.

    * (6) The period starts at that last alteration time and ends at the earlier of:

     * (a) the time of the *realisation event referred to in paragraph (1)(a); or

     * (b) the time immediately before the earliest time when the equity or debt is no longer, or is no longer part of:

       * (i) if the company was a *loss company at that last alteration time--a relevant equity interest, or a relevant debt interest, that an entity has in the company; or

       * (ii) otherwise--what would have been such an interest if the company had been a loss company at that last alteration time.

    * (7) For the purposes of item 6 of the table in subsection (5), the *capital proceeds of the *CGT event are to be worked out:

     * (a) under subsection 11620(1) only; and

     * (b) disregarding subsection 10310(1) and paragraph 10310(2)(a) (about entitlement to receive money or property).

    * Notices under section 165115ZC not affected

    * (8) To avoid doubt:

     * (a) a notice need not be given under section 165115ZC because of this section; and

     * (b) this section does not affect the requirements that apply to a notice that otherwise must be given under that section.

    * If equity or debt is a revenue asset

    * (9) If the equity or debt is a *revenue asset at the time of the *realisation event, subsection (4) applies on the basis that the realised loss is the total of:

     * (a) the loss (if any) *realised for income tax purposes by the realisation event happening to the equity or debt in its character as a *CGT asset; and

     * (b) the loss (if any) realised for income tax purposes by the realisation event happening to the equity or debt in its character as a revenue asset.

##### Subdivision 165C--Deducting bad debts

##### Guide to Subdivision 165C

##### 165117  What this Subdivision is about

    * A company cannot deduct a bad debt unless: 

         * (a) if the debt was incurred in an earlier income year--the company had the same owners and the same control throughout the period from the day on which the debt was incurred to the end of the income year in which it writes off the debt as bad; or

         * (b) if the debt was incurred in the current year--the company had the same owners and the same control during the income year both before and after the debt was incurred;

    * or, if there has been a change of ownership or control, the company satisfies the same business test by carrying on the same business, entering into no new kinds of transactions and conducting no new kinds of business.

##### Operative provisions

##### 165119  Application of Subdivision

    * This Subdivision applies to a debt only to the extent (if any) to which Subdivision 165CC does not apply in respect of the debt.

         * Note: Subdivision 165CC applies to certain capital losses or tax losses of a company to the extent to which the capital loss or tax loss does not exceed the company's unrealised net loss.

##### 165120  To deduct a bad debt

    * (1) A company cannot deduct a debt (or part of a debt) that it writes off as bad in the *current year unless:

     * (a) it meets the conditions in section 165123 (which is about the company maintaining the same owners); or

          * Note: See section 165230 for a special alternative to the condition in this paragraph.

     * (b) the Commissioner thinks it would be unreasonable to require the company to meet the conditions in that section, having regard to the entities that beneficially owned the shares in the company when (in the Commissioner's opinion) the debt (or part) became bad; or

     * (c) the company meets the condition in section 165126 (which is about the company satisfying the same business test).

         * Note 1: In the case of a widely held or eligible Division 166 company, Subdivision 166C modifies how this Subdivision applies, unless the company chooses otherwise.

         * Note 2: Normally bad debts are deductible under section 81 or 2535.

         * Note 3: Subdivisions 709D and 719I modify how this Subdivision operates in relation to a company that used to be a member of a consolidated group or MEC group and that writes off as bad a debt that used to be owed to a member of the group.

    * (2) The conditions in section 165123 or 165126 apply to different periods, depending on whether the debt was incurred in the *current year or an earlier income year:

    * (3) A company cannot deduct a debt (or part of a debt) that it writes off as bad on the last day of the *current year if the debt was also incurred on that day.

##### 165123  Company must maintain the same owners

    * Ownership test period

    * (1) In determining whether section 165120 prevents a company from deducting a debt or a part of a debt, the **_ownership test period_** is the period from the start of the *first continuity period to the end of the *second continuity period.

         * Note: See section 165255 for the rule about incomplete test periods.

    * Voting power

    * (2) There must be persons who had *more than 50% of the voting power in the company at all times during the *ownership test period.

         * Note: See section 165150 to work out who had more than 50% of the voting power.

    * Rights to dividends

    * (3) There must be persons who had rights to *more than 50% of the company's dividends at all times during the *ownership test period.

         * Note: See section 165155 to work out who had rights to more than 50% of the company's dividends.

    * Rights to capital distributions

    * (4) There must be persons who had rights to *more than 50% of the company's capital distributions at all times during the *ownership test period.

         * Note: See section 165160 to work out who had rights to more than 50% of the company's capital distributions.

    * When to apply the primary test

    * (5) To work out whether a condition in this section was satisfied at all times during the *ownership test period, apply the primary test for that condition unless subsection (6) requires the alternative test to be applied.

         * Note: For the primary test, see subsections 165150(1), 165155(1) and 165160(1).

    * When to apply the alternative test

    * (6) Apply the alternative test for that condition if one or more other companies beneficially owned *shares or interests in shares in the company at any time during the *ownership test period.

         * Note: For the alternative test, see subsections 165150(2), 165155(2) and 165160(2).

    * Conditions in subsections (2), (3) and (4) may be treated as having been satisfied in certain circumstances

    * (7) If any of the conditions in subsections (2), (3) and (4) have not been satisfied, those conditions are taken to have been satisfied if:

     * (a) they would have been satisfied except for the operation of section 165165; and

     * (b) the company has information from which it would be reasonable to conclude that less than 50% of the debt or of the part of a debt has been reflected in deductions, capital losses, or reduced assessable income, that occurred, or could occur in future, because of the happening of any *CGT event in relation to any *direct equity interests or *indirect equity interests in the company during the *ownership test period.

    * (7A) If the company is:

     * (a) a *nonprofit company; or

     * (b) a *mutual affiliate company; or

     * (c) a *mutual insurance company;

    * during the whole of the *ownership test period, the conditions in subsections (3) and (4) are taken to have been satisfied by the company.

    * Time of happening of CGT event

    * (8) The happening of any *CGT event in relation to a *direct equity interest or *indirect equity interest in the company that results in the failure of the company to satisfy a condition in subsection (2), (3) or (4) is taken, for the purposes of paragraph (7)(b), to have occurred during the *ownership test period.

##### 165126  Alternatively, the company must satisfy the same business test

    * (1) This section sets out the condition that a company must meet to be able to deduct a debt or part of a debt that it writes off as bad in the *current year if:

     * (a) either:

       * (i) the company fails to meet a condition in subsection 165123(2), (3) or (4); or

       * (ii) it is not practicable to show that the company meets the conditions in those subsections; and

     * (b) paragraph 165120(1)(b) (about the Commissioner thinking it is unreasonable to require the company to meet the conditions in section 165123) does not apply.

         * Note	Other provisions may treat the company as meeting, or failing to meet, the conditions in subsections 165123(2), (3) and (4).

    * (2) The company must satisfy the *same business test for the *second continuity period (the **_same business test period_**). Apply the test to the *business the company carried on immediately before the time (the **_test time_**) shown in the relevant item of the table.

         *  For the same business test: see Subdivision 165E.

##### 165129  Same people must control the voting power, or the company must satisfy the same business test

    * (1) Even if section 165120 does not prevent a company from deducting a bad debt (or part of one), it cannot deduct the bad debt (or that part of it) if:

     * (a) for some or all of the part of the *ownership test period that started at the end of the *first continuity period, a person controlled, or was able to control, the voting power in the company (whether directly, or indirectly through one or more interposed entities); and

     * (b) for some or all of the *first continuity period, that person did _not_ control, and was not _able_ to control, that voting power (directly, or indirectly in that way); and

     * (c) that person began to control, or became able to control, that voting power (directly, or indirectly in that way) for the purpose of:

       * (i) getting some benefit or advantage in relation to how this Act applies; or

       * (ii) getting such a benefit or advantage for someone else;

     * or for purposes including that purpose.

         * Note: A person can still control the voting power in a company that is in liquidation etc.: see section 165250.

    * (2) However, that person's control of the voting power, or ability to control it, does not prevent the company from deducting the bad debt (or that part of it) if the company satisfies the *same business test for the *second continuity period (the **_same business test period_**).

    * (3) Apply the *same business test to the *business that the company carried on immediately before the time (the **_test time_**) when the person began to control that voting power, or became able to control it.

         *  For the same business test: see Subdivision 165E.

##### 165132  When tax losses resulting from bad debts cannot be deducted

    * (1) If:

     * (a) a company can deduct a debt (or part of a debt) that it wrote off as bad in an income year; and

     * (b) because the company failed to meet a condition in section 165123 (about the company maintaining the same owners), it could not have deducted the debt (or part) apart from section 165126 (about the company satisfying the same business test); and

     * (c) the company wrote off the debt _after_ the *test time worked out under section 165126; and

     * (d) because of the deduction, the company has a *tax loss for that income year, or there was an increase in the amount of its *tax loss for that income year; and

     * (e) the company carried on a *business during that income year for the purpose, or for purposes including the purpose, of securing a deduction for the debt (or part) by relying on section 165126;

    * the company cannot deduct the *tax loss for a later income year, or cannot deduct it to the extent of the increase, unless it also satisfies the *same business test for the later income year (the **_same business test period_**).

    * (2) Apply the test to the *business that the company carried on immediately before the *test time worked out for section 165126.

         *  For the same business test: see Subdivision 165E.

##### Subdivision 165E--The same business test

##### 165210  The test

    * (1) A company satisfies the **_same business test_** if throughout the *same business test period it carries on the same *business as it carried on immediately before the *test time.

    * (2) However, the company does _not_ satisfy the *same business test if, at any time during the *same business test period, it *derives assessable income from:

     * (a) a *business of a kind that it did not carry on before the *test time; or 

     * (b) a transaction of a kind that it had not entered into in the course of its business operations before the *test time.

    * (3) The company also does _not_ satisfy the *same business test if, before the *test time, it:

     * (a) started to carry on a *business it had not previously carried on; or

     * (b) in the course of its business operations, entered into a transaction of a kind that it had not previously entered into;

    * and did so for the purpose, or for purposes including the purpose, of being taken to have carried on throughout the *same business test period the same business as it carried on immediately before the test time.

    * (4) So far as the *same business test is applied for the purpose of Subdivision 165B (which is about working out the taxable income and *tax loss for the income year of change of ownership or control), the company also does _not_ satisfy the test if, at any time during the *same business test period, it incurs expenditure:

     * (a) in carrying on a *business of a kind that it did not carry on before the *test time; or

     * (b) as a result of a transaction of a kind that it had not entered into in the course of its business operations before the test time.

##### 165212D  Restructure of MDOs etc.

    * (1) An *MDO does not fail to satisfy the *same business test merely because, before 1 July 2003:

     * (a) the MDO restructured the way it *provides medical indemnity cover; or

     * (b) the MDO ceased to provide medical indemnity cover;

    * in order to comply with the _Medical Indemnity (Prudential Supervision and Product Standards) Act 2003_.

    * (2) A *general insurance company which is an *associate of an *MDO does not fail to satisfy the *same business test merely because, before 1 July 2003:

     * (a) the MDO restructured the way it *provides medical indemnity cover; or

     * (b) the MDO ceased to provide medical indemnity cover;

    * in order to comply with the _Medical Indemnity (Prudential Supervision and Product Standards) Act 2003_.

##### 165212E  Entry history rule does not apply for the purposes of the same business test

    * For the purposes of the *same business test, if an entity (the **_joining entity_**) becomes a *subsidiary member of a *consolidated group or a *MEC group, section 7015 (the entry history rule) does not operate to take the *business of the *head company of the group to include the business of the joining entity before it became a *member of the group.

##### Guide to Division 166

##### 1661  What this Division is about

    * This Division modifies the way the rules in Division 165 apply to a widely held or eligible Division 166 company by making it easier for the company to apply the rules.

    * If the company has maintained the same owners as between certain points of time, it does not need to prove it has maintained the same owners throughout the periods in between.

    * In certain cases, special concessional tracing rules deem entities to hold voting, dividend or capital stakes in the company so that the company does not have to trace through to the ultimate beneficial owners of the stakes.

##### Subdivision 166AA--The object of this Division

##### 1663  The object of this Division

    * (1) The object of this Division is to make it easier for a *widely held company, or an *eligible Division 166 company, to apply the rules in Division 165 (because of the difficulty the company might have under that Division in actually tracing through to the ultimate beneficial owners of *voting stakes, *dividend stakes and *capital stakes in the company).

    * (2) This Division makes it easier to apply the rules in Division 165 by:

     * (a) making it unnecessary for the company to prove that it has maintained the same owners throughout a period, if the company had the same owners at certain test times; and

     * (b) making it unnecessary for the company to trace through to the ultimate beneficial owners of:

       * (i) *voting stakes, *dividend stakes and *capital stakes in the company held by certain entities (whether directly, or *indirectly through one or more interposed entities); and

       * (ii) small voting stakes, dividend stakes and capital stakes in the company.

##### 1665  How Subdivision 165A applies to a widely held or eligible Division 166 company

    * (1) This Subdivision modifies the way Subdivision 165A applies to a company that is:

     * (a) a *widely held company at all times during the income year; or

     * (b) an *eligible Division 166 company at all times during the income year; or

     * (c) a widely held company for a part of the income year and an eligible Division 166 company for the rest of the income year.

         * Note 1: Subdivision 165A is about the conditions a company must meet before it can deduct a tax loss for an earlier income year.

         * Note 2: A company can choose that this Subdivision is not to apply to it: see section 16615.

         * Note 3: See section 165255 for the rule about incomplete income years.

    * Meaning of **test period**

    * **	(2)	The company's **_test period_** is the period consisting of the *loss year, the income year and any intervening period.

         * Note: See section 165255 for the rule about incomplete test periods.

    * Substantial continuity of ownership

    * (3) The company is taken to have met the conditions in section 16512 (which is about the company maintaining the same owners) if there is *substantial continuity of ownership of the company as between the start of the *test period and:

     * (a) the end of each income year in that period; and

     * (b) the *end of each *corporate change in that period.

         * Note: See sections 166145 and 166175 to work out whether there is substantial continuity of ownership and a corporate change.

    * No substantial continuity of ownership

    * (4) The company is taken to have _failed_ to meet the conditions in section 16512 if there is _no _*substantial continuity of ownership of the company as between the start of the *test period and:

     * (a) the end of an income year in that period; or

     * (b) the *end of a *corporate change in that period.

    * Satisfies the same business test

    * (5) However, if the company satisfies the *same business test for the income year (the **_same business test period_**), it is taken to have satisfied the condition in section 16513.

         * Note 1: For the same business test, see Subdivision 165E.

         * Note 2: See section 165255 for the rule about incomplete test periods.

    * (6) Apply the *same business test to the *business that the company carried on immediately before the earlier of the following times (the **_test time_**):

     * (a) the end of the first income year;

     * (b) the first time in the test period that a *corporate change in the company *ends;

    * for which there is no *substantial continuity of ownership of the company as between the start of the *test period and that time.

##### 16620  How Subdivisions 165B and 165CB apply to a widely held or eligible Division 166 company

    * (1) This Subdivision modifies how Subdivisions 165B and 165CB apply to a company that is:

     * (a) a *widely held company at all times during the income year (the **_test period_**); or

     * (b) an *eligible Division 166 company at all times during the income year (the **_test period_**); or

     * (c) a widely held company for a part of the income year and an eligible Division 166 company for the rest of the income year (the whole year being the **_test period_**).

         * Note 1: Subdivision 165B is about when a company must calculate its taxable income and tax loss for the income year in a special way. Subdivision 165CB is about when a company must calculate its net capital gain and net capital loss for the income year in a special way.

         * Note 2: A company can choose that this Subdivision is not to apply to it: see section 16635.

         * Note 3: See section 165255 for the rule about incomplete test periods.

    * No corporate change etc.

    * (2) If:

     * (a) _no _*corporate change in the company *ends at any time in the *test period; or

     * (b) a corporate change in the company *ends during the test period, but there is *substantial continuity of ownership as between the start of the test period and immediately after the corporate change ends;

    * the company is taken to have met the condition in paragraph 16535(a) (which is about there being persons having *more than a 50% stake in it during the whole of the income year).

         * Note: See sections 166145 and 166175 to work out whether there is substantial continuity of ownership and a corporate change.

    * Corporate change

    * (3) If:

     * (a) a *corporate change in the company *ends at any time in the *test period; and

     * (b) there is no *substantial continuity of ownership as between the start of the test period and immediately after the corporate change ends;

    * then the company is taken to have _failed_ to meet the condition in paragraph 16535(a).

    * Satisfies the same business test

    * (4) However, if the company satisfies the *same business test for the rest of the income year (the **_same business test period_**) after the first time (the **_test time_**) in the *test period that a *corporate change in the company *ended, the company is taken to have satisfied the condition in paragraph 16535(b).

         * Note 1: For the same business test, see Subdivision 165E.

         * Note 2: See section 165255 for the rule about incomplete test periods.

    * (5) Apply the *same business test to the *business that the company carried on immediately before the *test time.

##### 16625  How to work out the taxable income, tax loss, net capital gain and net capital loss

    * (1) If the company must calculate its taxable income and *tax loss for the income year under Subdivision 165B, and its *net capital gain and *net capital loss under Subdivision 165CB, then, in dividing the income year into periods, apply subsection (2) of this section instead of subsection 16545(3).

    * (2) The last period ends at the end of the income year. Each period (except the last) ends at the _earlier_ of:

     * (a) the _earliest_ time when:

       * (i) a *corporate change in the company *ends; and

       * (ii) there is no *substantial continuity of ownership of the company as between the start of the *test period and that time; or

     * (b) the _earliest_ time when a person begins to control, or becomes able to control, the voting power in the company (whether directly, or indirectly through one or more interposed entities) for the purpose, or for purposes including the purpose, of:

       * (i) getting some benefit or advantage to do with how this Act applies; or

       * (ii) getting such a benefit or advantage for someone else.

         * Note: See sections 166145 and 166175 to work out whether there is substantial continuity of ownership and a corporate change.

     * (a) a *widely held company at all times during the income year; or

     * (b) an *eligible Division 166 company at all times during the income year; or

     * (c) a widely held company for a part of the income year and an eligible Division 166 company for the rest of the income year.

         * Note: See section 165255 for the rule about incomplete income years.

##### Stakes of less than 10% in the tested company

##### 166225  Direct stakes of less than 10% in the tested company

    * (1) This section modifies how the ownership tests in section 166145 are applied to the tested company if:

     * (a) a *voting stake that carries rights to less than 10% of the voting power in the company is held directly in the company; or

     * (b) a *dividend stake that carries the right to receive less than 10% of any dividends that the company may pay is held directly in the company; or

     * (c) a *capital stake that carries the right to receive less than 10% of any distribution of capital of the company is held directly in the company.

         * Note: Other rules might affect this provision: see sections 166270, 166275 and 166280.

    * Notional shareholder

    * (2) The tests are applied to the tested company as if, at the *ownership test time, a single notional entity:

     * (a) directly controlled the voting power that is carried by each such *voting stake; and

     * (b) had the right to receive, for its own benefit and directly:

       * (i) any *dividends the tested company may pay in respect of each such *dividend stake; and

       * (ii) any distributions of capital of the tested company in respect of each such *capital stake; and

     * (c) were a person (other than a company).

         * Note: The persons who actually control the voting power and have rights to dividends and capital are taken not to control that power or have those rights: see section 166265.

    * (3) To avoid doubt, the single notional entity mentioned in subsection (2) is a different single notional entity from the one mentioned in section 165207 and the one mentioned in section 166255.

##### 166230  Indirect stakes of less than 10% in the tested company

    * (1) This section modifies how the ownership tests in section 166145 are applied to the tested company if it is the case, or it is reasonable to assume that:

     * (a) an entity (the **_stakeholder_**) indirectly holds any of these stakes in the tested company:

       * (i) a *voting stake that carries rights to less than 10% of the voting power in the company; or

       * (ii) a *dividend stake that carries the right to receive less than 10% of any dividends that the company may pay; or

       * (iii) a *capital stake that carries the right to receive less than 10% of any distribution of capital of the company; and

     * (b) either:

       * (i) the stakeholder indirectly holds the stake in the tested company by holding *shares directly in a company (the **_top interposed entity_**) that is interposed between the stakeholder and the tested company; or

       * (ii) the stakeholder indirectly holds the stake in the tested company by holding another interest directly in an entity (the **_top interposed entity_**) that is not a company and that is interposed between the stakeholder and the tested company.

         * Note 1: There might also be other entities interposed between the top interposed entity and the tested company.

         * Note 2: Other rules might affect this provision: see subsection (3) and sections 166272, 166275 and 166280.

    * Top interposed entity deemed to hold stakes directly in the tested company

    * (2) The tests are applied to the tested company as if, at the *ownership test time:

     * (a) if the stake is a *voting stake--the top interposed entity controls, or is able to control, the voting power in the tested company that is carried by that stake at that time; and

     * (b) if the stake is a *dividend stake--the top interposed entity *indirectly had the right to receive, for its own benefit, any *dividends the tested company may pay in respect of that stake at that time; and

     * (c) if the stake is a *capital stake--the top interposed entity indirectly had the right to receive, for its own benefit, any distributions of capital of the tested company in respect of that stake at that time; and

     * (d) in any case--the top interposed entity were a person (other than a company).

         * Note: The persons who actually control the voting power and have rights to dividends and capital are taken not to control that power or have those rights: see section 166265.

    * Acquisition of top interposed entity by another entity

    * (3) If:

     * (a) a new entity (the **_new interposed entity_**) acquires all the *shares or other interests in the top interposed entity (the **_old interposed entity_**); and

     * (b) the new interposed entity has the same classes of shares or other interests as the old interposed entity; and

     * (c) if the new interposed entity is a company--the shares are not *redeemable shares; and

     * (d) in any case--each stakeholder holds the same proportion of the total *voting stakes, *dividend stakes or *capital stakes in the new interposed entity immediately after the acquisition as the stakeholder held in the old interposed entity immediately before the acquisition;

    * then, at all times that the old interposed entity held or is taken to have held a stake in the tested company, the new interposed entity is taken to have held that stake.

    * (4) Except for the purposes of determining whether a time is an alteration time (within the meaning of section 165115L), section 166272 (which is about the same shares or interests) is to be disregarded when applying subsection (3).

##### Stakes held directly and/or indirectly by widely held companies

##### 166240  Stakes held directly and/or indirectly by widely held companies

    * (1) This section modifies how the ownership tests in section 166145 are applied to the tested company if a *widely held company directly or indirectly (through one or more interposed entities), or both directly and indirectly, holds any of the following:

     * (a) a *voting stake that carries rights to between 10% and 50% (inclusive) of the voting power in the company;

         * Note: Other rules might affect this provision: see subsections (3) and (4) and sections 166272, 166275 and 166280.

    * (2) The tests are applied to the tested company as if, at the *ownership test time:

     * (a) if the stake is a *voting stake--the *widely held company controls, or is able to control, the voting power in the tested company that is carried by that stake at that time; and

     * (d) the new company has the same classes of shares (not being *redeemable shares) as the widely held company; and

     * (e) each entity that held stakes in the widely held company immediately before the acquisition holds the same proportion of the total *voting stakes, *dividend stakes or *capital stakes in the new company immediately after the acquisition as the entity held in the widely held company immediately before the acquisition;

    * then, at all times that the widely held company held or is taken to have held a stake in the tested company, the new company is taken to have held that stake.

    * (5) Except for the purposes of determining whether a time is an alteration time (within the meaning of section 165115L), section 166272 (which is about same shares or interests) is to be disregarded when applying subsection (4).

##### When identity of foreign stakeholders is not known

##### 166255  Bearer shares in foreign listed companies

    * (1) This section modifies how the ownership tests in section 166145 are applied to the tested company if:

     * (a) at the *ownership test time, it is the case, or it is reasonable to assume, that persons (none of them companies or trustees) hold a *voting stake, a *dividend stake or a *capital stake in the tested company; and

     * (b) an entity has not, under section 166225, 166230, 166240 or 166245, been taken to control voting power or have rights in respect of the stake; and

     * (c) another company (the **_foreign listed company_**) is interposed, at that time, between those persons and the tested company; and

     * (d) at all times during the income year of the tested company in which the ownership test time occurs, the *principal class of shares in the foreign listed company is listed for quotation in the official list of an *approved stock exchange; and

     * (e) at the ownership test time:

       * (i) voting stakes that carry rights to 50% or more of the voting power in the foreign listed company; or

       * (ii) dividend stakes that carry rights to receive 50% or more of any dividends that the foreign listed company may pay; or

       * (iii) capital stakes that carry rights to receive 50% or more of any distribution of capital of the foreign listed company;

     * as the case requires, are directly held by way of bearer shares; and

     * (f) the beneficial owners of some or all of those bearer shares have not been disclosed to the foreign listed company.

         * Note 1: See section 165255 for the rule about incomplete test periods.

         * Note 2: Other rules might affect this provision: see sections 166270, 166275 and 166280.

    * (2) The tests are applied to the tested company as if, at the *ownership test time, for each of those bearer shares whose owners have not been disclosed:

     * (a) a single notional entity controls, or is able to control, the voting power in the tested company that is carried by those shares at that time; and

     * (b) the entity *indirectly had the right to receive, for its own benefit:

##### 166260  Depository entities holding stakes in foreign listed companies

    * (1) This section modifies how the ownership tests in section 166145 are applied to the tested company if:

     * (b) an entity has not, under section 166225, 166230, 166240, 166245 or 166255, been taken to control voting power or have rights in respect of the stake; and

     * (c) another company (the **_foreign listed company_**) is interposed, at that time, between those persons and the tested company; and

       * (iii) capital stakes that carry rights to receive 50% or more of any distribution of capital of the foreign listed company;

     * as the case requires, are directly held by one or more *depository entities (see subsection (3)); and

     * (f) a law of a foreign country, or a part of a foreign country, in which the approved stock exchange is located, prevents the disclosure of the beneficial owners of some or all of those shares that are held by the depository entities; and

     * (g) the beneficial owners of some or all of the shares held by the depository entities have not been disclosed to the foreign listed company.

         * Note 1: See section 165255 for the rule about incomplete test periods.

         * Note 2: This rule might not apply in all circumstances: see sections 166275 and 166280.

    * (2) The tests are applied to the tested company as if, at the *ownership test time, for each of those *shares held by a *depository entity whose owners have not been disclosed, the depository entity:

     * (a) controls, or is able to control, the voting power in the tested company that is carried by those shares at that time; and

     * (b) *indirectly had the right to receive, for its own benefit:

       * (i) any *dividends the tested company may pay in respect of those shares at that time; and

       * (ii) any distributions of capital of the tested company in respect of those shares at that time; and

     * (c) were a person (other than a company).

         * Note: The persons who actually control the voting power and have rights to dividends and capital are taken not to control that power or have those rights: see section 166265.

    * (3) If the effect of subsection (2) is that the *depository entity is taken to hold:

     * (a) a *voting stake that carries rights to less than 10% of the voting power in the tested company; or

     * (b) a *dividend stake that carries the right to receive less than 10% of any dividends that the tested company may pay; or

     * (c) a *capital stake that carries the right to receive less than 10% of any distribution of capital of the tested company;

    * then neither section 166225 nor section 166230 applies in respect of that stake.

    * (4) If the *depository entity (the **_old depository entity_**) is subsequently replaced by another depository entity (the **_new depository entity_**), then, at all times that the old depository entity held or is taken to have held a stake in the tested company, the new entity is taken to have held that stake.

    * (5) A **_depository entity_** is an entity:

     * (a) that is a central securities repository; and

     * (b) that provides custody of share certificates; and

     * (c) that provides services for the exchange of shares.

     * (c) the voting power that the entity has at the ownership test time is greater than the voting power that the entity had at the start of the test period;

    * then the entity is taken to have voting power in the company at the ownership test time only to the extent that it had it at the start of the test period.

     * (c) the percentage that the entity has rights to at the ownership test time is greater than the percentage (the **_lower percentage_**) of the dividends or distributions of capital of the company that the entity had rights to at the start of the test period;

    * then the entity is taken to have rights to the lower percentage of the dividends or distributions of capital at the ownership test time.

##### 166272  Same shares or interests to be held

    * Application

    * (1) This section modifies how the ownership tests in section 166145 are applied to a *voting stake, a *dividend stake or a *capital stake in the tested company held by one of the following entities (the **_stakeholder_**):

     * (a) a top interposed entity mentioned in section 166230 (which is about indirect stakes of less than 10%);

     * (b) a *widely held company mentioned in section 166240;

    * Exactly the same shares or interests must continue to be held

    * (2) For the purpose of determining whether the tested company has satisfied a condition or whether a time is a changeover time or an alteration time in respect of the tested company:

     * (a) a condition that has to be satisfied is not satisfied; or

     * (b) a time that, apart from this subsection, would not be a changeover time or alteration time is taken to be a changeover time or alteration time, as the case may be;

    * unless, at all relevant times:

     * (c) the only *shares in the tested company that are taken into account are exactly the same shares and are held by the same persons; and

     * (d) the only interests (including shares) in any other entity that is interposed between the stakeholder and the tested company that are taken into account are exactly the same interests and are held by the same persons.

    * What happens in case of share splitting

    * (3) If:

     * (a) a particular *share (an **_old share_**) in a company of which the stakeholder, or an entity interposed between the stakeholder and the tested company, is the holder at the start of the *test period is divided into 2 or more new shares during that period; and

     * (b) the stakeholder or entity becomes the holder of each of the new shares immediately after the division takes place and remains the holder until the end of that period;

    * the new shares are taken to be exactly the same shares as the old share.

    * What happens in case of splitting of units in a unit trust

    * (4) If:

     * (a) a particular unit (an **_old unit_**) in a unit trust of which the stakeholder, or an entity interposed between the stakeholder and the tested company, is the holder at the start of the *test period is divided into 2 or more new units during that period; and

     * (b) the stakeholder or entity becomes the holder of each of the new units immediately after the division takes place and remains the holder until the end of that period;

    * the new units are taken to be exactly the same units as the old unit.

    * What happens in case of consolidation of shares

    * (5) If:

     * (a) a particular *share (an **_old share_**) in a company of which the stakeholder, or an entity interposed between the stakeholder and the tested company, is the holder at the start of the *test period, and other shares (each of which is also called an **_old share_**) in the company of which the stakeholder or entity is the holder at the start of that period, are consolidated into a new share during that period; and

     * (b) the stakeholder or entity becomes the holder of the new share immediately after the consolidation takes place;

    * the new share is taken to be exactly the same share as the old shares.

    * What happens in case of consolidation of units in a unit trust

    * (6) If:

     * (a) a particular unit (an **_old unit_**) in a unit trust of which the stakeholder, or an entity interposed between the stakeholder and the tested company, is the holder at the start of the *test period and other units (each of which is also called an **_old unit_**) in the trust of which the stakeholder or entity is the holder at the start of that period are consolidated into a new unit during that period; and

     * (b) the stakeholder or entity becomes the holder of the new unit immediately after the consolidation takes place;

    * the new unit is taken to be exactly the same unit as the old units.

    * Totals of shares or rights not affected

    * (7) This section does not affect how *shares, and rights carried by shares, are counted for the purpose of determining:

     * (a) the total voting power in the tested company; or

     * (b) the total dividends that the tested company may pay; or

     * (c) the total distributions of capital of the tested company.

    * Conditions in section 166145 may be treated as having been satisfied in certain circumstances

    * (8) If any of the conditions in section 166145 have not been satisfied, those conditions are taken to have been satisfied if:

     * (a) they would have been satisfied except for the operation of subsection (2) of this section; and

     * (b) the tested company has information from which it would be reasonable to conclude that less than 50% of:

       * (i) the *tax loss; or

       * (ii) the *notional loss; or

       * (iii) the bad debt; or

       * (iv) the unrealised net loss (within the meaning of section 165115E);

     * as the case requires, has been reflected in deductions, capital losses, or reduced assessable income, that occurred, or could occur in future, because of the happening of any *CGT event in relation to any *direct equity interests or *indirect equity interests held in the tested company by the stakeholder, or an entity interposed between the stakeholder and the tested company, during the *test period.

    * Subsection (8) not to apply for purpose of determining whether an alteration time has occurred

    * (9) However, subsection (8) does not apply in relation to any of the conditions in section 166145 in so far as those conditions have effect for the purpose of determining whether an alteration time (within the meaning of section 165115L) has occurred.

    * Time of happening of CGT event

    * (10) The happening of any *CGT event in relation to a *direct equity interest or *indirect equity interest in the tested company that results in the failure of the tested company to satisfy a condition in section 166145 is taken, for the purposes of paragraph (8)(b), to have occurred during the *test period.

##### When the rules in this Subdivision do not apply

##### 166275  Rules in this Subdivision intended to be concessional

    * A company is taken to have met the conditions in section 16512, paragraph 16535(a) or section 165123, or a changeover time or an alteration time is taken not to have occurred in respect of a company, (as the case requires), if:

     * (a) a *tracing rule modifies how the ownership tests in section 166145 apply to the tested company in respect of a *voting stake, a *dividend stake or a *capital stake; and

     * (b) the company fails the tests (whether at the time of applying the tracing rule or at another time); and

     * (c) the company believes, on reasonable grounds, that if the tracing rule did not modify how the tests apply to the company in respect of that stake, it would not fail the tests.

         * Example: 11 people own shareholdings of 9% in the listed company. Under section 166225, one notional shareholder is deemed to hold all of those shareholdings. 2 of the people sell their shareholdings so that 9 of the original 11 people now own shareholdings of 11%. Without the rule in this section, the company would fail the ownership tests (as the rule in section 166225 no longer applies).

##### 166280  Controlled test companies

    * (1) A *tracing rule does not modify how the ownership tests in section 166145 apply to the tested company in respect of all or part of the voting power in the tested company, or all or some of the rights to *dividends of, or capital in, the tested company, if:

     * (a) either:

       * (i) an entity (the **_controlling entity_**) directly holds that power or has those rights; or

       * (ii) an entity (the **_controlling entity_**) indirectly holds that power or has those rights through one or more interposed entities; and

     * (b) the tested company is sufficiently influenced (within the meaning of paragraph 318(6)(b) of the _Income Tax Assessment Act 1936_) by the controlling entity.

         * Note: However, a tracing rule can modify how the ownership tests in section 166145 apply to the tested company in respect of voting power or dividend or capital rights held by entities other than controlling entities.

    * (2) A *tracing rule does not modify how the ownership tests in section 166145 apply to the tested company in respect of all or part of the voting power in the tested company if:

     * (a) the tested company is a *widely held company; and

     * (b) that voting power:

       * (i) is more than 25% of the total voting power in the tested company and is controlled (whether directly, or indirectly through one or more interposed entities) by a natural person, together with his or her *associates; or

       * (ii) is more than 50% of the total voting power in the tested company and is controlled (whether directly, or indirectly through one or more interposed entities) by a trustee or company, together with its associates.

##### 1705  Basic principles for transferring tax losses

    * (1) A company can transfer a tax loss to another company so that the other company can deduct it in the income year of the transfer.

    * (2) Both companies must be members of the same whollyowned group. There are other eligibility requirements that they must also satisfy.

    * (2A) One of the companies must be an Australian branch of a foreign bank. The other company must be:

     * (a) the head company of a consolidated group or MEC group; or

     * (b) _not_ a member of a consolidatable group.

         * Note: This Subdivision applies to Australian permanent establishments of foreign entities that are financial entities in the same way as it applies to Australian branches of foreign banks. See section 17075.

    * (3) The transferred loss must be "surplus" in the sense that the transferring company cannot use it because there is not enough assessable income to offset it. The other company must have enough assessable income to offset the transferred tax loss.

    * (4) Neither company must be prevented from deducting the loss by Division 165 or 175. 

         * Note: Division 165 deals with the income tax consequences of changing ownership or control of a company. Division 175 deals with using a company's tax losses to avoid income tax.

    * (5) The tax loss is transferred by an agreement between the 2 companies. 

    * (6) The tax loss can be transferred in the same year as it is incurred. In that case different rules apply.

##### Effect of transferring a tax loss

##### 17010  When a company can transfer a tax loss

    * (1) A company (the **_loss company_**) can transfer an amount of its *tax loss for an income year (the **_loss year_**) to another company (the **_income company_**) if the conditions in this Subdivision are met.

    * (2) The amount transferred can be the whole or part of the *tax loss.

         * Note: A PDF cannot transfer a tax loss, except one for a period before it became a PDF: see section 19510.

##### 17015  Income company is taken to have incurred transferred loss

    * (1) If an amount of a *tax loss is transferred, the amount is taken to be a tax loss incurred by the *income company in the *loss year.

    * (2) However, if the *loss year is the same as the income year of the transfer, the *income company is taken to have incurred the *tax loss in the income year before the loss year.

         * Note: This rule is needed because Division 36 allows a tax loss to be deducted only if it was incurred in an _earlier_ income year.

    * (3) Despite subsection (1), if the *tax loss is transferred because the conditions in section 17032 are met, the *income company is taken to have incurred the tax loss for the income year for which the first prior transferor mentioned in that section incurred the tax loss.

    * (4) Despite subsection (1), if the *tax loss is transferred because the condition in subsection 17042(4) is met, the *income company is taken to have incurred the tax loss for the income year for which that subsection assumes the income company incurred the tax loss.

##### 17020  Who can deduct transferred loss

    * (1) If an amount of a *tax loss is transferred, the *income company can deduct the amount in accordance with section 3617 (which is about how to deduct a tax loss), but only for the income year of the income company for which the amount is transferred. That income year is called the **_deduction year_**.

    * (2) The *loss company can no longer *utilise the transferred amount and is taken not to have incurred the *tax loss to the extent of that amount.

##### 17025  Tax treatment of consideration for transferred tax loss

    * (1) If the *loss company receives any consideration from the *income company for the amount of the *tax loss:

     * (a) so much of the consideration as is given for the amount of the tax loss is neither assessable income nor exempt income of the loss company; and

     * (b) a *capital gain does not accrue to the loss company because of the receipt of the consideration.

         * Note: However, the consideration may affect how section 170210 modifies the cost base of direct and indirect interests in the loss company.

    * (2) If the *income company gives any consideration to the *loss company for the amount of the *tax loss:

     * (a) the income company cannot deduct the amount or value of the consideration; and

     * (b) the income company does not incur a *capital loss because of the giving of the consideration.

         * Note: However, the consideration may affect how section 170215 modifies the cost base of direct and indirect interests in the income company.

##### Conditions for transfer

##### 17030  Companies must be in existence and members of the same whollyowned group etc.

    * (1) Both companies must be in existence during at least part of each of the following income years:

     * (a) the *loss year; and

     * (b) the *deduction year; and

     * (c) any intervening income year.

         * Note: In some cases, this condition may not apply, or may be taken to be met even if it is not actually met. See sections 17032 and 17033.

    * (2) Also, both companies must be members of the same *whollyowned group during the whole or part of those income years when both companies were in existence.

         * Note: In some cases, this condition may not apply, or may be taken to be met even if it is not actually met. See sections 17032 and 17033.

    * (3) One of the companies must be an Australian branch (as defined in Part IIIB of the _Income Tax Assessment Act 1936_) of a *foreign bank.

         * Note: The Australian branch can be taken to be a separate entity from the foreign bank for this Subdivision. See Part IIIB of the _Income Tax Assessment Act 1936_.

    * (4) The other company must be covered by an item of this table.

##### 17032  Tax loss incurred by the loss company because of a transfer under Subdivision 707A

    * When the conditions in this section apply

    * (1) The conditions in this section apply instead of the conditions in subsections 17030(1) and (2) if:

     * (a) the *income company is an Australian branch (as defined in Part IIIB of the _Income Tax Assessment Act 1936_) of a *foreign bank; and

     * (b) the *loss company incurred the *tax loss because of one or more transfers of the tax loss under Subdivision 707A.

    * Conditions

    * (2) Each transferor (**_prior transferor_**) of the *tax loss under Subdivision 707A must have been a company.

    * (3) It must have been possible to meet the conditions in subsections 17030(1) and (2) in relation to the *loss company and the *income company assuming:

     * (a) the *loss year were so much of the income year in which the *tax loss was transferred to the loss company under Subdivision 707A as occurred after the transfer; and

     * (b) so much (if any) of the *deduction year as occurred before the transfer were disregarded.

    * (4) The *income company and each prior transferor must both be in existence during at least part of each of these periods:

     * (a) the period consisting of:

       * (i) if the prior transferor incurred the *tax loss apart from Subdivision 707A--the *loss year; or

       * (ii) if the prior transferor incurred the tax loss because of a transfer under Subdivision 707A (other than a transfer from the prior transferor to itself)--so much of the income year in which the transfer occurred as was after the transfer (but before any later transfer of the loss from the prior transferor under that Subdivision);

     * (b) so much of the income year during which the tax loss was transferred under Subdivision 707A from the prior transferor to another company as occurs before the transfer (but after the start of the period described in paragraph (a));

     * (c) any intervening income year.

    * (5) The *income company must be a member of the same *whollyowned group as each prior transferor during the whole or part of the periods described in subsection (4) for the prior transferor when both were in existence.

##### 17033  Alternative test of relations between the loss company and other companies

    * (1) The conditions in subsections 17030(1) and (2) are taken to be met in relation to the *loss company and the *income company if:

     * (a) the loss company is an Australian branch (as defined in Part IIIB of the _Income Tax Assessment Act 1936_) of a *foreign bank; and

     * (b) the income company is covered by item 1 or 2 of the table in subsection 17030(4) (because the company is the *head company of a *consolidated group or *MEC group at the time described in that item); and

     * (c) the relevant circumstances in this section exist.

    * Circumstances

    * (2) One circumstance is that there is another company (the **_first link company_**) in relation to which all these conditions are met:

     * (a) the first link company became a *subsidiary member of a *consolidated group or *MEC group after the start of the *loss year but before the time described in the item of the table in subsection 17030(4) that covers the *income company;

     * (b) the *tax loss could have been transferred from the *loss company to the first link company under this Subdivision (apart from subsection 17030(4) and this section) for a *deduction year consisting of the *trial year for the first link company becoming a subsidiary member of that group had:

       * (i) the first link company continued to be *in existence as a separate entity (rather than being part of the head company of that group) when it was a subsidiary member of that group; and

       * (ii) the trial year not started before the start of the loss year; and

       * (iii) the first link company had enough assessable income for the trial year;

     * (c) the tax loss would have been incurred by the income company because of one or more transfers under Subdivision 707A assuming the tax loss had been made by the first link company (apart from that Subdivision) for the loss year.

    * (3) If the condition in paragraph (2)(c) could be met only if there had been a transfer described in that paragraph involving a company other than the first link company and the *income company, another circumstance is that the other company and the *loss company were *in existence and members of the same *whollyowned group for the period:

     * (a) starting when the *tax loss would have been transferred under Subdivision 707A _to_ the other company as described in that paragraph; and

     * (b) ending when the tax loss would have been transferred under Subdivision 707A _from_ the other company as described in that paragraph.

    * (4) It does not matter whether or not any of the transfers mentioned in subsection (3) would have involved the first link company or the *income company as well as the other company.

    * (5) Another circumstance is that the conditions in subsections 17030(1) and (2) would have been met for the *loss company and the *income company assuming:

     * (a) the *loss year consisted of the part of the income year in which the *tax loss would have been transferred to the income company under Subdivision 707A as described in paragraph (2)(c) occurring after the time the transfer would have occurred; and

     * (b) so much (if any) of the *deduction year as occurred before the time the transfer would have occurred were disregarded.

##### 17035  The loss company

    * (1) The *loss company:

     * (a) must be an Australian resident and not a *prescribed dual resident; and

     * (b) must not be a *dual resident investment company in either the *loss year or the *deduction year.

    * (2) If the *loss year and the *deduction year are the same, it must be the case that the *loss company was _not_ required to calculate the *tax loss:

     * (a) under section 16570 (because of a change in ownership or control); or 

     * (b) under section 17535 (because of injected income or deductions).

    * (3) Also, it must be the case that neither Subdivision 165A nor Subdivision 175A would have prevented the *loss company from deducting the *tax loss in the *deduction year if it had had enough assessable income (including *assessable film income) to offset the tax loss.

         * Note 1: Subdivision 165A deals with the deductibility of a company's tax loss for an earlier income year if there has been a change in the ownership or control of the company in the loss year or the income year. Subdivision 175A is about the Commissioner preventing a company from getting certain tax benefits through its unused tax losses.

         * Note 2: Division 707 affects the operation of Subdivision 165A if the loss company incurred the tax loss because of a transfer under Subdivision 707A.

##### 17040  The income company 

    * (1) The *income company must be an Australian resident and not a *prescribed dual resident.

    * (2) It must not be prevented by Division 165 or 175 from deducting the transferred amount in the *deduction year. Those Divisions do not apply to the *income company if the *loss year and the *deduction year are the same.

         * Note 1: Division 165 deals with the income tax consequences of changing ownership or control of a company. Division 175 deals with using a company's tax losses to avoid income tax.

         * Note 2: The condition in subsection (2) may not apply in some cases. See section 17042.

##### 17042  If the income company has become the head company of a consolidated group or MEC group

    * (1) The condition in subsection (2) of this section applies to the *income company instead of the condition in subsection 17040(2) if the conditions in subsections 17030(1) and (2) are met in relation to the *loss company and the income company apart from section 17033 and either:

     * (a) both these circumstances exist:

       * (i) after the start of the *loss year but before the relevant time described in subsection 17030(4), the income company became the *head company of a *consolidated group or of a *MEC group that came into existence after the start of the loss year;

       * (ii) the loss year and *deduction year are not the same; or

     * (b) all these circumstances exist:

       * (i) the income company is, at the relevant time described in subsection 17030(4), the head company of a MEC group;

       * (ii) before that time but after the end of the loss year, the MEC group was involved in an application event described in section 719300 (but not covered by subsection 719300(4) or (5));

       * (iii) the income company would be taken under section 719305 to have transferred losses to itself under Subdivision 707A, assuming it had made losses while head company of the group or of a consolidated group involved in the event;

       * (iv) the MEC group or consolidated group came into existence before the start of the *loss year.

         * Note: An application event involves either expanding an existing MEC group by including extra eligible tier1 companies of the top company for the group or creating a MEC group because more companies become eligible tier1 companies of the top company of which the head company of a consolidated group is an eligible tier1 company.

    * (2) The *income company must have been able to deduct the *tax loss in the *deduction year assuming that it had incurred the tax loss for the *loss year.

    * (3) The condition in subsection (4) of this section applies to the *income company instead of the condition in subsection 17040(2) if the conditions in subsections 17030(1) and (2) are met in relation to the *loss company and the income company because of section 17033.

    * (4) The *income company must have been able to deduct the *tax loss in the *deduction year assuming that it had incurred the tax loss, for the income year in which the loss would have been transferred to it as described in paragraph 17033(2)(c), because of one or more transfers under Subdivision 707A described in that paragraph.

##### 17045  Maximum amount that can be transferred

    * Loss company can only transfer what it cannot use itself

    * (1) The amount transferred cannot exceed what would be the amount of the *loss company's *unutilised *tax loss at the end of the *deduction year if the loss company utilised the tax loss to the greatest extent possible.

    * Transferred loss must not exceed what the income company can use

    * (2) The amount transferred also cannot exceed the amount worked out as follows:

Method statement

       * Step 1.	Add together the *income company's assessable income and *net exempt income (if any) for the *deduction year.

       * Step 2.	Subtract the *income company's deductions for the *deduction year, except deductions for amounts of *tax losses transferred to the income company (by the *loss company or any other company).

       * Step 3.	Subtract the *income company's deductions for the *deduction year for amounts of *tax losses transferred to the income company (by the *loss company or any other company) by agreements made _before_ the agreement by which the first amount is transferred.

         * Example: In the deduction year:

          *  	the income company has assessable income of $60,000, net exempt income of $10,000 and deductions of $25,000 (apart from the transferred loss); and

          *  	another company, being a member of the same whollyowned group as the income company, transferred a tax loss of $15,000 to the income company; and

          *  	the loss company incurred a tax loss of $50,000.

         * Of the $50,000 loss, the loss company can transfer no more than $30,000 ($60,000+$10,000$25,000$15,000) to the income company.

    * (3) Subsection (2) does not apply if the *tax loss is a *film loss. In that case, the amount transferred also cannot exceed the amount worked out as follows:

Method statement

       * Step 1.	Add together the *income company's *net assessable film income and *net exempt film income (if any) for the *deduction year.

       * Step 2.	Subtract the *income company's deductions for the *deduction year for amounts of *film losses transferred to the income company (by the *loss company or any other company) by agreements made _before_ the agreement by which the first amount is transferred.

    * (4) Subsections (2) and (3) do not apply if the transfer occurs because either or both of the conditions in subsections 17042(2) and (4) are met. In that case, the amount transferred also cannot exceed the amount worked out as follows:

Method statement

       * Step 1.	Identify each *bundle of losses that, on the assumption in subsection 17042(2) or (4) (as appropriate), would have included the *tax loss or *film loss (as appropriate).

            * Note 1: There will be 2 or more bundles of losses identified if both of the conditions in subsections 17042(2) and (4) are met.

            * Note 2: There will be more than 1 bundle of losses identified on the basis of the assumption in paragraph 17042(4) if the conditions in subsections 17030(1) and (2) are met in relation to the loss company and the income company because of multiple applications of section 17033 each involving a different first link company.

       * Step 2.	For each *bundle identified, work out how much of the *tax loss or *film loss (as appropriate) the *income company would have been able to deduct in the *deduction year assuming that:

         * (a) the loss could have been deducted in that year only after the deduction in that year of any other losses of that *sort that would have been included in the bundle, other than losses (the **_transferable losses_**) that could be transferred from the *loss company to the income company for that year; and

         * (b) if the bundle would have included 2 or more transferable losses of that sort--those losses could have been deducted only in the order in which the loss company incurred them.

            * Note 1: If the assumption in subsection 17042(2) is relevant to the bundle, it would have included losses incurred by the income company and transferred (or taken to be transferred) to the company (from itself) under Subdivision 707A.

            * Note 2: If the assumption in paragraph 17042(4) is relevant to the bundle, it would have included losses actually incurred by the first link company and transferred (by one or more transfers under Subdivision 707A) to the income company.

       * Step 3.	Total every result of step 2 for the *tax loss or *film loss (as appropriate).

##### 17050  Transfer by written agreement

    * **	**(1)	The transfer must be made by a written agreement between the *loss company and the *income company.

    * (2) The agreement must:

     * (a) specify the income year of the transfer (which may be earlier than the income year in which the agreement is made); and

     * (b) specify the amount of the *tax loss being transferred; and

     * (c) be signed by the public officer of each company; and

     * (d) be made on or before the day of lodgement of the *income company's *income tax return for the *deduction year, or within such further time as the Commissioner allows.

         * Note: The agreement will usually be made in the next income year _after_ the one for which the income company will deduct the loss.

##### 17055  Losses must be transferred in order they are incurred

    * (1) If the *loss company has 2 or more *tax losses (other than *film losses) that it can transfer in the *deduction year, it can transfer them only in the order in which it incurred them.

    * (2) If the *loss company has 2 or more *film losses that it can transfer in the *deduction year, it can transfer them only in the order in which it incurred them.

    * (3) If:

     * (a) the *loss company has 2 or more *tax losses, or 2 or more *film losses, it can transfer for the *deduction year; and

     * (b) it incurred at least one of those losses apart from Subdivision 707A and at least one of those losses because of a transfer under that Subdivision;

    * it can transfer under this Subdivision the losses it incurred because of a transfer under Subdivision 707A only _after_ transferring under this Subdivision the losses it incurred apart from that Subdivision.

    * (4) For the purposes of subsection (3), treat a loss incurred by the company both apart from that Subdivision and because of a transfer under that Subdivision as a loss incurred because of a transfer under that Subdivision.

    * (5) Subsections (1) and (2) have effect subject to subsection (3).

##### 17060  Income company cannot transfer transferred tax loss

    * The *income company cannot transfer an amount of a *tax loss transferred to it, or any part of the amount.

##### Effect of agreement to transfer more than can be transferred

##### 17065  Agreement transfers as much as can be transferred

    * (1) If the amount specified in an agreement exceeds the maximum amount that the *loss company can transfer to the *income company in the *deduction year, only that maximum amount is taken to have been transferred.

    * (2) One reason why an agreement might specify more than can be transferred is that an assessment has been amended since the agreement.

##### 17070  Amendment of assessments

    * The Commissioner may amend an assessment to disallow a deduction for a transferred amount of a *tax loss:

     * (a) if the agreement to transfer the tax loss is ineffective because the *loss company did not actually incur the loss; or

     * (b) to the extent that section 17065 reduces the transferred amount of a tax loss because the loss company did not actually incur some of it.

    * The Commissioner may do so despite section 170 (Amendment of assessments) of the _Income Tax Assessment Act 1936_.

##### Australian permanent establishments of foreign financial entities

##### 17075  Treatment like Australian branches of foreign banks

    * (1) The object of this section is to let *tax losses be transferred under this Subdivision to and from *Australian permanent establishments of *foreign entities that are *financial entities in the same way as tax losses can be transferred to and from Australian branches of *foreign banks.

    * (2) This Subdivision (except this section) applies to an *Australian permanent establishment of a *foreign entity that is a *financial entity in the same way as this Subdivision applies to an Australian branch (as defined in Part IIIB of the _Income Tax Assessment Act 1936_) of a *foreign bank.

##### Subdivision 170B--Transfer of net capital losses within certain whollyowned groups of companies

##### Guide to Subdivision 170B

##### 170101  What this Subdivision is about

    * A company can transfer a surplus amount of its net capital loss to another company so that the other company can apply the amount in working out its net capital gain for the income year of the transfer. One of the companies must be an Australian branch of a foreign bank, and both companies must be members of the same whollyowned group.

      * 170170	Amendment of assessments

  * Australian permanent establishments of foreign financial entities

      * 170174	Treatment like Australian branches of foreign banks

##### 170105  Basic principles for transferring a net capital loss

    * (1) A company can transfer a net capital loss (except a net capital loss from collectables) to another company so that the other company can apply it in working out its net capital gain for the income year of the transfer.

    * (2) Both companies must be members of the same whollyowned group. There are other eligibility requirements that they must also satisfy.

    * (2A) One of the companies must be an Australian branch of a foreign bank. The other company must be:

     * (a) the head company of a consolidated group or MEC group; or

     * (b) _not_ a member of a consolidatable group.

         * Note: This Subdivision applies to Australian permanent establishments of foreign entities that are financial entities in the same way as it applies to Australian branches of foreign banks. See section 170174.

    * (3) The transferred loss must be "surplus" in the sense that, for the income year of the transfer, the transferring company does not have enough capital gains against which to apply it. The other company must have enough capital gains against which to apply it.

    * (5) Neither company must be prevented by Subdivision 165CA or 175CA from applying the loss in working out its net capital gain for the income year of the transfer. 

         * Note: Subdivision 165CA deals with the consequences of changing ownership or control of a company. Subdivision 175CA deals with using a company's net capital losses to avoid income tax.

    * (6) The net capital loss is transferred by an agreement between the 2 companies. 

    * (7) The net capital loss can be transferred in the same year as it is made. In that case different rules apply.

    * (8) The provisions of Subdivision 170C (so far as they relate to the transfer of net capital losses) are to be disregarded in applying the provisions of this Subdivision where the relevant agreement referred to in section 170150 was made before 22 February 1999.

##### Effect of transferring a net capital loss

##### 170110  When a company can transfer a net capital loss

    * (1) A company (the **_loss company_**) can transfer an amount of its *net capital loss for an income year (the **_capital loss year_**) to another company (the **_gain company_**) if the conditions in this Subdivision are met.

    * (2) The amount transferred can be the whole or part of the *net capital loss.

         * Note: A PDF cannot transfer a net capital loss, except one for a period before it became a PDF: see section 19530 of the _Income Tax Assessment Act 1997_.

##### 170115  Who can apply transferred loss

    * (1) If an amount of a *net capital loss is transferred, the gain company can apply the amount in working out its *net capital gain, but only for the income year of the gain company for which the amount is transferred. That income year is called the **_application year_**.

         * Note: A company's net capital gain or net capital loss for an income year is usually worked out under section 1025 or 10210.

    * (2) The loss company can no longer *utilise the transferred amount and is taken not to have made the *net capital loss to the extent of that amount.

    * (3) Despite subsection (1), if the *net capital loss is transferred because the conditions in section 170132 are met, the gain company is taken to have made the net capital loss for the income year for which the first prior transferor mentioned in that section made the net capital loss.

    * (4) Despite subsection (1), if the *net capital loss is transferred because the condition in subsection 170142(4) is met, the gain company is taken to have made the net capital loss for the income year for which that subsection assumes the gain company made the net capital loss.

##### 170120  Gain company is taken to have made transferred loss

    * (1) If an amount of a *net capital loss is transferred, the amount is taken to be a *net capital loss of the gain company for the capital loss year.

    * (2) However, if the capital loss year is the same as the application year, the amount is taken to be a *capital loss of the gain company for the application year.

##### 170125  Tax treatment of consideration for transferred tax loss 

    * (1) If the loss company receives consideration from the gain company for the transferred amount:

     * (a) the consideration is neither assessable income nor *exempt income of the loss company; and

     * (b) the loss company does not make a *capital gain because of receiving the consideration.

         * Note: However, the consideration may affect how section 170220 modifies the cost base of direct and indirect interests in the loss company.

    * (2) If the gain company gives consideration to the loss company for the transferred amount:

     * (a) the gain company cannot deduct the consideration; and

     * (b) the gain company does not make a *capital loss because of giving the consideration.

         * Note: However, the consideration may affect how section 170225 modifies the cost base of direct and indirect interests in the gain company.

##### Conditions for transfer

##### 170130  Companies must be in existence and members of the same whollyowned group etc.

    * (1) Both companies must be in existence during at least part of each of the following income years:

     * (a) the capital loss year; and

     * (b) the application year; and

     * (c) any intervening income year.

         * Note: In some cases, this condition may not apply, or may be taken to be met even if it is not actually met. See sections 170132 and 170133.

    * (2) Also, both companies must be members of the same *whollyowned group at all times during those income years when both companies were in existence.

         * Note: In some cases, this condition may not apply, or may be taken to be met even if it is not actually met. See sections 170132 and 170133.

    * (3) One of the companies must be an Australian branch (as defined in Part IIIB of the _Income Tax Assessment Act 1936_) of a *foreign bank.

         * Note: The Australian branch can be taken to be a separate entity from the foreign bank for this Subdivision. See Part IIIB of the _Income Tax Assessment Act 1936_.

    * (4) The other company must be covered by an item of this table.

##### 170132  Net capital loss made by the loss company because of a transfer under Subdivision 707A

    * When the conditions in this section apply

    * (1) The conditions in this section apply instead of the conditions in subsections 170130(1) and (2) if:

     * (a) the gain company is an Australian branch (as defined in Part IIIB of the _Income Tax Assessment Act 1936_) of a *foreign bank; and

     * (b) the *loss company made the *net capital loss because of one or more transfers of the net capital loss under Subdivision 707A.

    * Conditions

    * (2) Each transferor (**_prior transferor_**) of the *net capital loss under Subdivision 707A must have been a company.

    * (3) It must have been possible to meet the conditions in subsections 170130(1) and (2) in relation to the *loss company and the gain company assuming:

     * (a) the capital loss year were so much of the income year in which the *net capital loss was transferred to the loss company under Subdivision 707A as occurred after the transfer; and

     * (b) so much (if any) of the application year as occurred before the transfer were disregarded.

    * (4) The gain company and each prior transferor must both be in existence during at least part of each of these periods:

     * (a) the period consisting of:

       * (i) if the prior transferor made the *net capital loss apart from Subdivision 707A--the capital loss year; or

       * (ii) if the prior transferor made the net capital loss because of a transfer under Subdivision 707A (other than a transfer from the prior transferor to itself)--so much of the income year in which the transfer occurred as was after the transfer (but before any later transfer of the loss from the prior transferor under that Subdivision);

     * (b) so much of the income year during which the net capital loss was transferred under Subdivision 707A from the prior transferor to another company as occurs before the transfer (but after the start of the period described in paragraph (a));

     * (c) any intervening income year.

    * (5) The gain company must be a member of the same *whollyowned group as each prior transferor during the whole or part of the periods described in subsection (4) for the prior transferor when both were in existence.

##### 170133  Alternative test of relations between the loss company and other companies

    * (1) The conditions in subsections 170130(1) and (2) are taken to be met in relation to the *loss company and the gain company if:

     * (a) the loss company is an Australian branch (as defined in Part IIIB of the _Income Tax Assessment Act 1936_) of a *foreign bank; and

     * (b) the gain company is covered by item 1 or 2 of the table in subsection 170130(4) (because the company is the *head company of a *consolidated group or *MEC group at the time described in that item); and

     * (c) the relevant circumstances in this section exist.

    * Circumstances

    * (2) One circumstance is that there is another company (the **_first link company_**) in relation to which all these conditions are met:

     * (a) the first link company became a *subsidiary member of a *consolidated group or *MEC group after the start of the capital loss year but before the time described in the item of the table in subsection 170130(4) that covers the gain company;

     * (b) the *net capital loss could have been transferred from the *loss company to the first link company under this Subdivision (apart from subsection 170130(4) and this section) for an application year consisting of the *trial year for the first link company becoming a subsidiary member of that group had:

       * (i) the first link company continued to be in existence as a separate entity (rather than being part of the head company of that group) when it was a subsidiary member of that group; and

       * (ii) the trial year not started before the start of the capital loss year; and

       * (iii) the first link company had enough *capital gains for the trial year;

     * (c) the net capital loss would have been made by the gain company because of one or more transfers under Subdivision 707A assuming the net capital loss had been made by the first link company (apart from that Subdivision) for the capital loss year.

    * (3) If the condition in paragraph (2)(c) could be met only if there had been a transfer described in that paragraph involving a company other than the first link company and the gain company, another circumstance is that the other company and the *loss company were in existence and members of the same *whollyowned group for the period:

     * (a) starting when the *net capital loss would have been transferred under Subdivision 707A _to_ the other company as described in that paragraph; and

     * (b) ending when the net capital loss would have been transferred under Subdivision 707A _from_ the other company as described in that paragraph.

    * (4) It does not matter whether or not any of the transfers mentioned in subsection (3) would have involved the first link company or the gain company as well as the other company.

    * (5) Another circumstance is that the conditions in subsection 170130(1) and (2) would have been met for the *loss company and the gain company assuming:

     * (a) the capital loss year consisted of the part of the income year in which the *net capital loss would have been transferred to the gain company under Subdivision 707A as described in paragraph (2)(c) occurring after the time the transfer would have occurred; and

     * (b) so much (if any) of the application year as occurred before the time the transfer would have occurred were disregarded.

##### 170135  The loss company

    * (1) The loss company:

     * (a) must be an Australian resident (but not a *prescribed dual resident) throughout the capital loss year; and

     * (b) must not be a *dual resident investment company in either the capital loss year or the application year.

    * (2) It must be the case that the loss company was _not_ required to calculate the *net capital loss:

     * (a) under section 165114 (because of a change in ownership or control); or 

     * (b) under section 17575 (because of an injected capital gain or loss).

    * (3) Also, it must be the case that neither Subdivision 165CA nor Subdivision 175CA would have prevented the loss company from applying the *net capital loss in working out its *net capital gain for the application year if it had made enough *capital gains in that year.

         * Note 1: Subdivision 165CA deals with the consequences of changing ownership or control of a company. Subdivision 175CA deals with using a company's net capital losses to avoid income tax.

         * Note 2: Division 707 affects the operation of Subdivision 165CA if the loss company made the net capital loss because of a transfer under Subdivision 707A.

         * Note 3: A company's net capital gain or net capital loss for an income year is usually worked out under section 1025 or 10210.

##### 170140  The gain company

    * (1) The gain company must be an Australian resident throughout the application year.

    * (2) If the capital loss year and the application year are _not_ the same, the gain company must not be prevented by Subdivision 165CA or 175CA from applying the transferred amount in working out its *net capital gain for the application year. 

         * Note 1: Subdivision 165CA deals with the consequences of changing ownership or control of a company. Subdivision 175CA deals with using a company's net capital losses to avoid income tax.

         * Note 2: A company's net capital gain or net capital loss for an income year is usually worked out under section 1025 or 10210.

         * Note 3: The condition in subsection (2) may not apply in some cases. See section 170142.

    * (3) If the capital loss year and the application year _are_ the same, it must be the case that the gain company was _not_ required to calculate its own *net capital gain or *net capital loss for the application year:

     * (a) under Subdivision 165CB (because of a change in ownership or control); or 

     * (b) under section 17575 (because of an injected capital gain or loss).

         * Note: In deciding whether paragraph (b) applies, remember that the transferred amount is taken to be a capital loss of the gain company for the application year (because of subsection 170120(2)).

##### 170142  If the gain company has become the head company of a consolidated group or MEC group

    * (1) The condition in subsection (2) of this section applies to the gain company instead of the condition in subsection 170140(2) if the conditions in subsections 170130(1) and (2) are met in relation to the *loss company and the gain company apart from section 170133 and either:

     * (a) both these circumstances exist:

       * (i) after the start of the capital loss year but before the relevant time described in subsection 170130(4), the gain company became the *head company of a *consolidated group or of a *MEC group that came into existence after the start of the capital loss year;

       * (ii) the capital loss year and application year are not the same; or

     * (b) all these circumstances exist:

       * (i) the gain company is, at the relevant time described in subsection 170130(4), the head company of a MEC group;

       * (ii) before that time but after the end of the capital loss year, the MEC group was involved in an application event described in section 719300 (but not covered by subsection 719300(4) or (5));

       * (iii) the gain company would be taken under section 719305 to have transferred losses to itself under Subdivision 707A, assuming it had made losses while head company of the group or of a consolidated group involved in the event;

       * (iv) the MEC group or consolidated group came into existence before the start of the capital loss year.

         * Note: An application event involves either expanding an existing MEC group by including extra eligible tier1 companies of the top company for the group or creating a MEC group because more companies become eligible tier1 companies of the top company of which the head company of a consolidated group is an eligible tier1 company.

    * (2) The gain company must have been able to apply the *net capital loss in working out its *net capital gain for the application year assuming that it had made the net capital loss for the capital loss year.

    * (3) The condition in subsection (4) of this section applies to the gain company instead of the condition in subsection 170140(2) if the conditions in subsections 170130(1) and (2) are met in relation to the *loss company and the gain company because of section 170133.

    * (4) The gain company must have been able to apply the *net capital loss in working out its *net capital gain for the application year assuming that it had made the net capital loss, for the income year in which the loss would have been transferred to it as described in paragraph 170133(2)(c), because of one or more transfers under Subdivision 707A described in that paragraph.

##### 170145  Maximum amount that can be transferred

    * Loss company can only transfer what it cannot use itself

    * (1) The amount transferred cannot exceed what would be the amount of the *loss company's *unutilised *net capital loss at the end of the application year if the loss company utilised the net capital loss to the greatest extent possible.

         * Note: If the capital loss year and the application year are the same, the _whole_ of the net capital loss would be unutilised, because section 1025 does not allow a net capital loss to be applied in the income year in which it was made.

         * Example: In the application year the loss company has:

          *  	a net capital loss from an earlier income year of $25,000; and

          *  	other capital losses totalling $10,000; and

          *  	capital gains totalling $20,000;

         * Of the $25,000 loss, the loss company can transfer to the gain company no more than:

    * Transferred loss must not exceed what the gain company can use

    * (5) No amount can be transferred if, apart from the operation of this section, the gain company would _not_ have a *net capital gain for the application year.

    * (6) The amount transferred also cannot exceed the amount worked out as follows:

Method statement

       * Step 1.	Work out what, apart from the operation of this section, would have been the gain company's *net capital gain for the application year.

       * Step 2.	Subtract each amount that:

         * (a) the gain company can apply under section 170115 in working out its *net capital gain for the application year; and

         * (b) was transferred to the gain company (by the loss company or any other company) by an agreement made _before_ the agreement by which the first amount is transferred.

         * Example: In the application year:

          *  	the gain company has capital gains totalling $60,000 and capital losses totalling $25,000; and

          *  	another company, being a member of the same whollyowned group as the gain company, transferred a net capital loss of $15,000 to the gain company; and

          *  	the loss company incurred a net capital loss of $50,000.

         * Of the $50,000 loss, the loss company can transfer to the gain company no more than:

    * (7) Subsection (6) does not apply if the transfer occurs because either or both of the conditions in subsections 170142(2) and (4) are met. In that case, the amount transferred also cannot exceed the amount worked out as follows:

Method statement

       * Step 1.	Identify each *bundle of losses that, on the assumption in subsection 170142(2) or (4) (as appropriate), would have included the *net capital loss.

            * Note 1: There will be 2 or more bundles of losses identified if both of the conditions in subsections 170142(2) and (4) are met.

            * Note 2: There will be more than 1 bundle of losses identified on the basis of the assumption in paragraph 170142(4) if the conditions in subsections 170130(1) and (2) are met in relation to the loss company and the gain company because of multiple applications of section 170133 each involving a different first link company.

       * Step 2.	For each *bundle identified, work out how much of the *net capital loss the gain company would have been able to apply in working out its *net capital gain for the application year assuming that:

         * (a) the loss could have been applied in that year only after the application in that year of any other losses of that *sort that would have been included in the bundle, other than losses (the **_transferable losses_**) that could be transferred from the *loss company to the gain company for that year; and

         * (b) if the bundle would have included 2 or more transferable losses of that sort--those losses could have been applied only in the order in which the loss company made them.

            * Note 1: If the assumption in subsection 170142(2) is relevant to the bundle, it would have included losses made by the gain company and transferred (or taken to be transferred) to the company (from itself) under Subdivision 707A.

            * Note 2: If the assumption in paragraph 170142(4) is relevant to the bundle, it would have included losses actually made by the first link company and transferred (by one or more transfers under Subdivision 707A) to the gain company.

       * Step 3.	Total every result of step 2 for the *net capital loss.

##### 170150  Transfer by written agreement

    * (1) The transfer must be made by a written agreement between the loss company and the gain company.

    * (2) The agreement must:

     * (a) specify the income year of the transfer (which may be earlier than the income year in which the agreement is made); and

     * (b) specify the amount of the *net capital loss being transferred; and

     * (c) be signed by the public officer of each company; and

     * (d) be made on or before the day of lodgment of the gain company's *income tax return for the application year, or within such further time as the Commissioner allows.

         * Note: The agreement will usually be made in the next income year _after_ the one for which the gain company will apply the loss.

##### 170155  Losses must be transferred in order they are made

    * (1) If the loss company has 2 or more *net capital losses that it can transfer in the application year, it can transfer them only in the order in which it made them.

    * (2) If:

     * (a) the *loss company has 2 or more *net capital losses it can transfer for the application year; and

     * (b) it made at least one of those losses apart from Subdivision 707A and at least one of those losses because of a transfer under that Subdivision;

    * it can transfer under this Subdivision the losses it made because of a transfer under Subdivision 707A only _after_ transferring under this Subdivision the losses it made apart from that Subdivision.

    * (3) For the purposes of subsection (2), treat a loss made by the company both apart from Subdivision 707A and because of a transfer under that Subdivision as a loss made because of a transfer under that Subdivision.

    * (4) Subsection (1) has effect subject to subsection (2).

##### 170160  Gain company cannot transfer transferred net capital loss

    * The gain company cannot transfer an amount of a *net capital loss transferred to it, or any part of the amount.

##### Effect of agreement to transfer more than can be transferred

##### 170165  Agreement transfers as much as can be transferred

    * (1) If the amount specified in an agreement exceeds the maximum amount that the loss company can transfer to the gain company in the application year, only that maximum amount is taken to have been transferred.

    * (2) One reason why an agreement might specify more than can be transferred is that an assessment has been amended since the agreement.

##### 170170  Amendment of assessments

    * The Commissioner may amend an assessment to *disallow a transferred amount of a *net capital loss:

     * (a) if the agreement to transfer the net capital loss is ineffective because the loss company did not actually make the loss; or

     * (b) to the extent that section 170165 reduces the transferred amount because the loss company did not actually make some of it.

    * The Commissioner may do so despite section 170 (Amendment of assessments) of the _Income Tax Assessment Act 1936_.

         * Note: This Subdivision is disregarded in calculating the attributable income of a CFC: see section 410 of the _Income Tax Assessment Act 1936_.

##### Australian permanent establishments of foreign financial entities

##### 170174  Treatment like Australian branches of foreign banks

    * (1) The object of this section is to let *net capital losses be transferred under this Subdivision to and from *Australian permanent establishments of *foreign entities that are *financial entities in the same way as net capital losses can be transferred to and from Australian branches of *foreign banks.

    * (2) This Subdivision (except this section) applies to an *Australian permanent establishment of a *foreign entity that is a *financial entity in the same way as this Subdivision applies to an Australian branch (as defined in Part IIIB of the _Income Tax Assessment Act 1936_) of a *foreign bank.

##### Subdivision 170C--Provisions applying to both transfers of tax losses and transfers of net capital losses within whollyowned groups of companies

##### Guide to Subdivision 170C

##### 170201  What this Subdivision is about

    * If a tax loss or a net capital loss is transferred between companies in the same whollyowned group, this Subdivision provides for adjustments to:

         * (a) the cost base and reduced cost base of direct and indirect equity interests held by group companies in the loss company, or in the income company or gain company; and

         * (b) the reduced cost base of direct and indirect debt interest held by group companies in the loss company; and

         * (c) the cost base and reduced cost base of direct and indirect debt interests held by group companies in the income company or gain company.

##### Table of sections

  * Operative provisions

      * 170205	Object of Subdivision

      *  170210	Transfer of tax loss: direct and indirect interests in the loss company

      *  170215	Transfer of tax loss: direct and indirect interests in the income company

      *  170220	Transfer of net capital loss: direct and indirect interests in the loss company

      *  170225	Transfer of net capital loss: direct and indirect interests in the gain company

##### Operative provisions

##### 170205  Object of Subdivision

    * Interests in the loss company

    * (1) The main object of this Subdivision is to ensure that, if an amount of a *tax loss or *net capital loss is transferred by a company to another company in the same *whollyowned group, the loss transferred is not duplicated by a member of the group.

    * (2) Duplication could occur by the making of a *capital loss, or the reduction of a *capital gain, from a *CGT event that happens in relation to an equity interest held (directly or indirectly) in the loss company or by the making of a capital loss in relation to a debt interest held (directly or indirectly) in the loss company.

    * Interests in the income company or gain company

    * (3) This Subdivision may also require an adjustment to the cost base and reduced cost base of an equity or debt interest held (directly or indirectly) by a group company in the income company or gain company.

    * (4) This adjustment is to reflect an increase in the *market value of the interest because of the transfer of the loss if the increase is still reflected in the market value of the interest when a *CGT event happens in relation to the interest.

##### 170210  Transfer of tax loss: direct and indirect interests in the loss company

    * (1) If:

     * (a) an amount of a *tax loss is transferred by a company to another company; and

     * (b) Subdivision 170A applies in respect of the transfer; and

     * (c) a company (the **_group company_**) holds a *share in the loss company or is owed a debt by the loss company in respect of a loan; and

     * (d) the group company *acquired the share or debt on or after 20 September 1985; and

     * (e) throughout the deduction year, the group company is a member of the same *whollyowned group as the loss company (disregarding a period when either was not in existence); and

     * (f) a *CGT event happens in relation to the share or debt on or after the commencement of this section; and

     * (g) the relevant agreement referred to in section 17050 is made on or after that commencement;

    * the *cost base and *reduced cost base of the share or the reduced cost base of the debt is reduced in accordance with subsection (3).

    * (2) If:

     * (a) an amount of a *tax loss is transferred by a company to another company; and

     * (b) Subdivision 170A applies in respect of the transfer; and

     * (c) a company (the **_group company_**) holds a *share in another company or is owed a debt by another company in respect of a loan; and

     * (d) the group company *acquired the share or debt on or after 20 September 1985; and

     * (e) the money that the group company paid for the share, or the borrowed money, has been applied (directly, or indirectly through one or more interposed entities):

       * (i) in the other company or a third company acquiring shares in the loss company; or

       * (ii) in a *borrowing by the loss company from the other company or from a third company; and

     * (f) throughout the deduction year, the group company, the other company and the third company (if any) are all members of the same *whollyowned group as the loss company (disregarding, for a particular company, a period when it was not in existence); and

     * (g) a *CGT event happens in relation to the share or debt on or after the commencement of this section; and

     * (h) the relevant agreement referred to in section 17050 is made on or after that commencement;

    * the *cost base and *reduced cost base of the share or the reduced cost base of the debt is reduced in accordance with subsection (3).

    * (3) The *cost base and *reduced cost base of the share or the reduced cost base of the debt is reduced by an amount that is appropriate having regard to:

     * (aa) the main object of this Subdivision and other matters mentioned in subsections 170205(1) and (2); and

     * (a) the group company's direct or indirect interest in the loss company; and

     * (ba) any reduction in the reduced cost base made under Subdivision 165CD; and

     * (b) the amount of the loss transferred; and

     * (c) the extent to which the loss reduced the *market value of the share or debt; and

     * (d) any consideration received by the loss company for the loss transferred; and

     * (e) whether, because of a dividend or dividends paid by the loss company, the consideration is no longer reflected (wholly or partly) in the market value of the share or debt when a *CGT event happens in relation to it.

    * (3A) To avoid doubt in applying paragraph (3)(c) in relation to a *share or debt, if factors other than the loss altered the *market value of the share or debt, the extent to which the loss reduced that market value is taken to be the extent to which that market value would have been reduced apart from those other factors.

         * Note: An example of a factor other than the loss is the unrealised value of assets (including assets in respect of which there is an unrealised gain) of the loss company, whether or not generated by outlays or economic losses reflected in the loss for income tax purposes.

    * (3B) This section applies to a *tax loss only to the extent that the loss represents an outlay or loss of any of the economic resources of the *loss company.

         * Note: Where the income tax law allows, as all or part of a loss, an amount for the decline in value of a depreciating asset that exceeds the actual economic depreciation or depletion of the asset concerned, the excess is not to be regarded for the purposes of this subsection as representing an outlay or loss of economic resources of the company.

    * (4) Any reduction is to be made immediately before a *CGT event happens in relation to the share or debt and is to have effect from that time or the end of the deduction year, whichever is the earlier.

         * Note 1: For **_deduction year_** see subsection 17020(1).

         * Note 2: Subsection (4) is relevant for indexing elements of a cost base (see sections 1141 and 11415).

     * (e) throughout the deduction year, the group company is a member of the same *whollyowned group as the income company (disregarding a period when either was not in existence); and

     * (f) a *CGT event happens in relation to the share or debt on or after the commencement of this section; and

     * (g) the relevant agreement referred to in section 17050 is made on or after that commencement; and

     * (h) there are shares in, or debts owed by, the *loss company the *reduced cost base of at least one of which has been reduced by subsection 170210(1) or (2);

    * the *cost base and *reduced cost base of the share or debt are increased in accordance with subsection (3).

    * (2) If:

     * (a) an amount of a *tax loss is transferred by a company to another company; and

     * (b) Subdivision 170A applies in respect of the transfer; and

     * (c) a company (the **_group company_**) holds a *share in another company or is owed a debt by another company in respect of a loan; and

     * (d) the group company *acquired the share or debt on or after 20 September 1985; and

     * (e) the money that the group company paid for the share, or the borrowed money, has been applied (directly, or indirectly through one or more interposed entities):

       * (i) in the other company or a third company acquiring shares in the income company; or

       * (ii) in a *borrowing by the income company from the other company or from a third company; and

     * (f) throughout the deduction year, the group company, the other company and the third company (if any) are all members of the same *whollyowned group as the income company (disregarding, for a particular company, a period when it was not in existence); and

     * (g) a *CGT event happens in relation to the share or debt on or after the commencement of this section; and

     * (h) the relevant agreement referred to in section 17050 is made on or after that commencement; and

     * (i) there are shares in, or debts owed by, the *loss company the *reduced cost base of at least one of which has been reduced by subsection 170210(1) or (2);

    * the *cost base and *reduced cost base of the share or debt are increased in accordance with subsection (3).

    * (3) The *cost base and *reduced cost base are increased by an amount that is appropriate having regard to:

     * (aa) the matters mentioned in subsections 170205(3) and (4); and

     * (ab) the amounts of any reductions to the cost base and reduced cost base of *shares, and to the reduced cost base of debts, under subsection 170210(3); and

     * (b) the amount of the loss transferred; and

     * (c) any consideration given by the income company for the loss transferred.

    * (4) However, the increase cannot exceed the increase in the *market value of the *share or debt that results from the transfer of the loss. (If no increase in that market value results, for example because the consideration paid for the transfer of the loss equals the commercial value of the loss transferred, then there is no increase in the *cost base and *reduced cost base.)

    * (4A) No increase is to be made to the extent that the *tax loss transferred does not represent an outlay or loss of any of the economic resources of the company that transferred the tax loss.

         * Note: Where the income tax law allows, as all or part of a loss, an amount for the decline in value of a depreciating asset that exceeds the actual economic depreciation or depletion of the asset concerned, the excess is not to be regarded for the purposes of this subsection as representing an outlay or loss of economic resources of the company.

    * (5) Any increase is to be made immediately before a *CGT event happens in relation to the share or debt and is to have effect from that time or the end of the deduction year, whichever is the earlier.

    * (6) No increase is to be made to the *cost base and *reduced cost base of a share or debt to the extent to which, because of a dividend or dividends paid by the income company, the increase in the *market value of the share or debt that resulted from the transfer of the loss is no longer in existence at the time when a *CGT event happens in relation to the share or debt.

         * Note: For **_deduction year_** see subsection 17020(1).

##### Subdivision 170D--Transactions by a company that is a member of a linked group

##### Guide to Subdivision 170D

##### 170250  What this Subdivision is about

    * This Subdivision provides that there is a deferral of a *capital loss or deduction if a company (the **_originating company_**) that is a member of a *linked group disposes of a *CGT asset to, or creates a CGT asset in, another entity that:

         * (a) is a company that is also a member of the linked group; or

         * (b) is a connected entity of the originating company or an *associate of such a connected entity;

    * and the disposal or creation of the asset would have resulted in the originating company making a capital loss or becoming entitled to a deduction.

     * (a) the amount remaining after applying Division 723 or section 727615; or

     * (b) nil, if none of the amount remains after applying that section or Division.

         * Note: Division 723 and section 727615 reduce a loss realised for income tax purposes by a realisation event happening to a nondepreciating asset (in the case of Division 723) or an affected interest in a losing entity under an indirect value shift (in the case of section 727615).

##### 170275  Subsequent consequences for originating company

       * (i) a member of the *linked group of which the originating company is a member;

       * (ii) a connected entity of the originating company;

       * (iii) an *associate of such a connected entity;

     * (c) if the relevant CGT asset is acquired by a company that is a member of that linked group--that company ceases to be a member of that linked group;

     * (d) the originating company ceases to be a member of that linked group;

     * (e) if the relevant CGT asset is acquired by an entity that is a connected entity of the originating company or is an associate of such a connected entity--that entity ceases to be such a connected entity or ceases to be an associate of such a connected entity, as the case may be;

    * the originating company is taken, immediately before the time of the happening of the new event or the earliest of the new events, as the case may be, to have made a *capital loss equal to the amount of the capital loss referred to in section 170270 or to have become entitled to a deduction equal to the deduction, or the share of the deduction, referred to in that section, as the case may be.

    * (2) If the *capital loss referred to in section 170270 would have been made from a *personal use asset or from a *collectable, any corresponding capital loss that the originating company is taken by subsection (1) of this section to have made is taken to have been made from a personal use asset or from a collectable, as the case may be.

##### 170280  What happens if certain events happen in respect of the asset

    * (1) This section applies if, as a result of the occurrence of a new event in respect of a *CGT asset, the originating company is taken by subsection 170275(1) to have made a *capital loss or to be entitled to a deduction and, within 4 years after the occurrence of the new event, one of the following events (**_further events_**) occurs:

     * (a) the asset or a greater than 50% interest in it is *acquired by the originating company or by an entity that, at the time of the acquisition, is:

       * (i) a company that is a member of the *linked group of which the originating company is a member; or

       * (ii) a connected entity of the originating company; or

       * (iii) an *associate of such a connected entity;

     * (b) a company that owns the asset or a greater than 50% interest in it becomes a member of the linked group of which the originating company is a member;

     * (c) the originating company becomes a member of a linked group another member of which owns the asset or a greater than 50% interest in it;

     * (d) an entity that owns the asset or a greater than 50% interest in it becomes:

       * (i) a connected entity of the originating company; or

       * (ii) an associate of such a connected entity.

    * (1A) If the originating company has information from which it would be reasonable to conclude that, if the *CGT asset involved were owned by the originating company immediately after the further event, *majority underlying interests in the asset immediately after the further event would not have been had by *ultimate owners who had majority underlying interests in the asset immediately before the deferral event, the further event is taken not to have occurred.

    * (2) The company is taken not to have made the *capital loss or not to have been entitled to the deduction, as the case may be.

    * (3) If, at a time after the further event, any one or more of the following events (the **_realisation events_**) happens:

     * (a) the *CGT asset referred to in subsection (1) (the **_relevant CGT asset_**), or a greater than 50% interest in it, ceases to exist;

     * (b) the relevant CGT asset, or a greater than 50% interest in it, is *acquired by an entity that is none of the following:

       * (i) a member of the linked group of which the originating company is a member;

       * (ii) a connected entity of the originating company;

       * (iii) an *associate of such a connected entity;

     * (c) if the relevant CGT asset is acquired by a company that is a member of that linked group--that company ceases to be a member of that linked group;

     * (d) the originating company ceases to be a member of that linked group;

     * (e) if the relevant CGT asset is acquired by an entity that is a connected entity of the originating company or is an associate of such a connected entity--that entity ceases to be such a connected entity or ceases to be an associate of such a connected entity, as the case may be;

    * the originating company is taken, immediately before the time of the happening of the realisation event or the earliest of the realisation events, as the case may be , to have made a *capital loss equal to the amount of the capital loss referred to in subsection (2) or to have become entitled to a deduction equal to the deduction referred to in that subsection, as the case may be.

    * (4) If the *capital loss referred to in subsection (2) would have been made from a *personal use asset or from a *collectable, any corresponding capital loss that the originating company is taken by subsection (3) to have made is taken to have been made from a personal use asset or from a collectable, as the case may be.

##### 1751  What this Division is about

    * The Commissioner can reverse the effect of schemes that, in order to avoid tax, bring together in the same company:

     * assessable income; and

     * tax losses, current year deductions, or deductions for bad debts, that apart from the scheme would not be fully used.

      *  17510	First case: income or capital gain injected into company because of available tax loss

      *  17515	Second case: someone else obtains a tax benefit because of tax loss available to company

##### 1755  When Commissioner can disallow deduction for tax loss

    * (1) This Subdivision sets out cases where the Commissioner may disallow some or all of a *tax loss (or of part of a tax loss) (the **_excluded loss_**) as a deduction in calculating a company's taxable income of an income year after the *loss year.

    * (2) However, the Commissioner cannot disallow the *excluded loss if the company:

     * (a) fails to meet a condition in section 16512 (which is about the company maintaining the same owners) in respect of the *loss year or the income year; but

     * (b) meets the condition in section 16513 (which is about the company satisfying the same business test) in respect of the income year.

##### 17510  First case: income or capital gain injected into company because of available tax loss

    * (1) The Commissioner may disallow the *excluded loss if, during the income year, the company *derived assessable income, or a *capital gain accrued to the company, some or all of which (the **_injected amount_**) would not have been derived, or would not have accrued, if the excluded loss had not been available to be taken into account for the purposes of:

      *  	Division 36 (which is about tax losses of earlier years);

      *  	Division 165 (which is about the income tax consequences of changing ownership or control of a company);

      *  	former Subdivision 375G (which is about film losses).

    * (2) However, the Commissioner cannot disallow the *excluded loss if the *continuing shareholders will benefit from the derivation or accrual of the *injected amount to an extent that the Commissioner thinks fair and reasonable having regard to their respective rights and interests in the company.

         * Note: Section 175100 allows the Commissioner to disallow an excluded loss of an insolvent company.

    * (3) The **_continuing shareholders_** are:

     * (a) all of the persons who had *more than 50% of the voting power in the company during the whole (or the relevant part) of the *loss year and during the whole of the income year; and

     * (b) all of the persons who had rights to *more than 50% of the company's dividends during the whole (or the relevant part) of the loss year and during the whole of the income year; and

     * (c) all of the persons who had rights to *more than 50% of the company's capital distributions during the whole (or the relevant part) of the loss year and during the whole of the income year.

    * To find out who they were, apply whichever tests are applied in order to determine whether the company can deduct the *tax loss (or the part of the tax loss) in the first place.

         * See section 16512 (which is about the company maintaining the same owners).

##### 17515  Second case: someone else obtains a tax benefit because of tax loss available to company

    * (1) The Commissioner may disallow the *excluded loss if:

     * (a) a person has obtained or will obtain a tax benefit in connection with a *scheme; and

     * (b) the scheme would not have been entered into or carried out if the excluded loss had not been available to be taken into account for the purposes of:

       *  	Division 36 (which is about tax losses of earlier years);

       *  	Division 165 (which is about the income tax consequences of changing ownership or control of a company);

       *  	former Subdivision 375G (which is about film losses).

    * (2) However, the Commissioner cannot disallow the *excluded loss if:

     * (a) the person had a *shareholding interest in the company at some time during the income year; and 

     * (b) the Commissioner considers the tax benefit to be fair and reasonable having regard to that shareholding interest.

         * Note: Section 175100 allows the Commissioner to disallow an excluded loss of an insolvent company.

    * (3) An expression means the same in this section as in Part IVA of the _Income Tax Assessment Act 1936_.

     * (b) the income was derived, or the capital gain accrued, in that income year.

    * The disallowed deductions and parts of deductions may exceed the *injected amount.

         * Note: The disallowance may result in a tax loss for the income year. See section 17535.

    * (2) The Commissioner cannot disallow the deductions or parts of the deductions if the *continuing shareholders will benefit from the derivation of the *injected amount to an extent that the Commissioner thinks fair and reasonable having regard to their respective *shareholding interests in the company.

         * Note: Section 175100 allows the Commissioner to disallow the whole or part of any deductions of an insolvent company.

    * (3) The **_continuing shareholders_** are the individuals who had *shareholding interests in the company both immediately before the *injected amount was *derived, and immediately afterwards.

##### 17525  Deduction injected into company because of available income or capital gain

    * (1) The Commissioner may disallow a deduction of a company for an income year to the extent that the company would not have incurred the loss, outgoing or expenditure that the deduction is for if it had not *derived some or all of the assessable income it derived in that income year, or had not made some or all of a *capital gain it made in that income year.

         * Note: The disallowance may result in a tax loss for the income year. See section 17535.

    * (2) The Commissioner cannot disallow any of the deduction if:

     * (a) the *continuing shareholders will benefit from any profit or advantage that has arisen or might arise directly or indirectly from the loss, outgoing or expenditure being incurred; and

     * (b) the Commissioner thinks that the extent to which they will benefit is fair and reasonable having regard to their respective *shareholding interests in the company.

         * Note: Section 175100 allows the Commissioner to disallow a deduction of an insolvent company.

    * (3) The **_continuing shareholders_** are the individuals who had *shareholding interests in the company both immediately before the loss, outgoing or expenditure was incurred, and immediately afterwards.

##### 17530  Someone else obtains a tax benefit because of a deduction, income or capital gain available to company

    * (1) The Commissioner may disallow a deduction of a company if:

     * (a) a person (other than the company) has obtained or will obtain a tax benefit in connection with a *scheme; and

     * (b) the scheme would not have been entered into or carried out if the company had not incurred some or all (the **_available expense_**) of the loss, outgoing or expenditure that the deduction is for. 

    * However, the deduction may be disallowed only to the extent of the available expense.

    * (2) The Commissioner may disallow deductions of a company (or parts of them) if:

     * (a) a person has obtained or will obtain a tax benefit in connection with a *scheme; and

     * (b) the scheme would not have been entered into or carried out if some or all (the **_available amount_**) of the assessable income that the company *derived or of a *capital gain that accrued to the company:

       * (i) before it incurred the losses, outgoings or expenditure that the deductions were for; and

       * (ii) in the same income year as it incurred them;

     * had not been derived or had not accrued, as the case may be.

    * The disallowed deductions and parts of deductions may exceed the available amount.

         * Note: The disallowance may result in a tax loss for the income year. See section 17535.

    * (3) An expression means the same in this section as in Part IVA of the _Income Tax Assessment Act 1936_.

    * (4) The Commissioner cannot disallow under this section if:

     * (a) the person who has obtained or will obtain the tax benefit had a *shareholding interest in the company at some time during the income year; and 

     * (b) the Commissioner considers the tax benefit to be fair and reasonable having regard to that shareholding interest.

         * Note: Section 175100 allows the Commissioner to disallow the whole or part of any deductions of an insolvent company.

##### 17535  Tax loss resulting from disallowed deductions

    * (1) If a company has a taxable income for an income year because the Commissioner disallows under this Subdivision deductions of the company for the income year (or parts of them), the company may also have a *tax loss for the income year.

    * (2) The company's **_tax loss_** for the income year is calculated as follows.

    * (3) Total what the Commissioner has disallowed under this Subdivision.

    * (4) If the company has *exempt income for the income year, subtract its *net exempt income.

    * (5) Any amount remaining is the company's **_tax loss_** for the income year, which is called a **_loss year_**.

         * Note: The meanings of **_tax loss_** and **_loss year_** are modified by section 3655 for a corporate tax entity that has an amount of excess franking offsets.

         * To find out _how much_ of the tax loss can be deducted in later income years: see Subdivision 165A.

##### Table of sections

      * 17540	When Commissioner can disallow net capital loss of earlier income year

      *  17545	First case: capital gain injected into company because of available net capital loss

      *  17550	Second case: someone else obtains a tax benefit because of net capital loss available to company

##### 17540  When Commissioner can disallow net capital loss of earlier income year

    * (1) This Subdivision sets out cases where the Commissioner may prevent a company, in working out its *net capital gain for an income year, from applying some or all of a *net capital loss it has for an earlier income year (or of part of one) (the **_excluded loss_**). This is called **_disallowing_** the excluded loss.

         * Note: A company's net capital gain for an income year is usually worked out under section 1025.

    * (2) However, the Commissioner cannot *disallow the *excluded loss if, in determining (under section 16596) whether Subdivision 165A would prevent the company from deducting the loss (or the part of the loss) for the income year if the loss were a *tax loss of the company for that earlier income year, the company:

     * (a) would fail to meet a condition in section 16512 (which is about the company maintaining the same owners) in respect of the income year; but

     * (b) would meet the condition in section 16513 (which is about the company satisfying the same business test) in respect of the income year.

         * Note: Subdivision 165A deals with the deductibility of a company's tax loss for an earlier income year if there has been a change in the ownership or control of the company in the period from the start of the loss year to the end of the income year.

##### 17545  First case: capital gain injected into company because of available net capital loss

    * (1) The Commissioner may *disallow the *excluded loss if, during the income year, the company made a *capital gain some or all of which (the **_injected capital gain_**) it would not have made if the excluded loss had not been available to be applied in working out the company's *net capital gain for the income year (or for some other income year).

    * (2) However, the Commissioner cannot *disallow the *excluded loss if the *continuing shareholders will benefit from the making of the injected capital gain to an extent that the Commissioner thinks fair and reasonable having regard to their respective rights and interests in the company.

         * Note: Section 175100 allows the Commissioner to disallow an excluded loss of an insolvent company.

    * (3) The **_continuing shareholders_** are:

     * (a) all of the persons who had *more than 50% of the voting power in the company during the whole (or the relevant part) of the earlier income year and during the whole of the income year; and

     * (b) all of the persons who had rights to *more than 50% of the company's dividends during the whole (or the relevant part) of the earlier income year and during the whole of the income year; and

     * (c) all of the persons who had rights to *more than 50% of the company's capital distributions during the whole (or the relevant part) of the earlier income year and during the whole of the income year.

    * To find out who they were, apply whichever tests are applied in order to determine (under section 16596) whether Subdivision 165A would prevent the company from deducting the loss for the current year if it were a *tax loss of the company for that earlier income year.

         * See section 16512 (which is about the company maintaining the same owners).

##### 17550  Second case: someone else obtains a tax benefit because of net capital loss available to company

    * (1) The Commissioner may *disallow the *excluded loss if:

     * (a) a person has obtained or will obtain a tax benefit in connection with a *scheme; and

     * (b) the scheme would not have been entered into or carried out if the excluded loss had not been available to be applied in working out the company's *net capital gain for the income year (or for some other income year).

    * (2) However, the Commissioner cannot *disallow the *excluded loss if:

     * (a) the person had a *shareholding interest in the company at some time during the income year; and 

     * (b) the Commissioner considers the tax benefit to be fair and reasonable having regard to that shareholding interest.

         * Note: Section 175100 allows the Commissioner to disallow an excluded loss of an insolvent company.

    * (3) An expression means the same in this section as in Part IVA of the _Income Tax Assessment Act 1936_.

         * Note: The disallowance may result in a net capital loss for the income year: see section 17575.

    * (2) The Commissioner cannot *disallow the *capital losses or parts of the capital losses if the *continuing shareholders will benefit from the making of the injected capital gain to an extent that the Commissioner thinks fair and reasonable having regard to their respective *shareholding interests in the company.

         * Note: Section 175100 allows the Commissioner to disallow capital losses or parts of capital losses of an insolvent company.

    * (3) The **_continuing shareholders_** are the individuals who had *shareholding interests in the company both immediately before the *injected capital gain was made, and immediately afterwards.

##### 17565  Capital loss injected into company because of available capital gain

    * (1) The Commissioner may *disallow a *capital loss of a company for an income year to the extent that the company would not have made the loss if it had not also made some or all of a *capital gain it made in that income year.

     * (b) the scheme would not have been entered into or carried out if the company had not made some or all (the **_available capital loss_**) of the capital loss. 

    * However, the capital loss may be disallowed only to the extent of the available capital loss.

    * (2) The Commissioner may *disallow *capital losses of a company (or parts of them) if:

     * (a) a person has obtained or will obtain a tax benefit in connection with a *scheme; and

    * exceeds the total capital contributions amount described in whichever of subsections (3) and (4) applies, subsection (1) does not stop this Division from applying to so much of the transferred amount as equals the lesser of the transferred amount and the amount of the excess.

         * Note: If there are several transfers of amounts to the company's share capital account in connection with the demutualisation, this section must be applied separately in relation to each transferred amount, in the order in which the transfers are made.

     * (d) the company (the **_issuing company_**) to whose *share capital account the amount is transferred is:

       * (i) if the demutualisation method is the method specified in section 121AF or 121AG of the _Income Tax Assessment Act 1936_--the demutualising company; or

       * (ii) if the demutualisation method is the method specified in section 121AH, 121AI, 121AJ, 121AK or 121AL of the _Income Tax Assessment Act 1936_--the company issuing the ordinary shares referred to in that section.

    * exceeds the listing day company valuation amount (see subsection (3)), subsection (1) does not stop this Division from applying to so much of the transferred amount as equals the lesser of the transferred amount and the amount of the excess.

         * Note: If there are several transfers of amounts to the share capital account of the demutualised company or the issuing company, this section must be applied separately in relation to each transferred amount, in the order in which the transfers are made.

    * (3) The **_listing day company valuation amount _**has the same meaning as it has for the purposes of table 1 in section 121AS of the _Income Tax Assessment Act 1936_, as that table applies in relation to the demutualised company (see note 3 to that table).

##### 19742  Exclusion for exploration credits

##### Subdivision 197B--Consequence of transfer: franking debit arises

##### Table of sections

      * 19745	A franking debit arises in relation to the transfer

##### 19745  A franking debit arises in relation to the transfer

    * (1) A *franking debit arises in a company's *franking account if an amount (the **_transferred amount_**) to which this Division applies is transferred to the company's *share capital account. The debit arises immediately before the end of the *franking period in which the transfer of the amount occurs.

    * (2) The amount of the *franking debit is calculated in accordance with the formula:

    * where: 

    * **_applicable franking percentage _**means:

     * (a) if, before the debit arises, the *benchmark franking percentage for the *franking period in which the transfer of the amount occurs has already been set by section 20330--that percentage; or

     * (b) otherwise--100%.

##### Subdivision 197C--Consequence of transfer: tainting of share capital account

##### Table of sections

      * 19750	The share capital account becomes tainted (if it is not already tainted)

      * 19755	Choosing to untaint a tainted share capital account

      * 19760	Choosing to untaint--liability to untainting tax

      * 19765	Choosing to untaint--further franking debits may arise

      * 19770	Due date for payment of untainting tax

      * 19775	General interest charge for late payment of untainting tax

      * 19780	Notice of liability to pay untainting tax

      * 19785	Evidentiary effect of notice of liability to pay untainting tax

##### 19750  The share capital account becomes tainted (if it is not already tainted)

    * (1) A company's *share capital account becomes **_tainted_** when an amount to which this Division applies is transferred to the account, if, at the time of the transfer, the account is not already tainted (because of the application of this section in relation to a previous transfer).

         * Note: If a company's share capital account is tainted, then a distribution from the account is taxed as a dividend in the hands of the shareholder. This is because a tainted share capital account does not count as a share capital account for the purposes of paragraph (d) of the definition of **_dividend_** in subsection 6(1) of the _Income Tax Assessment Act 1936_ (see subsection 975300(3) of this Act). However, although the distribution is taxed as a dividend, the company cannot pass on to the shareholder the benefit of the tax it has paid, because a distribution from a share capital account (whether or not tainted) is unfrankable (see paragraphs 20245(e) and 975300(3)(ba) of this Act).

    * (2) The *share capital account remains **_tainted_** until the company chooses to untaint the account (see section 19755).

         * Note: If, after a choice to untaint is made, the company's share capital account becomes tainted again, the account remains tainted until a fresh choice to untaint is made.

    * (3) The **_tainting amount_**, for a company's *share capital account that is *tainted at a particular time, means the sum of:

     * (a) the amount transferred to the company's share capital account that most recently caused the account to become tainted; and

     * (b) any other amounts to which this Division applies that have been transferred to the company's share capital account since the transfer referred to in paragraph (a) and before the particular time.

##### 19755  Choosing to untaint a tainted share capital account

    * (1) A company with a *share capital account that is *tainted may make a choice in the *approved form given to the Commissioner to untaint the account.

    * (2) The choice can be made at any time, but cannot be revoked.

         * Note: The choice has no effect in relation to a subsequent tainting of the share capital account that occurs after the choice is made.

##### 19760  Choosing to untaint--liability to untainting tax

    * Definitions

    * (1) For the purpose of this section:

     * (a) a company whose *share capital account is *tainted is a **_company with only lower tax members in relation to the tainting period_** if, throughout the tainting period, all *members of the company were covered by one, or a combination of 2 or more, of the following subparagraphs:

       * (i) other companies;

       * (ii) *complying superannuation entities;

       * (iii) foreign residents; and

     * (b) a company whose share capital account is tainted is a **_company with higher tax members in relation to the tainting period_** if it is not a company with only lower tax members in relation to the tainting period.

    * For this purpose, the **_tainting period _**is the period beginning when the share capital account most recently became tainted and ending when the company chooses to untaint the account.

    * Liability to untainting tax

    * (2) A company that chooses to untaint its *share capital account is liable to pay tax, known as **_untainting tax_**, equal to the amount calculated in accordance with the formula:

    * where: 

    * **_applicable tax amount _**has the meaning given by subsection (3).

    * **_section 19745 franking debits _**means the total *franking debits arising under section 19745 because of the transfer of the amounts that made up the *tainting amount at the time of the choice.

    * **_section 19765 franking debits _**means the total (if any) *franking debits arising under section 19765 because of the choice to untaint.

         * Note: The payment of untainting tax does not give rise to a franking credit.

    * (3) In subsection (2), the **_applicable tax amount_** is the amount calculated in accordance with the formula:

    * where: 

    * **_applicable tax rate _**means:

     * (a) for a company with only lower tax members in relation to the tainting period--the *standard corporate tax rate; or

     * (b) for a company with higher tax members in relation to the tainting period--the sum of:

       * (i) the maximum rate specified in column 2 of the table in Part I of Schedule 7 to the _Income Tax Rates Act 1986_ that applies for the income year in which the choice is made; and

       * (ii) 3%.

         * Note: The 3% referred to in subparagraph (b)(ii) relates to rates of Medicare levy and surcharge.

    * **_notional franking amount _**has the meaning given by subsection (4).

    * (4) In subsection (3), the **_notional franking amount_** is the amount calculated in accordance with the formula:

    * Temporary budget repair levy

    * (5) If the income year in which the choice is made corresponds to a temporary budget repair levy year (within the meaning of section 411 of the _Income Tax (Transitional Provisions) Act 1997_), increase the applicable tax rate calculated under subsection (3) by 2 percentage points.

##### 19765  Choosing to untaint--further franking debits may arise

    * When this section applies

    * (1) This section applies if:

     * (a) a company chooses to untaint its *share capital account; and

     * (b) the applicable franking percentage (within the meaning of subsection (3)) is higher than the percentage that was the *benchmark franking percentage in relation to the *franking period in which the transfer of an amount (the **_transferred amount_**) that is, or is part of, the *tainting amount occurred.

         * Note: If paragraph (b) is satisfied in relation to 2 or more amounts, this section is to be applied separately in relation to each of those amounts (so a separate franking debit will arise in relation to each of those amounts).

    * Franking debit arises in relation to making the choice

    * (2) A *franking debit arises in the company's *franking account in relation to the transferred amount. The debit arises immediately before the end of the *franking period in which the choice to untaint is made.

    * (3) The amount of the *franking debit is the amount by which the amount calculated in accordance with the following formula exceeds the amount of the franking debit that arose under section 19745 in relation to the transferred amount:

    * where: 

    * **_applicable franking percentage _**means:

     * (a) if, before the debit arises, the *benchmark franking percentage for the *franking period in which the choice to untaint is made has already been set by section 20330--that percentage; or

     * (b) otherwise--100%.

##### 19770  Due date for payment of untainting tax

    * *Untainting tax is due and payable at the end of 21 days after the end of the *franking period in which the choice to untaint was made.

         * Note: For provisions about collection and recovery of untainting tax, see Part 415 in Schedule 1 to the _Taxation Administration Act 1953_.

##### 19775  General interest charge for late payment of untainting tax

    * If any of the *untainting tax that a company is liable to pay remains unpaid 60 days after the day by which it is due to be paid, the company is liable to pay the *general interest charge on the unpaid amount for each day in the period that:

     * (a) started at the beginning of the 60th day after the day by which the untainting tax was due to be paid; and

     * (b) ends at the end of the last day on which, at the end of the day, any of the following remains unpaid:

       * (i) the untainting tax;

       * (ii) general interest charge on any of the untainting tax.

##### 19780  Notice of liability to pay untainting tax

    * (1) The Commissioner may give a company, by post or otherwise, a notice specifying:

     * (a) the amount of any *untainting tax that the Commissioner has ascertained is payable by the company; and

     * (b) the day on which that tax became or will become due and payable.

    * Effect of notice on liability etc.

    * (2) Subject to section 19785, the amount of the liability of a company to *untainting tax, and the due date for payment of the tax, are not dependent on, or in any way affected by, the giving of a notice.

    * Amendment of notice

    * (3) The Commissioner may at any time amend a notice. An amended notice is a notice for the purposes of this section.

    * Inconsistency between notices

    * (4) If there is an inconsistency between notices that relate to the same subject matter, the later notice prevails to the extent of the inconsistency.

    * Objections

    * (5) A company that is dissatisfied with a notice made in relation to the company may object against the notice in the manner set out in Part IVC of the _Taxation Administration Act 1953_.

##### 19785  Evidentiary effect of notice of liability to pay untainting tax

    * (1) The production of:

     * (a) a notice given under section 19780; or

     * (b) a document that is signed by the Commissioner and appears to be a copy of such a notice;

    * is conclusive evidence that: 

     * (c) the notice was duly given; and

     * (d) the amount of *untainting tax specified in the notice became due and payable by the company to which it was given on the day specified in the notice.

    * (2) Subsection (1) does not apply in proceedings under Part IVC of the _Taxation Administration Act 1953_ on a review or appeal relating to the review.

### Part 36--The imputation system

##### 2001  What this Division is about

    * This Division provides an overview of the imputation system.

##### Table of sections

      * 2005	The imputation system

      * 20010	Franking a distribution

      * 20015	The franking account

      * 20020	How a distribution is franked

      * 20040	An Australian corporate tax entity can pass the benefit of having received a franked distribution on to its members

      * 20045	Special rules for franking by some entities

##### 2005  The imputation system

    * The *imputation system partially integrates the income tax liabilities of an Australian corporate tax entity and its members by:

     * (a) allowing the entity, when distributing profits to its members, to pass to those members credit for income tax paid by the entity on those profits; and

     * (b) allowing the entity's Australian members to claim a tax offset for that credit; and

     * (c) allowing the entity's Australian members to claim a refund if they are unable to fully utilise the tax offset in reducing their income tax.

##### 20010  Franking a distribution

    * When an Australian corporate tax entity distributes profits to its members, the entity has the option of passing to those members credit for income tax paid by the entity on the profits. This is done by franking the distribution.

##### 20015  The franking account

    * (1) A franking account is used to keep track of income tax paid by the entity, so that the entity can pass to its members the benefit of having paid that tax when a distribution is made.

    * (2) Each corporate tax entity has a franking account.

    * (3) Typically, a corporate tax entity receives a credit in the account if the entity pays income tax or receives a franked distribution. A credit in the franking account is called a franking credit.

    * (4) Typically, a corporate tax entity receives a debit in the account if the entity receives a refund of tax or franks a distribution to its members. A debit in the franking account is called a franking debit.

##### 20020  How a distribution is franked

    * (1) A corporate tax entity franks a distribution by allocating a franking credit to it.

    * (2) The amount of the franking credit on the distribution is the amount specified in a statement that accompanies the distribution.

    * (3) Only some kinds of distribution can be franked. These are called frankable distributions.

##### 20025  A corporate tax entity must not give its members credit for more tax than the entity has paid

    * (1) A corporate tax entity must not frank a distribution from profits with a franking credit that exceeds the maximum amount of income tax that could have been paid, at the standard corporate tax rate, on the profits distributed.

    * (2) If a distribution is franked in excess of this limit, the entity will be taken to have franked the distribution with the maximum franking credit for the distribution.

##### 20030  Benchmark rule

    * (1) All frankable distributions made within a particular period must be franked to the same extent. This is the benchmark rule.

    * (2) It is designed to ensure that one member of a corporate tax entity is not preferred over another by the manner in which distributions are franked.

##### 20035  Effect of receiving a franked distribution

    * (1) Under Division 207, if an Australian member of a corporate tax entity receives a franked distribution, the member can usually offset, against the member's own income tax liability, income tax paid by the entity on the profits underlying the distribution.

    * (2) The tax offset to which the member is entitled is equal to the franking credit on the distribution.

         * Note 1: A member may be entitled to a refund under Division 67 if the sum of the tax offset and certain other tax offsets exceeds the amount of income tax that the member would have to pay if the member had not got those tax offsets.

         * Note 2: If the member is not a resident, the tax effects of receiving a distribution will be dealt with under Division 11A of Part III of the _Income Tax Assessment Act 1936_, and Subdivision 207D of this Part.

##### 20040  An Australian corporate tax entity can pass the benefit of having received a franked distribution on to its members

    * If an Australian corporate tax entity receives a franked distribution, it can pass the benefit of having received a franking credit on the distribution to its own members by franking distributions to those members.

##### 20045  Special rules for franking by some entities

    * There are special rules to deal with: 

     * (a) venture capital franking by a pooled development fund; and

     * (b) franking by life insurance companies; and

     * (c) franking by exempting companies and former exempting companies; and

     * (d) franking by cooperative companies; and

     * (e) franking by companies that are NZ residents or members of the same whollyowned group as one or more companies that are NZ residents.

##### Operative provisions

##### 2025  Franking a distribution

    * An entity **_franks_** a *distribution if:

     * (a) the entity is a *franking entity that satisfies the *residency requirement when the distribution is made; and

     * (b) the distribution is a *frankable distribution; and

     * (c) the entity allocates a *franking credit to the distribution.

         * Note 1: Division 205 deals with a corporate tax entity's franking account and sets out when credits, known as franking credits, and debits, known as franking debits, arise in that account.

         * Note 2: The mechanism by which an entity allocates a franking credit to a distribution (for example, whether it is done by resolution or some other means) is determined by the entity.

##### Subdivision 202B--Who can frank a distribution?

##### Guide to Subdivision 202B

##### 20210  What this Subdivision is about

    * Generally, a corporate tax entity that is an Australian resident at the time a distribution is made, can frank the distribution.

    * There are some exceptions.

##### Table of sections

      * 20220	Residency requirement when making a distribution

##### Operative provisions

##### 20215  Franking entities

    * An entity is a **_franking entity _**at a particular time if:

     * (a) it is a *corporate tax entity at that time; and

     * (b) it is not a *life insurance company that is a *mutual insurance company at that time; and

     * (c) in a case where the entity is a company that is a trustee of a trust--it is not acting in its capacity as trustee of the trust at that time.

##### 20230  Frankable distributions

    * Distributions and nonshare dividends are frankable unless it is specified that they are unfrankable.

##### Operative provisions

##### 20235  Object

    * The object of this Subdivision is to ensure that only distributions equivalent to realised taxed profits can be franked.

##### 20240  Frankable distributions

    * (1) A *distribution is a **_frankable distribution_**, to the extent that it is not unfrankable under section 20245.

    * (2) A *nonshare dividend is a **_frankable distribution_**, to the extent that it is not unfrankable under section 20245.

##### 20245  Unfrankable distributions

    * The following are **_unfrankable_**:

     * (b) a distribution to which paragraph 24J(2)(a) of the _Income Tax Assessment Act 1936_ applies that is taken under section 24J of the _Income Tax Assessment Act 1936_ to be *derived from sources in a prescribed Territory, as defined in subsection 24B(1) of the _Income Tax Assessment Act 1936_ (distributions by certain *corporate tax entities from sources in Norfolk Island);

     * (c) where the purchase price on the buyback of a *share by a *company from one of its *members is taken to be a dividend under section 159GZZZP of that Act--so much of that purchase price as exceeds what would be the market value (as normally understood) of the share at the time of the buyback if the buyback did not take place and were never proposed to take place;

     * (d) a distribution in respect of a *nonequity share;

     * (e) a distribution that is sourced, directly or indirectly, from a company's *share capital account;

     * (f) an amount that is taken to be an unfrankable distribution under section 21510 or 21515;

     * (g) an amount that is taken to be a dividend for any purpose under any of the following provisions:

       * (i) unless subsection 109RB(6) or 109RC(2) applies in relation to the amount--Division 7A of Part III of that Act (distributions to entities connected with a *private company);

       * (iii) section 109 of that Act (excessive payments to shareholders, directors and associates);

       * (iv) section 47A of that Act (distribution benefits--CFCs);

     * (h) an amount that is taken to be an unfranked dividend for any purpose:

       * (i) under section 45 of that Act (streaming bonus shares and unfranked dividends);

       * (ii) because of a determination of the Commissioner under section 45C of that Act (streaming dividends and capital benefits);

     * (i) a *demerger dividend;

     * (j) a distribution that section 152125 or 220105 says is unfrankable.

##### 20247  Distributions of certain ADI profits following restructure

    * (1) This section applies to an amount paid by a body corporate if:

     * (a) the body corporate is a nonoperating holding company within the meaning of the _Financial Sector (Business Transfer and Group Restructure) Act 1999_; and

     * (b) a restructure instrument under Part 4A of that Act is in force in relation to the body; and

     * (c) because of the restructure to which the instrument relates, an *ADI becomes a subsidiary (within the meaning of that Act) of the body; and

     * (d) the amount is sourced, directly or indirectly, from the profits of the ADI before the restructure instrument came into force; and

     * (e) the amount would have been a *frankable distribution if it had been distributed by the ADI before the restructure instrument came into force.

    * (2) The amount:

     * (a) is taken to be a **_dividend_** paid by the body, for the purposes of this Act (and so is a *distribution by the body); and

     * (b) is not taken to be an *unfrankable distribution by the body just because of paragraph 20245(e) (which makes distributions from *share capital accounts unfrankable).

##### Subdivision 202D--Amount of the franking credit on a distribution

##### Guide to Subdivision 202D

##### 20250  What this Subdivision is about

    * The amount of the franking credit on a distribution is that stated in the distribution statement, unless the amount stated exceeds the maximum franking credit for the distribution.

    * In that case, the amount of the franking credit on the distribution is taken to be the maximum franking credit for the distribution, worked out under this Subdivision.

##### Table of sections

      * 20255	What is the maximum franking credit for a frankable distribution?

  * Operative provisions

      * 20260	Amount of the franking credit on a distribution

      * 20265	Where the franking credit stated in the distribution statement exceeds the maximum franking credit for the distribution

##### 20255  What is the maximum franking credit for a frankable distribution?

    * The maximum franking credit for a distribution is equivalent to the maximum amount of income tax that the entity making the distribution could have paid, at the current standard corporate tax rate, on the profits underlying the distribution.

##### Operative provisions

##### 20260  Amount of the franking credit on a distribution

    * (1) The amount of the *franking credit on a *distribution is that stated in the *distribution statement for the distribution, unless that amount exceeds the *maximum franking credit for the distribution.

    * (2) The **_maximum franking credit _**for a *distribution is worked out using the formula:

##### 20265  Where the franking credit stated in the distribution statement exceeds the maximum franking credit for the distribution

    * If the amount of a *franking credit stated in a *distribution statement for a *distribution exceeds the *maximum franking credit for the distribution, the amount of the franking credit on the distribution is taken to be the amount of the maximum franking credit for the distribution, and not the amount stated in the distribution statement.

##### Subdivision 202E--Distribution statements

##### Guide to Subdivision 202E

##### 20270  What this Subdivision is about

    * An entity that makes a frankable distribution must give the recipient a statement setting out details of the distribution.

##### Table of sections

  * Operative provisions

      * 20275	Obligation to give a distribution statement

      * 20280	Distribution statement

      * 20285	Changing the franking credit on a distribution by amending the distribution statement

##### Operative provisions

##### 20275  Obligation to give a distribution statement

    * (1) An entity that makes a *frankable distribution must give the recipient a *distribution statement.

    * (2) The statement must be given on or before the day on which the *distribution is made, unless the entity is allowed to give the statement at a later time under subsection (3).

    * (3) If the entity is a *private company for the income year in which the *distribution is made, the statement must be given:

     * (a) before the end of 4 months after the end of the income year in which the distribution is made; or

     * (b) before the time determined by the Commissioner under subsection (5);

    * whichever is later.

    * (4) However, the entity is not allowed to give the statement at a later time under subsection (3) if the statement indicates that a *franking credit has been allocated to the *distribution and the franking credit would, either alone or when added to other franking credits allocated to other distributions made by the entity during the income year, result in the entity having a liability for *franking deficit tax, or an increased liability for franking deficit tax, at the end of the income year.

         * Note: The combined effect of subsections (3) and (4) is that a private company can retrospectively frank a distribution, but not so as to create or increase a liability for franking deficit tax.

    * (5) The Commissioner may determine in writing that a *private company may give the statement before a time specified in the determination.

##### 20280  Distribution statement

    * (1) A **_distribution statement_** is a statement made in accordance with this section.

    * (2) The statement must be in the *approved form.

    * (3) The statement must:

     * (a) identify the entity making the distribution; and

     * (b) state the date on which the distribution is made; and

     * (c) state the amount of the distribution; and

     * (d) state that there is a *franking credit of an amount specified on the distribution; and

     * (e) state the *franking percentage for the distribution; and

     * (f) state the amount of any *withholding tax that has been deducted from the distribution by the entity; and

     * (g) include any other information required by the *approved form that is relevant to imputation generally or the distribution.

         * Note: Under the _Taxation Administration Act 1953 _it is an offence to fail to give a statement required under this Subdivision, or make a misleading statement in connection with a distribution (whether franked or not).

##### 20285  Changing the franking credit on a distribution by amending the distribution statement

    * Changing the franking credit on a specified distribution

    * (1) The Commissioner may, on application by an entity, determine in writing that the entity may change the *franking credit on a specified *distribution by amending the *distribution statement for the distribution.

    * (2) In deciding whether to make a determination under subsection (1), the Commissioner must have regard to:

     * (a) whether the date for lodgment of an *income tax return by the recipient of the specified *distribution for the income year in which the distribution was made has passed; and

     * (b) whether, if the *franking credit on the specified distribution were changed in accordance with the entity's application, there would be any difference in the *withholding tax liability of the recipient; and

     * (c) whether amending the distribution statement as requested by the entity would lead to a breach of the *benchmark rule, or any of the rules in Division 204 (the antistreaming rules); and

     * (d) whether amending the distribution statement as requested by the entity would lead to a new *benchmark franking percentage being set for the entity for the *franking period in which the distribution was made; and

     * (e) any other matters that the Commissioner considers relevant.

    * Changing the franking credits on a specified class of distributions

    * (3) The Commissioner may, on application by an entity, determine in writing that the entity may change the *franking credits on *distributions of a specified class by amending the *distribution statements for the distributions.

    * (4) In deciding whether to make a determination under subsection (3), the Commissioner must have regard to:

     * (a) the number of recipients to whom an amended *distribution statement would be made; and

     * (b) whether the date for lodgment of *income tax returns by recipients of *distributions of the specified class for the income year in which the distributions were made has passed; and

     * (c) whether, if the *franking credit on the specified distributions were changed in accordance with the entity's application, there would be any difference in the *withholding tax liability of the recipients; and

     * (d) whether amending the distribution statements as requested by the entity would lead to a breach of the *benchmark rule, or any of the rules in Division 204 (the antistreaming rules); and

     * (e) whether amending the distribution statements as requested by the entity would lead to a new *benchmark franking percentage being set for the entity for the *franking period in which the distributions were made; and

     * (f) any other matters that the Commissioner considers relevant.

    * Applying to the Commissioner

    * (5) The entity must:

     * (a) make its application under this section in writing; and

     * (b) include in the application all information relevant to the matters to which the Commissioner must have regard under:

       * (i) subsection (2), if the application relates to a *distribution; or

       * (ii) subsection (4), if the application relates to a class of distributions.

    * Review

    * (6) If the entity or a *member of the entity is dissatisfied with a determination under subsection (3), the entity or member may object to it in the manner set out in Part IVC of the _Taxation Administration Act 1953_.

#### Division 203--Benchmark rule

      * 20355	Commissioner's powers to permit a departure from the benchmark rule

##### 2035  Benchmark rule

    * (1) A corporate tax entity must frank all frankable distributions made within a particular period at a franking percentage set as the benchmark for that period. This is the benchmark rule.

    * (2) The benchmark rule does not apply to some corporate tax entities. Those entities are identified in section 20320.

##### 20310  Benchmark franking percentage

    * (1) The benchmark franking percentage for an entity is set by reference to the franking percentage for the first frankable distribution made by the entity during the relevant period.

    * (2) An entity has a benchmark franking percentage, even if it is not subject to the benchmark rule.

##### Operative provisions

##### 20315  Object

    * The object of this Subdivision is to ensure that one *member of a *corporate tax entity is not preferred over another when the entity *franks *distributions.

##### 20320  Application of the benchmark rule

    * (1) The *benchmark rule does not apply to a company in a *franking period if either:

     * (a) the company satisfies each of the following criteria:

       * (i) at all times during the franking period, the company is a *listed public company;

       * (ii) the company cannot make a *distribution on one *membership interest during the franking period without making a distribution under the same resolution on all other membership interests;

       * (iii) the company cannot *frank a distribution made on one membership interest during the franking period without franking distributions made on all other membership interests under the same resolution with a *franking credit worked out using the same *franking percentage; or

     * (b) the entity is a *100% subsidiary of a company that satisfies the criteria set out in paragraph (a).

    * (2) The following are examples of cases in which a company satisfies the criteria set out in paragraph (1)(a):

     * (a) the company is a *listed public company with a single *class of *membership interest at all times during the relevant *franking period;

     * (b) the company is a listed public company that, under its constituent documents, must not:

       * (i) make a *distribution on one membership interest during the relevant franking period without making a distribution under the same resolution on all other membership interests; or

       * (ii) *frank a distribution made on one membership interest during the relevant franking period without franking distributions made on all other membership interests under the same resolution with a *franking credit worked out using the same *franking percentage;

     * (c) the company is a listed public company with more than one class of membership interest, but the rights in relation to distributions and the franking of distributions are the same for each class of membership interest.

    * This is not an exhaustive list.

    * (3) For the purposes of subsection (1), ignore *membership interests that do not carry a right to receive *distributions (other than distributions on the winding up of the company).

##### 20325  Benchmark rule

    * An entity must not make a *frankable distribution whose *franking percentage differs from the entity's *benchmark franking percentage for the *franking period in which the distribution is made. This is the **_benchmark rule_**.

         * Note: If a corporate tax entity franks a distribution in breach of this rule, the distribution will still be a franked distribution, although consequences will flow under section 20350.

##### 20330  Setting a benchmark franking percentage

    * The **_benchmark franking percentage_** for an entity for a *franking period is the same as the *franking percentage for the first *frankable distribution made by the entity within the period.

         * Note: If no frankable distribution is made during the period, there is no benchmark franking percentage for the period.

##### 20335  Franking percentage

    * (1) Subject to subsection (2), the **_franking percentage_** for a *frankable distribution is worked out using the formula:

    * (2) If the *franking percentage for a *frankable distribution would exceed 100% if it were worked out under subsection (1), it is taken to be 100%.

##### 20340  Franking periods--where the entity is not a private company

    * (1) Use this section to work out the franking periods for an entity in an income year where the entity is not a *private company for the income year.

    * (2) If the entity's income year is a period of 12 months, each of the following is a **_franking period _**for the entity in that year:

     * (a) the period of 6 months beginning at the start of the entity's income year;

     * (b) the remainder of the income year.

    * (3) If the entity's income year is a period of 6 months or less, the **_franking period _**for the entity in that year is the same as the income year.

    * (4) If the entity's income year is a period of more than 6 months and less than 12 months, each of the following is a **_franking period _**for the entity in that year:

     * (a) the period of 6 months beginning at the start of the entity's income year;

     * (b) the remainder of the income year.

    * (5) If the entity's income year is a period of more than 12 months, each of the following is a **_franking period_** for the entity in that year:

     * (a) the period of 6 months beginning at the start of the entity's income year (the **_first franking period_**);

     * (b) the period of 6 months beginning immediately after the end of the first franking period;

     * (c) the remainder of the income year.

##### 20345  Franking period--private companies

    * The **_franking period_** for an entity that is a *private company for an income year is the same as the income year.

##### 20350  Consequences of breaching the benchmark rule

    * (1) If an entity makes a *frankable distribution in breach of the *benchmark rule:

     * (a) the entity is liable to pay overfranking tax imposed by the _New Business Tax System (Overfranking Tax) Act 2002_ if the *franking percentage for the *distribution exceeds the entity's *benchmark franking percentage for the *franking period in which the distribution is made; and

     * (b) a *franking debit arises in the entity's *franking account if the franking percentage for the distribution is less than the entity's benchmark franking percentage for the franking period in which the distribution is made.

    * (2) Use the following formula to work out:

     * (a) in a case dealt with under paragraph (1)(a)--the amount of the *overfranking tax; and

     * (b) in a case dealt with under paragraph (1)(b)--the amount of the *franking debit:

    * where: 

    * **_franking % differential _**is the difference between:

     * (a) the *franking percentage for the *frankable distribution; and

     * (b) either:

       * (i) if subparagraph (ii) does not apply--the entity's *benchmark franking percentage for the *franking period in which the *distribution is made; or

       * (ii) if the Commissioner in the exercise of the Commissioner's powers under subsection 20355(1), permits the entity to frank the distribution at a different franking percentage--that percentage.

         * Example: An entity makes 3 successive frankable distributions in a franking period. Each of those distributions is represented in the following diagram. The franking percentage for the first distribution is 40%, and so the entity's benchmark franking percentage for the period is 40%.

         * Note: Distribution 2 is underfranked to the extent of the franking % differential. This is used to work out the amount of the underfranking debit under subsection (2).

         * Distribution 3 is overfranked to the extent of the franking % differential. This is used to work out the amount of overfranking tax on the distribution under the _New Business Tax System (Overfranking Tax) Act 2002_. The amount of the tax is calculated using the same formula as that set out in subsection (2).

    * (3) A *franking debit arising under paragraph (1)(b) is in addition to any franking debit that would otherwise arise for the entity because of the *distribution.

    * (4) The *franking debit arises on the day on which the *frankable distribution is made.

##### 20355  Commissioner's powers to permit a departure from the benchmark rule

    * Powers of the Commissioner

    * (1) The Commissioner may, on application by an entity, make a determination in writing permitting the entity to *frank a *distribution at a *franking percentage that differs from the entity's *benchmark franking percentage for the *franking period in which the distribution is made.

    * (2) Because the *benchmark rule is an integral part of the imputation system, the Commissioner's powers under this section may only be exercised in extraordinary circumstances.

    * Matters to which the Commissioner must have regard in exercising the power

    * (3) In deciding whether there are extraordinary circumstances justifying the exercise of the Commissioner's power to make a determination under subsection (1), the Commissioner must have regard to:

     * (a) the entity's reasons for departing, or proposing to depart, from the *benchmark rule; and

     * (b) the extent of the departure, or proposed departure, from the benchmark rule; and

     * (c) if the circumstances that give rise to the entity's application are within the entity's control, the extent to which the entity has sought the exercise of the Commissioner's powers under this section in the past; and

     * (d) whether a *member of the entity has been or will be disadvantaged as a result of the departure, or proposed departure, from the benchmark rule; and

     * (e) whether a *member of the entity will receive greater *imputation benefits than another member of the entity because a distribution *franked at a *franking percentage that differs from the *benchmark franking percentage for the *franking period is made to one of them; and

     * (f) any other matters that the Commissioner considers relevant.

    * When may the powers be exercised?

    * (4) The Commissioner may make a determination under subsection (1) either before or after the *frankable distribution is made.

    * Consequence of the Commissioner exercising the power under this section

    * (5) An allocation of a *franking credit at a percentage specified by the Commissioner in a determination under subsection (1) is taken to comply with the *benchmark rule.

    * Applying to the Commissioner

    * (6) The entity must:

     * (a) make its application under this section in writing; and

     * (b) include in the application all information relevant to the matters to which the Commissioner must have regard under subsection (3).

    * Review

    * (7) If the entity or a *member of the entity is dissatisfied with the determination under subsection (1), the entity or member may object to it in the manner set out in Part IVC of the _Taxation Administration Act 1953_.

##### Subdivision 204B--Linked distributions

##### Guide to Subdivision 204B

##### 20410  What this Subdivision is about

    * This Subdivision prevents the exploitation of a corporate tax entity's benchmark franking percentage by another corporate tax entity, or that other entity's members, by imposing a franking debit where there is exploitation.

##### Operative provisions

##### 20415  Linked distributions

    * Franking debit arises where a distribution by one entity is substituted for a distribution by another

    * (1) This section gives rise to a *franking debit if:

     * (a) the exercise of a choice or selection by a *member of an entity (the **_first entity_**); or

     * (b) the member's failure to exercise a choice or selection;

    * has the effect of determining (to any extent) that another entity makes to one of its members a *distribution (the **_linked distribution_**) that is:

     * (c) in substitution (in whole or in part) for a distribution by the first entity to that member or any other member of the first entity; and

     * (d) unfranked, or *franked at a *franking percentage that differs from the first entity's *benchmark franking percentage for the *franking period in which the linked distribution is made.

         * Note: Division 205 deals with a corporate tax entity's franking account and sets out when a debit, known as a franking debit, arises in that account.

    * Franking account in which the debit arises

    * (2) The debit arises in the *franking account of the entity with the higher *benchmark franking percentage for the *franking period in which the linked distribution is made.

    * Amount of the debit

    * (3) The debit is equal to the one that would arise in that *franking account if the entity had made a *franked distribution, equal to the linked distribution, with a *franking percentage equal to the *benchmark franking percentage for that entity.

    * When does the debit arise

    * (4) The debit arises on the day on which the linked distribution is made.

    * Debit is in addition to any other franking debit arising because of the linked distribution

    * (5) The debit is in addition to any other debit that arises in an entity's *franking account because of the linked distribution.

    * Where an entity has no benchmark franking percentage

    * (6) If an entity has no *benchmark franking percentage for the *franking period in which the linked distribution is made, this section applies as if:

     * (a) in a case where the linked distribution has a *franking percentage of less than 50%--the entity had a benchmark franking percentage of 100% for that period; and

     * (b) in a case where the linked distribution has a franking percentage equal to or greater than 50%--the entity had a benchmark franking percentage of 0% for that period.

##### Subdivision 204C--Substituting taxexempt bonus share for franked distributions

##### Guide to Subdivision 204C

##### 20420  What this Subdivision is about

    * This Subdivision prevents the substitution of a taxexempt bonus share for a franked distribution by imposing a franking debit on the issue of the share as if it were a franked distribution.

##### 20425  Substituting taxexempt bonus shares for franked distributions

    * Franking debit arises if taxexempt bonus shares are issued in substitution for a franked distribution

    * (1) This section gives rise to a *franking debit in an entity's *franking account if:

     * (a) the exercise of a choice or selection by a *member of the entity; or

     * (b) the member's failure to exercise a choice or selection;

    * has the effect of determining (to any extent) that the entity issues one or more *taxexempt bonus shares, to that member or another member of the entity, in substitution (in whole or in part) for one or more *franked distributions by the entity to that member or another member.

    * Amount of the debit

    * (2) The debit is equal to the one that would arise in the entity's *franking account if the entity made a *distribution, equal to the *franked distributions referred to in subsection (1), franked at the entity's *benchmark franking percentage for the *franking period in which the shares are issued.

    * When does the debit arise

    * (3) The debit arises on the day when the shares are issued.

    * Meaning of **taxexempt bonus share**

    * **	(4)	For a company whose *shares have no par value, **_taxexempt bonus share_** means a share issued by the company in the circumstances mentioned in subsection 6BA(6) of the _Income Tax Assessment Act 1936_.

    * (5) For any other company, **_taxexempt bonus share_** means a *share issued by the company to a *shareholder in the company where:

     * (a) the amount or value of the share is debited against an amount standing to the credit of a share premium account of the company; and

     * (b) no part of the paidup value of the share is a dividend; and

     * (c) the share is issued:

       * (i) as a bonus share; or

       * (ii) in the circumstances mentioned in subsection 6BA(1) of the _Income Tax Assessment Act 1936_, as in force immediately before 1 July 1998.

    * Where a company has no benchmark franking percentage for the franking period

    * (6) If a company has no *benchmark franking percentage for the *franking period in which the *taxexempt bonus share is issued, this section applies as if the entity had a benchmark franking percentage of 100% for that period.

##### Operative provisions

##### 20430  Streaming distributions

    * Commissioner's power to make a determination when distributions or distributions and other benefits are streamed

    * (1) This section empowers the Commissioner to make determinations if an entity streams one or more *distributions (or one or more distributions and the giving of other benefits), whether in a single *franking period or in a number of franking periods, in such a way that:

     * (a) an *imputation benefit is, or apart from this section would be, received by a *member of the entity as a result of the distribution or distributions; and

     * (b) the member would *derive a *greater benefit from franking credits than another member of the entity; and

     * (c) the other member of the entity will receive lesser imputation benefits, or will not receive any imputation benefits, whether or not the other member receives other benefits.

    * The member that derives the greater benefit from franking credits is the **_favoured member_**. The member that receives the lesser imputation benefits is the **_disadvantaged member_**.

    * Examples of other benefits

    * (2) These are examples of the giving of other benefits:

     * (a) issuing bonus *shares;

     * (b) returning *paidup share capital;

     * (c) *forgiving a debt;

     * (d) the entity or another entity making a payment of any kind, or giving any property, to a *member or to another person on a member's behalf.

    * Nature of the determination that the Commissioner may make

    * (3) The Commissioner may make one or more of these determinations:

     * (a) that a specified *franking debit arises in the *franking account of the entity, for a specified *distribution or other benefit to a disadvantaged member;

     * (b) that a specified *exempting debit arises in the *exempting account of the entity, for a specified *distribution or other benefit to a disadvantaged member;

     * (c) that no *imputation benefit is to arise in respect of a distribution that is made to a favoured member and specified in the determination.

    * A determination must be in writing.

    * (4) The Commissioner may:

     * (a) specify the *franking debit under paragraph (3)(a) by specifying the *franking percentage to be used in working out the amount of the debit; and

     * (b) specify the *exempting debit under paragraph (3)(b) by specifying the *exempting percentage to be used in working out the amount of the debit.

    * (5) The Commissioner may specify the *distribution under paragraph (3)(a), (b) or (c) by specifying:

     * (a) the date on which the distribution was made, or the period during which the distribution was made; and

     * (b) the member, or class of members, to whom the distribution was made.

    * What is an imputation benefit?

    * (6) A *member of an entity receives an **_imputation benefit_** as a result of a distribution if:

     * (a) the member is entitled to a *tax offset under Division 207 as a result of the distribution; or

     * (b) an amount would be included in the member's assessable income as a result of the distribution because of the operation of section 20735; or

     * (c) a *franking credit would arise in the *franking account of the member as a result of the distribution; or

     * (d) an *exempting credit would arise in the *exempting account of the member as a result of the distribution; or

     * (e) the member would not be liable to pay *withholding tax on the distribution, because of the operation of paragraph 128B(3)(ga) of the _Income Tax Assessment Act 1936_; or

     * (f) the member is entitled to a *tax offset under section 210170 as a result of the distribution.

    * When does a favoured member derive greater benefit from franking credits?

    * (7) The following subsection lists some of the cases in which a *member of an entity *derives a**_ greater benefit from franking credits _**than another member of the entity. It is not an exhaustive list.

    * (8) A *member of an entity *derives a **_greater benefit from franking credits _**than another member of the entity if any of the following circumstances exist in relation to the other member in the income year in which the distribution giving rise to the benefit is made, and not in relation to the first member:

     * (a) the other member is a foreign resident;

     * (b) the other member would not be entitled to any *tax offset under Division 207 because of the distribution;

     * (c) the amount of income tax that, apart from this Division, would be payable by the other member because of the distribution is less than the tax offset to which the other member would be entitled;

     * (d) the other member is a *corporate tax entity at the time the distribution is made, but no *franking credit arises for the entity as a result of the distribution;

     * (e) the other member is a *corporate tax entity at the time the distribution is made, but cannot use *franking credits received on the distribution to *frank distributions to its own members because:

       * (i) it is not a *franking entity; or

       * (ii) it is unable to make *frankable distributions;

     * (f) the other member is an *exempting entity.

    * (9) A *member of an entity *derives a **_greater benefit from franking credits _**than another member of the entity if any of the following circumstances exist in relation to the first member in the income year in which the *distribution giving rise to the benefit is made, and not in relation to the other member:

     * (a) a *franking credit arises for the first member under item 5, 6 or 7 of the table in section 208130 (distributions by *exempting entities to exempting entities);

     * (b) a franking credit or *exempting credit arises for the first member because the distribution is *franked with an exempting credit;

     * (c) the first member is entitled to a *tax offset because:

       * (i) the distribution is a *franked distribution made by an exempting entity; or

       * (ii) the distribution is *franked with an exempting credit.

    * (10) A *member of an entity *derives a **_greater benefit from franking credits _**than another member if the first member is entitled to a *tax offset under section 210170 as a result of the *distribution, and the other member is not.

##### 20435  When does a franking debit arise if the Commissioner makes a determination under paragraph 20430(3)(a)

    * (1) If the Commissioner makes a determination giving rise to a *franking debit in the *franking account of an entity under paragraph 20430(3)(a), the debit arises in the franking account of the entity on the day on which the notice of determination is given to the entity in accordance with section 20450.

    * (2) If the Commissioner makes a determination giving rise to an *exempting debit in the *exempting account of an entity under paragraph 20430(3)(b), the debit arises in the exempting account of the entity on the day on which the notice of determination is given to the entity in accordance with section 20450.

##### 20440  Amount of the franking debit

    * (1) The amount of the *franking debit arising because of a determination by the Commissioner under paragraph 20430(3)(a) must not exceed:

     * (a) if the specified *distribution has been *franked--the difference between the amount of the *franking credit on the distribution and an amount worked out by multiplying the amount of the distribution by the highest *franking percentage at which a distribution to a favoured member is franked; or

     * (b) if the specified distribution, although *frankable, has not been franked--an amount worked out by multiplying the amount of the distribution by the highest franking percentage at which a distribution to a favoured member is franked; or

     * (c) if the specified distribution is *unfrankable--an amount worked out by multiplying the amount of the distribution by the highest franking percentage at which a distribution to a favoured member is franked; or

     * (d) if the specified benefit is the issue of bonus shares from a share premium account--an amount worked out by multiplying the amount debited to the share premium account in respect of the bonus shares by the highest franking percentage at which a distribution to a favoured member is franked; or

     * (e) if some other benefit is specified--an amount worked out by multiplying the value of the benefit by the highest franking percentage at which a distribution to a favoured member is franked.

    * (2) In specifying the *franking debit, the Commissioner must have regard to:

     * (a) any *franking debit already arising in the *franking account of the entity under paragraph 20350(1)(b) because the entity franked the specified *distribution in breach of the *benchmark rule; and

     * (b) any franking debit already arising in the franking account of the entity, because of the specified distribution or benefit, under section 20415 (about linked distributions) or section 20425 (about substituting *taxexempt bonus shares for *franked distributions).

##### 20441  Amount of the exempting debit

    * The amount of the *exempting debit arising because of a determination by the Commissioner under paragraph 20430(3)(b) must not exceed:

     * (a) if the specified *distribution has been *franked with an exempting credit--the difference between the amount of the *exempting credit on the distribution and an amount worked out by multiplying the amount of the distribution by the highest *exempting percentage at which a distribution to a favoured member is franked; or

     * (b) if the specified distribution, although *frankable, has not been franked with an exempting credit--an amount worked out by multiplying the amount of the distribution by the highest exempting percentage at which a distribution to a favoured member is franked; or

     * (c) if the specified distribution is *unfrankable--an amount worked out by multiplying the amount of the distribution by the highest exempting percentage at which a distribution to a favoured member is franked; or

     * (d) if the specified benefit is the issue of bonus shares from a share premium account--an amount worked out by multiplying the amount debited to the share premium account in respect of the bonus shares by the highest exempting percentage at which a distribution to a favoured member is franked; or

     * (e) if some other benefit is specified--an amount worked out by multiplying the value of the benefit by the highest exempting percentage at which a distribution to a favoured member is franked.

##### 20445  Effect of a determination about distributions to favoured members

    * If the Commissioner makes a determination denying an *imputation benefit under paragraph 20430(3)(c) (about distributions to favoured members), the determination has effect according to its terms.

##### 20450  Assessment and notice of determination

    * (1) A determination under subsection 20430(3) does not form part of an assessment.

    * (2) The Commissioner must give notice in writing of the determination:

     * (a) in a case where the Commissioner determines that a *franking debit is to arise in the *franking account of an entity under paragraph 20430(3)(a)--to the entity; and

     * (b) in a case where the Commissioner determines that an *exempting debit is to arise in the *exempting account of an entity under paragraph 20430(3)(b)--to the entity; and

     * (c) in a case where a favoured member is denied an *imputation benefit under paragraph 20430(3)(c)--to the favoured member.

    * (3) If the Commissioner makes a determination denying an *imputation benefit under paragraph 20430(3)(c) on a *distribution made by a *listed public company, the Commissioner is taken to have served notice in writing of the determination on the favoured member if the Commissioner causes a notice to be published in a daily newspaper that circulates generally in each State, the Australian Capital Territory and the Northern Territory. The notice is taken to have been served on the day on which the publication takes place.

    * (4) A notice under this section may be included in a notice of assessment.

##### 20455  Right to review where a determination made

    * If a taxpayer to whom a determination relates is dissatisfied with the determination, the taxpayer may object to it in the manner set out in Part IVC of the _Taxation Administration Act 1953_.

##### Subdivision 204E--Disclosure requirements

##### Guide to Subdivision 204E

##### 20465  What this Subdivision is about

    * This Subdivision requires an entity to notify the Commissioner where there is a significant difference in its benchmark franking percentage over time, so that the Commissioner can assess whether there is streaming.

##### Table of sections

      * 20470	Application of this Subdivision

      * 20475	Notice to the Commissioner

      * 20480	Commissioner may require information where the Commissioner suspects streaming

##### Operative provisions

##### 20470  Application of this Subdivision

    * (1) This Subdivision applies to an entity if the difference between:

     * (a) the *benchmark franking percentage for the entity for a *franking period (the **_current franking period_**); and

     * (b) the benchmark franking percentage for the entity for the last franking period in which a *frankable distribution was made (the **_last relevant franking period_**);

    * is more than the amount worked out using the following formula (whether the percentage for the current franking period is more than or less than the percentage for the last relevant franking period):

    * (2) However, this Subdivision does not apply to an entity to which the benchmark rule does not apply.

         * Note: Section 20320 identifies the entities to which the benchmark rule does not apply.

##### 20475  Notice to the Commissioner

    * (1) The entity must notify the Commissioner in writing of the difference.

    * (3) The notice must also state:

     * (a) the *benchmark franking percentage for the current franking period; and

     * (b) the benchmark franking percentage for the last relevant franking period.

    * (4) The notice must be in the *approved form and must be given to the Commissioner:

     * (a) if the entity is required to give the Commissioner a *franking return for the income year in which the current franking period occurs--with that return; or

     * (b) otherwise--within one month after the end of the income year in which the current franking period occurs.

         * Note: See Subdivision 214A for requirements to give the Commissioner franking returns.

##### 20480  Commissioner may require information where the Commissioner suspects streaming

    * (1) The Commissioner may request the entity to give the Commissioner the following information:

     * (a) the entity's reasons for setting a benchmark franking percentage for the current franking period that differs significantly from the benchmark franking percentage for the last relevant franking period; and

     * (b) the *franking percentages for all *frankable distributions made in the current franking period and the last relevant franking period; and

     * (c) details of any other benefits given to the entity's *members, either by the entity or an *associate of the entity, during the period beginning at the beginning of the last relevant franking period and ending at the end of the current franking period; and

     * (d) whether any member of the entity has *derived, or will derive, a *greater benefit from franking credits than another member of the entity as a result of the variation in the benchmark franking percentage between the current franking period and the last relevant franking period; and

     * (e) any other information required by the *approved form that is relevant in determining whether the entity is streaming *distributions.

    * (2) The entity must comply with the Commissioner's request.

#### Division 205--Franking accounts, franking deficit tax liabilities and the related tax offset

##### Guide to Division 205

##### 2051  What this Division is about

    * This Division: 

     *  	creates a franking account for each entity that is, or has been, a corporate tax entity; and

     *  	identifies when franking credits and debits arise in those accounts and the amount of those credits and debits; and

     *  	identifies when there is a franking surplus or deficit in the account; and

     *  	creates a liability to pay franking deficit tax if the account is in deficit at certain times; and

     *  	creates a tax offset for that liability.

##### 2055  Franking accounts, franking deficit tax liabilities and the related tax offset

    * (1) Each entity that is, or has ever been, a corporate tax entity has a franking account.

    * (2) The payment of a PAYG instalment or income tax will generate a franking credit in that account. The amount of the credit is equal to the amount of tax paid. The receipt of a franked distribution by an entity from another corporate tax entity will also generate a franking credit. There are other circumstances in which a franking credit arises.

    * (3) The receipt of a refund of income tax or the payment of a franked distribution by a corporate tax entity will generate a franking debit. There are, however, other cases where a franking debit arises. For example, a franking debit might arise under a determination by the Commissioner because distributions have been streamed.

    * (4) An entity must be a franking entity at certain times and satisfy certain residency requirements before a franking credit or debit arises in its account.

    * (5) Franking deficit tax is payable if the franking account of an entity is in deficit at the end of the entity's income year, or when the entity ceases to be a franking entity.

    * (6) A tax offset is available to an entity that has incurred a liability to pay franking deficit tax.

##### Operative provisions

##### 20510  Each entity that is or has been a corporate tax entity has a franking account

    * There is a **_franking account_** for each entity that is, or has at any time been, a *corporate tax entity.

         * Note: The balance in the franking account on 1 July 2002 will either be nil or, if the entity had a franking surplus or deficit immediately before 1 July 2002 under the imputation scheme existing at that time, an amount calculated under the _Income Tax (Transitional Provisions) Act 1997_.

##### 20515  Franking credits

    * (1) The following table sets out when a credit arises in the *franking account of an entity and the amount of the credit. The credit is called a **_franking credit_**.

    * (2) A *franking credit covered by item 4 of the table arises at the end of the income year:

     * (a) that is an income year of the last partnership or trust interposed between:

       * (i) the entity; and

       * (ii) the *corporate tax entity that made the distribution; and

     * (b) during which the *franked distribution *flows indirectly to the entity.

    * (3) Despite item 1 or 2 of the table in subsection (1), no credit arises on that part of the payment that is attributable to a payment of income tax in relation to either or both of the following:

     * (a) an *FHSA component;

     * (b) an *RSA component.

    * (4) An entity's *franking credit for a payment mentioned in item 1 or 2 of the table in subsection (1) is reduced by the amount (if any) worked out as follows, but not below zero.

Method statement

       * Step 1.	Identify any income years ending before the payment was made for which the entity has *received a refund of income tax.

       * Step 2.	Add up the part (if any) of each of those refunds that is attributable to a *tax offset that is subject to the refundable tax offset rules because of section 6730 (about R&D).

       * Step 3.	Subtract any reduction under this subsection of a *franking credit for any earlier payment by the entity. (For this purpose, assume a credit reduced to zero is still a franking credit.)

##### 20520  Paying a PAYG instalment or income tax

    * (1) An entity **_pays a PAYG instalment_** if and only if:

     * (a) the entity has a liability to pay the instalment; and

     * (b) either:

       * (i) the entity makes a payment to satisfy the liability (in whole or in part); or

       * (ii) a credit, or an *RBA surplus, is applied to discharge or reduce the liability.

         * Note: The requirement in paragraph (a) means that the entity cannot generate franking credits by making a "voluntary" payment of income tax (that is, paying an amount on account of income tax for which the entity is not liable at the time when the payment is made).

    * (2) If an entity:

     * (a) is liable to pay a *PAYG instalment; and

     * (b) has a *PAYG instalment variation credit;

    * the PAYG instalment variation credit must be fully applied to reduce the liability for the PAYG instalment before any other credit or payment can be applied to reduce that liability.

    * (3) An entity **_pays income tax _**if and only if:

     * (a) the entity has a liability to pay the income tax; and

     * (b) either:

       * (i) the entity makes a payment to satisfy the liability (in whole or in part); or

       * (ii) a credit, or an *RBA surplus, is applied to discharge or reduce the liability.

         * Note: The requirement in paragraph (a) means that the entity cannot generate franking credits by making a "voluntary" payment of income tax (that is, paying an amount on account of income tax for which the entity is not liable at the time when the payment is made).

    * (4) Subparagraphs (1)(b)(ii) and (3)(b)(ii) do not apply to the application of a credit allowable under or by virtue of section 4530 or 45215 in Schedule 1 to the _Taxation Administration Act 1953_ (these sections deal with credits for *PAYG instalments payable and credit on using a varied rate in certain cases).

    * (5) The amount of the *PAYG instalment or income tax paid is equal to:

     * (a) the amount of the liability, if it is satisfied in full; or

     * (b) the amount by which the liability is reduced, if it is not satisfied in full.

    * (6) If:

     * (a) a surplus in an *RBA of an entity is applied to satisfy a liability of the entity to *pay a PAYG instalment in respect of an income year; and

     * (b) a credit allowable under section 4530 in Schedule 1 to the _Taxation Administration Act 1953_ in respect of that income year is included in the RBA; and

     * (c) the RBA does not include the liability to pay the *PAYG instalment; and

     * (d) the amount of the credit exceeds the income tax assessed to the entity in respect of that income year;

    * the amount of the PAYG instalment paid by virtue of the application of the surplus is reduced by the amount of the excess mentioned in paragraph (d).

##### 20525  Residency requirement for an event giving rise to a franking credit or franking debit

    * (1) An entity satisfies the **_residency requirement _**for an income year in which, or in relation to which, an event specified in a relevant table occurs if:

     * (a) the entity is a company, or a *corporate limited partnership, to which at least one of the following subparagraphs applies:

       * (i) the entity is an Australian resident for more than one half of the 12 months immediately preceding the event if the event occurs before the end of the income year;

       * (ii) the entity is an Australian resident at all times during the income year when the entity exists if the event occurs at or after the end of the income year;

       * (iii) the entity is an Australian resident for more than one half of the income year (whether or not the event occurs before the end of the income year); or

     * (b) the entity is a *corporate unit trust for the income year; or

     * (c) the entity is a *public trading trust for the income year.

    * (2) The tables in sections 20515 and 20530 are relevant for the purposes of subsection (1).

##### 20530  Franking debits

    * (1) The following table sets out when a debit arises in the *franking account of an entity and the amount of the debit. The debit is called a **_franking debit_**.

         * Note: For completeness, the table refers to some franking debits that arise under other sections of the Act. This does not mean that separate franking debits arise both under the relevant section and this table.

    * (2) Despite item 2 of the table in subsection (1), no debit arises on that part of the refund that is attributable to any of the following:

     * (a) a payment of income tax in relation to either or both of the following:

       * (i) an *FHSA component;

       * (ii) an *RSA component;

     * (b) a *tax offset that is subject to the refundable tax offset rules because of section 6730 (about R&D).

##### 20535  Refund of income tax

    * (1) An entity **_receives a refund of income tax_** if and only if:

     * (a) either:

       * (i) the entity receives an amount as a refund; or

       * (ii) the Commissioner applies a credit, or an *RBA surplus, against a liability or liabilities of the entity; and

     * (b) the refund of the amount, or the application of the credit, represents in whole or in part:

       * (i) a return to the entity of an amount paid or applied to satisfy the entity's liability to pay income tax; or

       * (ii) the amount remaining after applying a *tax offset that is subject to the refundable tax offset rules because of section 6730 (about R&D) against the entity's basic income tax liability.

    * (2) The amount of the refund is so much of the amount refunded or applied as represents the return, or amount remaining, referred to in paragraph (1)(b).

##### 20540  Franking surplus and deficit

    * (1) An entity's *franking account is in **_surplus _**at a particular time if, at that time, the sum of the *franking credits in the account exceeds the sum of the *franking debits in the account. The amount of the **_franking surplus _**is the amount of the excess.

    * (2) An entity's *franking account is in **_deficit _**at a particular time if, at that time, the sum of the *franking debits in the account exceeds the sum of the *franking credits in the account. The amount of the **_franking deficit _**is the amount of the excess.

##### 20545  Franking deficit tax

    * Object

    * (1) While recognising that an entity may anticipate *franking credits when *franking *distributions, the object of this section is to prevent those credits from being anticipated indefinitely by requiring the entity to reconcile its *franking account at certain times and levying tax if the account is in *deficit.

    * Franking deficit at end of income year

    * (2) An entity is liable to pay franking deficit tax imposed by the _New Business Tax System (Franking Deficit Tax) Act 2002 _if its *franking account is in *deficit at the end of an income year.

    * Corporate tax entity ceases to be a franking entity

    * (3) An entity is liable to pay *franking deficit tax imposed by the _New Business Tax System (Franking Deficit Tax) Act 2002 _if:

     * (a) it ceases to be a *franking entity; and

     * (b) immediately before it ceases to be a franking entity, its *franking account is in *deficit.

         * Note: The tax is imposed in the _New Business Tax System (Franking Deficit Tax) Act 2002 _and the amount of the tax is set out in that Act.

##### 20550  Deferring franking deficit

    * Object

    * (1) The object of this section is to ensure that an entity does not avoid *franking deficit tax by deferring the time at which a *franking debit occurs in its *franking account.

    * End of year deficit deferred

    * (2) An entity is taken to have *received a refund of income tax for an income year immediately before the end of that year for the purposes of subsection 20545(2) if:

     * (a) the refund is paid within 3 months after the end of that year; and

     * (b) the *franking account of the entity would have been in *deficit, or in deficit to a greater extent, at the end of that year if the refund had been received in that year.

    * Deficit on ceasing to be a franking entity deferred

    * (3) If an entity ceases to be a *franking entity during an income year, the entity is taken to have *received a refund of income tax immediately before it ceased to be a franking entity for the purposes of subsection 20545(3) if:

     * (a) the refund is attributable to a period in the year during which the entity was a franking entity; and

     * (b) the refund is paid within 3 months after the entity ceases to be a franking entity; and

     * (c) the *franking account of the entity would have been in *deficit, or in deficit to a greater extent, immediately before it ceased to be a franking entity if the refund had been received before it ceased to be a franking entity.

##### 20570  Tax offset arising from franking deficit tax liabilities

    * When does the tax offset arise?

    * (1) A *corporate tax entity is entitled to a *tax offset for an income year for which it satisfies the *residency requirement (the **_relevant year_**) if at least one of the following applies:

     * (a) the entity has incurred a liability to pay *franking deficit tax in the relevant year;

     * (b) the entity incurred such a liability in a previous income year for which it did not satisfy the residency requirement, and that liability has not been taken into account in working out a tax offset under this section;

     * (c) when the entity was last entitled to a tax offset under this section for a previous income year, some of the offset remained after applying section 6310 (tax offset priority rules).

    * The amount of the tax offset

    * (2) Work out the amount of the *tax offset for the relevant year as follows:

Method statement

       * Step 1.	Work out the total amount of *franking deficit tax that is covered by paragraph (1)(a).

       * Then, subject to subsections (5) and (6), reduce so much of it as is attributable to *franking debits to which subsection (8) applies by 30% if that part exceeds 10% of the total amount of *franking credits that arose in the entity's *franking account for the relevant year.

       * Step 2.	Work out the total amount of *franking deficit tax that is covered by paragraph (1)(b) for a previous income year.

       * Then, subject to subsections (5) and (6), reduce so much of it as is attributable to *franking debits to which subsection (8) applies by 30% if that part exceeds 10% of the total amount of *franking credits that arose in the entity's *franking account for that previous income year.

       * Step 3.	Add up the results of step 2 for all the previous income years covered by paragraph (1)(b).

       * Step 4.	Work out the remaining amount of a *tax offset covered by paragraph (1)(c).

       * Step 5.	Add up the results of step, 3 and 4. The result is the *tax offset to which the entity is entitled under this section for the relevant year.

         * Note: This method statement is modified for certain late balancing entities: see section 20570 of the _Income Tax (Transitional Provisions) Act 1997_.

         * Example: The following apply to a corporate tax entity that satisfies the residency requirement for an income year:

          *  	the entity's income tax liability for that year would be $100,000 if its tax offsets were disregarded;

          *  	for that year, the entity has a tax offset of $60,000 under this section (the **_franking deficit offset_**) and a tax offset of $80,000 in respect of foreign income tax paid by the entity (the **_foreign income tax offset_**).

         * Under section 6310 (about tax offset priority rules), the foreign income tax offset must be applied before the franking deficit offset is applied. As a result, that offset and $20,000 of the franking deficit offset combine to reduce the entity's income tax liability to nil. The remaining $40,000 of the franking deficit offset will be included in a franking deficit offset for the next income year for which the entity satisfies the residency requirement.

    * Residency requirement

    * (4) To determine whether the entity satisfies the *residency requirement for the relevant year, section 20525 has effect as if each of the following were an event specified in a relevant table for the purposes of that section:

     * (a) the entity incurring a liability to pay *franking deficit tax in the relevant year;

     * (b) the assessment of the entity's income tax liability for the relevant year that is made on the *assessment day for that year.

    * 30% reduction will generally not apply to private company's first year of tax liability

    * (5) The 30% reductions in steps 1 and 2 of the method statement in subsection (2) do not apply in working out the amount of the *tax offset to which the entity is entitled for the relevant year if:

     * (a) the entity is a *private company for the relevant year; and

     * (b) if the company did not have the tax offset (but had all its other tax offsets) it would have had an income tax liability for the relevant year; and

     * (c) the company has not had an income tax liability for any income year before the relevant year; and

     * (d) the amount of the liability referred to in paragraph (b) is at least 90% of the amount of the *deficit in the company's *franking account at the end of the relevant year.

    * Commissioner's discretion

    * (6) The 30% reductions in steps 1 and 2 of the method statement in subsection (2) do not apply in working out the amount of the *tax offset to which the entity is entitled for the relevant year if the Commissioner determines in writing, on application by the entity in the *approved form, that the excess referred to in those steps was due to events outside the control of the entity.

    * (7) A determination under subsection (6) is not a legislative instrument.

    * Applicable franking debits

    * (8) This subsection applies to *franking debits in the *franking account of an entity:

     * (a) that arise under table item 1, 3, 5 or 6 in section 20530 for an income year; and

     * (b) if the entity has franking debits covered by paragraph (a) for that income year--that arise under table item 2 in that section for that income year.

##### Guide to Division 207

##### Table of sections

      * 2075	Overview

##### 2075  Overview

    * (1) If a corporate tax entity makes a franked distribution to one of its members, then, as a general rule:

     * (a) an amount equal to the franking credit on the distribution is included in the member's assessable income; and

     * (b) the member is entitled to a tax offset equal to the same amount.

    * (2) In some cases a residency requirement must be satisfied for the general rule to apply.

    * (3) If a franked distribution is made to a member that is a partnership or the trustee of a trust, an amount equal to the franking credit on the distribution is also included in the member's assessable income as mentioned in paragraph (1)(a).

    * (4) However, a tax offset in relation to that distribution is only available to an entity (who may be a partner, beneficiary or a trustee) if the distribution flows indirectly to it and does not flow indirectly through it to another entity. The tax offset is equal to its share of the franking credit on the distribution.

         * Note: That share is a notional amount and the entity can have that share without actually receiving any of that franking credit or distribution.

    * (5) There are exceptions to both the general rule mentioned in subsection (1) and the special rule mentioned in subsection (4). Basically, these exceptions are created:

     * (a) where the relevant entity would not have paid tax on the distribution or a share of the distribution (see Subdivisions 207D and 207E); and

     * (b) where there is a manipulation of the imputation system in a manner that is not permitted under the income tax law (see Subdivision 207F).

##### Subdivision 207A--Effect of receiving a franked distribution generally

##### 20710  What this Subdivision is about

    * As a general rule, if a member of an entity receives a franked distribution:

     *  	an amount equal to the franking credit on the distribution is included in the member's assessable income; and

     *  	the member is entitled to a tax offset equal to the franking credit on the distribution.

##### Operative provisions

##### 20715  Applying the general rule

    * (1) This Subdivision sets out, as a general rule, the tax effect of receiving a *franked distribution.

    * (2) This Subdivision does not apply to:

     * (a) a partnership or trustee to whom a *franked distribution is made (except a partnership or trustee that is a *corporate tax entity, or a trustee of a trust that is a *complying superannuation entity or *FHSA trust, when the distribution is made); or

     * (b) an entity to whom a franked distribution *flows indirectly.

         * Note: Subject to the other provisions in this Division, Subdivision 207B applies to an entity excluded from the application of this Subdivision because of this subsection.

    * (3) This Subdivision applies subject to Subdivisions 207C, 207D, 207E and 207F.

         * Note 1: Subdivision 207C sets out the residency requirements that must be satisfied by an individual or a corporate tax entity that receives a franked distribution.

         * Note 2: Subdivision 207D sets out the cases in which the grossup and tax offset rules in this Subdivision and Subdivision 207B will not apply because the franked distribution (or a share of it) would not have been taxed in any case.

         * Note 3: Subdivision 207E sets out the exceptions to the rules in Subdivision 207D.

         * Note 4: Subdivision 207F sets out the cases in which the grossup and tax offset rules in this Subdivision and Subdivision 207B will not apply because the imputation system has been manipulated in a way that is not permitted under the income tax law.

##### 20720  General rule--grossup and tax offset

    * (1) If an entity makes a *franked distribution to another entity, the assessable income of the receiving entity, for the income year in which the distribution is made, includes the amount of the *franking credit on the distribution. This is in addition to any other amount included in the receiving entity's assessable income in relation to the distribution under any other provision of this Act.

    * (2) The receiving entity is entitled to a *tax offset for the income year in which the distribution is made. The tax offset is equal to the *franking credit on the distribution.

##### Subdivision 207B--Franked distribution received through certain partnerships and trustees

##### Guide to Subdivision 207B

##### 20725  What this Subdivision is about

    * This Subdivision deals with an entity that receives a benefit of a franked distribution where: 

         * (a) the distribution is made to a partnership or the trustee of a trust; and

         * (b) the benefit is received either directly or through other interposed partnerships or trusts.

    * The distribution is regarded as flowing indirectly to the entity under this Subdivision.

    * On the basis of a notional amount of the entity's share of the distribution, the entity may be entitled to have an amount included in its assessable income and/or a tax offset under this Subdivision.

##### 20730  Applying this Subdivision

    * This Subdivision applies subject to Subdivisions 207D, 207E and 207F.

         * Note 1: Subdivision 207D sets out the cases in which the grossup and tax offset rules in this Subdivision and Subdivision 207A will not apply because the franked distribution (or a share of it) would not have been taxed in any case.

         * Note 2: Subdivision 207E sets out the exceptions to the rules in Subdivision 207D.

         * Note 3: Subdivision 207F sets out the cases in which the grossup and tax offset rules in this Subdivision and Subdivision 207A will not apply because the imputation system has been manipulated in a way that is not permitted under the income tax law.

##### 20735  Grossup--distribution made to, or flows indirectly through, a partnership or trustee

    * Additional amount of assessable income

    * (1) If:

     * (a) a *franked distribution is made in an income year to an entity that is a partnership or the trustee of a trust; and

     * (b) the entity is not a *corporate tax entity when the distribution is made; and

     * (c) if the entity is the trustee of a trust--the trust is not a *complying superannuation entity or *FHSA trust when the distribution is made;

    * the assessable income of the partnership or trust for that income year includes the amount of the *franking credit on the distribution.

    * (2) The amount is in addition to any other amount included in that assessable income in relation to the distribution under any other provision of this Act.

         * Note: The amount will affect the income tax liability of a partner in the partnership, or a beneficiary or the trustee of the trust: see Divisions 5 and 6 of Part III of the _Income Tax Assessment Act 1936_.

    * (3) Subsection (4) applies if:

     * (a) a *franked distribution is made, or *flows indirectly, to a partnership or the trustee of a trust in an income year; and

     * (b) the assessable income of the partnership or trust for that year includes an amount (the **_franking credit amount_**) that is all or a part of the additional amount of assessable income included under subsection (1) in relation to the distribution; and

     * (c) the distribution flows indirectly to an entity that is a partner in the partnership, or a beneficiary or the trustee of the trust; and

     * (d) disregarding Division 6E of Part III of the _Income Tax Assessment Act 1936_, the entity has an amount of assessable income for that year that is attributable to all or a part of the distribution.

    * (4) Despite any provisions in Divisions 5 and 6 of Part III of the _Income Tax Assessment Act 1936_, the entity's assessable income for that year also includes:

     * (a) in the case of an entity that is a partner in a partnership--so much of the franking credit amount as is equal to the entity's *share of the *franking credit on the distribution; and

     * (b) in the case of an entity that is a beneficiary of a trust:

       * (i) so much of the franking credit amount as is equal to the entity's share of the franking credit on the distribution; and

       * (ii) the amount mentioned in section 20737.

         * Example: A franked distribution of $70 is made to the trustee of a trust in an income year. The trust also has $100 of assessable income from other sources. Under subsection (1), the trust's assessable income includes an additional amount of $30 (which is the franking credit on the distribution). The trust has a net income of $200 for that income year.

         * There are 2 beneficiaries of the trust, P and Q, who are presently entitled to the trust's income. Under the trust deed, P is entitled to all of the franked distribution and Q is entitled to all other income.

         * The distribution flows indirectly to P (as P has a share of the trust's net income that is covered by paragraph 97(1)(a) and has a share of the distribution under section 20755 equal to 100% of the distribution).

         * Under this subsection, P's assessable income includes $70 (the amount mentioned in section 20737 (attributable franked distribution)) and also includes the full amount of the franking credit (as P's share of the franking credit on the distribution is $30 under section 20757). Q's assessable income does not include any of the amount of the franked distribution or the franking credit.

    * (5) Subsection (6) applies if:

     * (a) a *franked distribution is made, or *flows indirectly, to the trustee of a trust in an income year; and

     * (b) the assessable income of the trust for that year includes an amount (the **_franking credit amount_**) that is all or a part of the additional amount of assessable income included under subsection (1) in relation to the distribution; and

     * (c) disregarding Division 6E of Part III of the _Income Tax Assessment Act 1936_, the trustee of the trust is liable to be assessed (and pay tax) in respect of an amount (the **_assessable amount_**) under section 98, 99 or 99A of that Act in relation to the trust.

    * (6) Despite any provisions in Division 6 of Part III of the_ Income Tax Assessment Act 1936_, for the purposes of that Division, increase the assessable amount by so much of the franking credit amount as is equal to:

     * (a) if the trustee of the trust is liable to be assessed (and pay tax) under section 98 of that Act--the sum of:

       * (i) the trustee's *share of the *franking credit on the distribution in respect of the beneficiary; and

       * (ii) the amount mentioned in section 20737; or

     * (b) if the trustee of the trust is liable to be assessed (and pay tax) under section 99 or 99A of that Act--the sum of:

       * (i) the trustee's share of the franking credit on the distribution; and

       * (ii) the amount mentioned in section 20737.

##### 20737  Attributable franked distribution--trusts

    * (1) The amount is the product of:

     * (a) the amount of the *franked distribution (to the extent that an amount of the franked distribution remained after reducing it by deductions that were directly relevant to it); and

     * (b) the beneficiary's or the trustee's (as the case requires) *share of the franked distribution (see section 20755), divided by the amount of the franked distribution.

    * (2) Subsection (3) applies if the net income of the trust estate (disregarding the amount of any *franking credits) for the relevant income year falls short of the sum of:

     * (a) the *net capital gain (if any) of the trust estate for the income year; and

     * (b) the total of all *franked distributions (if any) included in the assessable income of the trust estate for the income year (to the extent that an amount of the franked distributions remained after reducing them by deductions that were directly relevant to them).

    * (3) For the purposes of subsection (1), replace paragraph (a) of that subsection with the following paragraph:

     * (a) the product of:

       * (i) the amount of the *franked distribution (to the extent that an amount of the franked distribution remained after reducing it by deductions that were directly relevant to it); and

       * (ii) the *net income of the trust estate for that income year (disregarding the amount of any *franking credits), divided by the sum mentioned in subsection (2); and

##### 20745  Tax offset--distribution flows indirectly to an entity

    * An entity to whom a *franked distribution *flows indirectly in an income year is entitled to a *tax offset for that income year that is equal to its *share of the *franking credit on the distribution, if it is:

     * (a) an individual; or

     * (b) a *corporate tax entity when the distribution flows indirectly to it; or

     * (c) the trustee of a trust that is liable to be assessed on a share of, or all or a part of, the trust's *net income under section 98, 99 or 99A of the _Income Tax Assessment Act 1936_ for that income year; or

     * (ca) the trustee of an *FHSA trust; or

     * (d) the trustee of a *complying superannuation fund, a *noncomplying superannuation fund, a *complying approved deposit fund, a *noncomplying approved deposit fund or a *pooled superannuation trust in relation to that income year.

         * Note: The entities covered by this section are the ultimate recipients of the distribution because the distribution does not flow indirectly through them to other entities. As a result they are also the ultimate taxpayers in respect of the distribution and are given the tax offset to acknowledge the income tax that has already been paid on the profits underlying the distribution.

##### Key concepts

##### 20750  When a franked distribution flows indirectly to or through an entity

    * (1) For the purposes of this Subdivision, this section sets out the only circumstances in which a *franked distribution:

     * (a) **_flows indirectly_** to an entity (subsection (2), (3) or (4)); or

     * (b) **_flows indirectly_** through an entity (subsection (5)).

    * Partners

    * (2) A *franked distribution **_flows indirectly _**to a partner in a partnership in an income year if, and only if:

     * (a) during that income year, the distribution is made to the partnership, or *flows indirectly to the partnership as a beneficiary because of a previous application of subsection (3); and

     * (b) the partner has an individual interest:

       * (i) in the partnership's *net income for that income year that is covered by paragraph 92(1)(a) or (b) of the _Income Tax Assessment Act 1936_; or

       * (ii) in a *partnership loss of the partnership for that income year that is covered by paragraph 92(2)(a) or (b) of that Act;

     * (whether or not that individual interest becomes assessable income in the hands of the partner); and

     * (c) the partner's *share of the distribution under section 20755 is a positive amount (whether or not the partner actually receives any of that share).

    * Beneficiaries

    * (3) A *franked distribution **_flows indirectly_** to a beneficiary of a trust in an income year if, and only if:

     * (a) during that income year, the distribution is made to the trustee of the trust, or *flows indirectly to the trustee as a partner or beneficiary because of a previous application of subsection (2) or this subsection; and

     * (b) the beneficiary has this amount for that income year (the **_share amount_**):

       * (i) a share of the trust's *net income for that income year that is covered by paragraph 97(1)(a) of the _Income Tax Assessment Act 1936_; or

       * (ii) an individual interest in the trust's net income for that income year that is covered by section 98A or 100 of that Act;

     * (whether or not the share amount becomes assessable income in the hands of the beneficiary); and

     * (c) the beneficiary's *share of the distribution under section 20755 is a positive amount (whether or not the beneficiary actually receives any of that share).

    * Trustees

    * (4) A *franked distribution **_flows indirectly _**to the trustee of a trust in an income year if, and only if:

     * (a) during that income year, the distribution is made to the trustee, or *flows indirectly to the trustee as a partner or beneficiary because of a previous application of subsection (2) or (3); and

     * (b) the trustee is liable or, but for another provision in this Act, would be liable, to be assessed in respect of an amount (the**_ share amount_**) that is:

       * (i) a share of the trust's *net income for that income year under section 98 of the _Income Tax Assessment Act 1936_; or

       * (ii) all or a part of the trust's net income for that income year under section 99 or 99A of that Act;

     * (whether or not the share amount becomes assessable income in the hands of the trustee); and

     * (c) the trustee's *share of the distribution under section 20755 is a positive amount (whether or not the trustee actually receives any of that share).

         * Note: A trustee to whom a franked distribution flows indirectly under this subsection is entitled to a tax offset under section 20745 and the distribution does not flow indirectly through the trustee to another entity.

    * (5) A *franked distribution **_flows indirectly _**through an entity (the **_first entity_**) to another entity if, and only if:

     * (a) the other entity is the focal entity in an item of the table in section 20755 in relation to the distribution; and

     * (b) that focal entity's *share of the distribution is based on the first entity's share of the distribution as an intermediary entity in that or another item of the table.

         * Example: A franked distribution of $140 is made to a partnership. An amount equal to the franking credit on the distribution ($60) is included in the partnership's assessable income under section 20735. Because the partnership has losses of $300 from other sources, it has a partnership loss of $100 for the income year.

         * The partnership has 2 equal partners. One partner is the trustee of a trust and the other partner is an individual. The distribution flows indirectly to each partner under subsection (2). Each partner has a share of the partnership loss ($50), a share of the distribution under sections 20755 ($70) and a share of the franking credit under section 20757 ($30).

         * The individual partner is allowed a tax offset of $30 under section 20745.

         * Because the trust has $100 of income from other sources, it has a net income of $50 for that income year ($100 minus the share of the partnership loss of $50).

         * The trust has one individual as a beneficiary, to whom the distribution flows indirectly under subsection (3). The beneficiary's share of the franked distribution is therefore $70 under sections 20755 and its share of the franking credit is $30 under section 20757. The beneficiary is also allowed a tax offset of $30 under section 20745.

##### 20755  Share of a franked distribution

    * Object of section

    * (1) The object of this section is to ensure that:

     * (a) the amount of a *franked distribution made to a partnership or the trustee of a trust is allocated notionally amongst entities who *derive benefits from that distribution; and

     * (b) that allocation corresponds with the way in which those benefits were derived.

         * Note: An entity can derive a benefit from the distribution (and therefore has a share of the distribution) without actually receiving any of the distribution: see subsection (2) of this section and the example at the end of section 20750.

    * (2) An entity's **_share_** of a *franked distribution is an amount notionally allocated to the entity as its share of the distribution, whether or not the entity actually receives any of that distribution.

    * (3) That amount is equal to the entity's **_share_** of the distribution as the focal entity in column 3 of an item of the table.

         * Note: An entity's share of the distribution is based on the share of the distribution of each preceding intermediary entity through which the distribution flows, starting from the intermediary entity to whom the distribution is made.

         * This means that in some cases (see items 2 and 4), more than one item of the table will need to be applied to work out the share of the distribution of an ultimate recipient of the distribution.

         * Note: In item 3 or 4, the trustee of a trust can be both the intermediary entity and the focal entity in the same item.

    * (4) For the purposes of column 3 of item 3 of the table in subsection (3), the amount is the sum of:

     * (a) so much of the amount worked out under column 2 of item 3 of the table in subsection (3) to which:

       * (i) unless subparagraph (ii) applies--the focal entity is *specifically entitled; or

       * (ii) if the focal entity is the trustee and has the share amount because of the operation of section 98 of the _Income Tax Assessment Act 1936_ in respect of a beneficiary (see subparagraph 20750(4)(b)(i))--the beneficiary is specifically entitled; and

     * (b) if there is an amount of the *franked distribution to which no beneficiary is specifically entitled--that amount multiplied by:

       * (i) unless subparagraph (ii) applies--the focal entity's *adjusted Division 6 percentage of the income of the trust for the relevant income year; or

       * (ii) if the focal entity is the trustee and has the share amount because of the operation of section 98 of the _Income Tax Assessment Act 1936_ in respect of a beneficiary (see subparagraph 20750(4)(b)(i))--the beneficiary's adjusted Division 6 percentage of the income of the trust for the relevant income year.

##### 20757  Share of the franking credit on a franked distribution

    * (1) An entity's **_share_** of a *franking credit on a *franked distribution is an amount notionally allocated to the entity as its share of that credit, whether or not the entity actually receives any of that credit or distribution.

    * (2) Work out that amount as follows:

##### 20758  Specifically entitled to an amount of a franked distribution

    * (1) A beneficiary of a trust estate is **_specifically entitled_** to an amount of a *franked distribution made to the trust estate in an income year equal to the amount calculated under the following formula:

    * where: 

    * **_net financial benefit_** means an amount equal to the *financial benefit that is referable to the *franked distribution (after any application by the trustee of expenses that are directly relevant to the franked distribution).

    * **_share of net financial benefit_** means an amount equal to the *financial benefit that, in accordance with the terms of the trust:

     * (a) the beneficiary has received, or can be reasonably expected to receive; and

     * (b) is referable to the *franked distribution (after application by the trustee of any expenses that are directly relevant to the franked distribution); and

     * (c) is recorded, in its character as referable to the franked distribution, in the accounts or records of the trust no later than the end of the income year.

    * (2) To avoid doubt, for the purposes of subsection (1), something is done in accordance with the terms of the trust if it is done in accordance with:

     * (a) the exercise of a power conferred by the terms of the trust; or

     * (b) the terms of the trust deed (if any), and the terms applicable to the trust because of the operation of legislation, the common law or the rules of equity.

##### 20759  Franked distributions within class treated as single franked distribution

    * (1) Subsection (2) applies if:

     * (a) a trust receives 2 or more *franked distributions in an income year; and

     * (b) all of the franked distributions that the trust receives in the income year are, in accordance with the terms of the trust, to the extent that they are distributed in that income year, distributed within a single class.

    * (2) For the purposes of this Subdivision and Division 6E of Part III of the _Income Tax Assessment Act 1936_, treat all of the *franked distributions that the trust receives in the income year as one single franked distribution.

    * (3) To avoid doubt, for the purposes of subsection (1), something is done in accordance with the terms of the trust if it is done in accordance with:

     * (a) the exercise of a power conferred by the terms of the trust; or

     * (b) the terms of the trust deed (if any), and the terms applicable to the trust because of the operation of legislation, the common law or the rules of equity.

##### Subdivision 207C--Residency requirements for the general rule

##### Guide to Subdivision 207C

##### 20760  What this Subdivision is about

    * Some recipients of a franked distribution must satisfy a residency requirement if their assessable income is to include the franking credit on the distribution, and they are to be entitled to a tax offset, under the general rule.

##### Table of sections

      * 20765	Satisfying the residency requirement

  * Operative provisions

      * 20770	Grossup and tax offset under section 20720

      * 20775	Residency requirement

##### 20765  Satisfying the residency requirement

    * (1) This Subdivision sets out the residency requirements that must be satisfied by an individual or a corporate tax entity that receives a franked distribution, if the franking credit on the distribution is to be included in that entity's assessable income, or the entity is to be entitled to a tax offset, under the general rule.

    * (2) It does not impose a residency requirement on other entities, because the significance of residency for those entities is dealt with elsewhere in this Act.

    * (3) It does not impose a residency requirement where a distribution flows indirectly to an entity. This is also because the significance of residency is dealt with elsewhere, for the most part in Divisions 5 and 6 of Part III of the _Income Tax Assessment Act 1936_.

##### Operative provisions

##### 20770  Grossup and tax offset under section 20720

    * If an entity makes a *franked distribution to an individual or a *corporate tax entity:

     * (a) no amount is included in the receiving entity's assessable income under subsection 20720(1); and

     * (b) the receiving entity is not entitled to a *tax offset under subsection 20720(2);

    * unless the receiving entity satisfies the *residency requirement at the time the distribution is made.

##### 20775  Residency requirement

    * (1) An entity that receives a *distribution satisfies the **_residency requirement_** at the time the distribution is made if:

     * (a) in the case of an individual--the individual is an Australian resident at that time; and

     * (b) in the case of a company--the company is an Australian resident at that time; and

     * (c) in the case of a *corporate limited partnership--the corporate limited partnership is an Australian resident at that time; and

     * (d) in the case of a *corporate unit trust--the corporate unit trust is a *resident unit trust for the income year in which that time occurs; and

     * (e) in the case of a *public trading trust--the public trading trust is a resident unit trust for the income year in which that time occurs.

    * (2) An entity that receives a *distribution also satisfies the **_residency requirement_** at the time the distribution is made if the entity at that time:

     * (a) is a company or an individual; and

     * (b) is a foreign resident; and

     * (c) carries on business in  at or through a permanent establishment of the entity in , being a permanent establishment within the meaning of:

       * (i) a double tax agreement (as defined in Part X of the _Income Tax Assessment Act 1936_) that relates to a foreign country and affects the entity; or

       * (ii) subsection 6(1) of that Act, if there is no such agreement;

    * and the distribution is attributable to the permanent establishment.

##### Subdivision 207D--No grossup or tax offset where distribution would not be taxed

##### Guide to Subdivision 207D

##### 20780  What this Subdivision is about

    * This Subdivision creates the appropriate adjustment to cancel the effect of the grossup and tax offset rules where a franked distribution (or a share of it) is, or would be, exempt income or *nonassessable nonexempt income in the relevant entity's hands (and therefore would not be taxed in any case).

##### Operative provisions

##### 20785  Applying this Subdivision

    * This Subdivision applies subject to Subdivisions 207E and 207F.

         * Note 1: Subdivision 207E sets out exceptions to the rules in this Subdivision.

         * Note 2: Where both this Subdivision and Subdivision 207F apply to an entity, the application of this Subdivision is subject to the rules in Subdivision 207F: see subsections 207145(3) and 207150(7) and (8).

##### 20790  Distribution that is made to an entity

    * Whole of distribution not assessable

    * (1) If:

     * (a) a *franked distribution is made to an entity; and

     * (b) the distribution does not *flow indirectly through the entity to another entity; and

     * (c) the distribution is *exempt income or *nonassessable nonexempt income in the hands of the entity;

    * then, for the purposes of this Act:

     * (d) the amount of the *franking credit on the distribution is not included in the assessable income of the entity under section 20720; and

     * (e) the entity is not entitled to a *tax offset under this Division because of the distribution.

    * Part of distribution not assessable

    * (2) If:

     * (a) a *franked distribution is made to an entity; and

     * (b) the distribution does not *flow indirectly through the entity to another entity; and

     * (c) a part of the distribution (the **_relevant part_**) is *exempt income or *nonassessable nonexempt income in the hands of the entity;

    * then, for the purposes of this Act:

     * (d) the amount of the distribution is taken to have been reduced by the relevant part; and

     * (e) the amount of the *franking credit on the distribution is to be worked out as follows:

##### 20795  Distribution that flows indirectly to an entity

    * Whole of share of distribution not assessable

    * (1) If:

     * (a) a *franked distribution *flows indirectly to an entity in an income year; and

     * (b) the entity's *share of the distribution would, in its hands, be *exempt income or *nonassessable nonexempt income (whether or not it had actually received that share);

    * then, for the purposes of this Act:

     * (c) subsection (2), (3) or (4) (as appropriate) applies to the entity in relation to that income year; and

     * (d) the entity is not entitled to a *tax offset under this Division because of the distribution; and

     * (e) if the distribution flows indirectly through the entity to another entity--subsection 20735(3) and section 20745 do not apply to that other entity.

         * Note: This section can therefore apply, for example, where the entity is a partner in a partnership that has a partnership loss and the entity does not actually receive any of the distribution.

    * Partner

    * (2) If the *franked distribution *flows indirectly to the entity as a partner in a partnership under subsection 20750(2), the entity can deduct an amount for that income year that is equal to its *share of the *franking credit on the distribution.

    * Beneficiary

    * (3) If the *franked distribution *flows indirectly to the entity as a beneficiary of a trust under subsection 20750(3), the entity can deduct an amount for that income year that is equal to the lesser of:

     * (a) its share amount in relation to the distribution that is mentioned in that subsection; and

     * (b) its *share of the *franking credit on the distribution.

    * Trustee

    * (4) If the *franked distribution *flows indirectly to the entity as the trustee of a trust under subsection 20750(4), the entity's share amount in relation to the distribution that is mentioned in that subsection is to be reduced by the lesser of:

     * (a) that share amount; and

     * (b) its *share of the *franking credit on the distribution.

         * Example: A franked distribution of $70 is made to a partnership.

         * Under section 20735, an additional amount of $30 is included in the partnership's assessable income because of the distribution.

         * The partnership has 2 equal partners, X and Y. X is a foreign resident individual whose share of partnership's net income for the income year is $50 (share of distribution of $35 and share of franking credit of $15). That share of distribution is not assessable income and not exempt income under section 128D of the _Income Tax Assessment Act 1936_.

         * X's assessable income of $15 (share of franking credit) is reduced to nil because of the deduction of $15 under subsection (2). Because of subsection (1), X is not entitled to a tax offset under section 20745.

    * Part of share of distribution not assessable

    * (5) If:

     * (a) a *franked distribution *flows indirectly to an entity in an income year; and

     * (b) a part of the entity's *share of the distribution (the **_relevant part_**) would, in its hands, be *exempt income or *nonassessable nonexempt income(whether or not it had actually received that part);

    * then, subsection (2), (3) or (4) (as appropriate) applies to the entity on the basis that the amount of its *share of the *franking credit on the distribution is worked out as follows:

    * (6) In addition, the following apply to an entity covered by subsection (5):

     * (a) if the distribution would otherwise *flow indirectly through the entity--the entity's *share of the distribution for the purposes of this Act (other than subsection (2), (3) or (4)) is to be reduced by the relevant part mentioned in subsection (5);

     * (b) if the entity would otherwise be entitled to a *tax offset under this Division because of the distribution--the amount of the tax offset is to be worked out as follows:

##### Subdivision 207E--Exceptions to the rules in Subdivision 207D

##### Guide to Subdivision 207E

##### 207105  What this Subdivision is about

    * Subdivision 207D does not apply to certain exempt institutions, trusts and life insurance companies as set out in this Subdivision. Such an entity may be entitled to a tax offset under this Subdivision in relation to a franked distribution.

##### Operative provisions

##### 207110  Effect of nonassessable income on gross up and tax offset

    * (1) This section applies to an entity to whom a *franked distribution is made, or *flows indirectly, in any of the following circumstances:

     * (b) the distribution is, or the entity's *share of the distribution would have been, this kind of income in its hands:

       * (i) *exempt income under section 295385 (about income from assets set aside to meet current pension liabilities), section 295390 (about income from other assets used to meet current pension liabilities) or section 295400 (about income of a PST attributable to current pension liabilities); or

       * (ii) *nonassessable nonexempt income under paragraph 32037(1)(a) (segregated exempt assets of a life insurance company) or paragraph 32037(1)(d) (certain amounts received by a friendly society) of this Act.

    * (2) The following have effect in relation to the entity:

     * (a) section 20790 or 20795 (as appropriate) does not apply to the entity;

     * (b) if the entity would, apart from section 20790 or 20795, be entitled to a *tax offset under section 20720 or 20745 in relation to the distribution--the entity is entitled to that tax offset;

     * (c) if the entity would not be entitled to such a tax offset, the entity is entitled to a tax offset under this section that is equal to:

       * (i) if the distribution is made to the entity--the *franking credit on the distribution; or

       * (ii) if the distribution *flows indirectly to the entity--the entity's *share of the franking credit on the distribution;

     * (d) if the distribution flows indirectly through the entity to another entity--subsection 20735(3) and section 20745 do not apply to that other entity.

         * Note: Paragraph (2)(c) only applies to an exempt institution that is eligible for a refund and that is not entitled to a tax offset under section 20720 or 20745. An entity covered by paragraph (1)(b) will, in all cases, be entitled to a tax offset under section 20720 or 20745.

##### 207120  Entity may be ineligible because of a distribution event

    * (1) This section applies to an entity (the **_ineligible entity_**) if:

     * (a) a *franked distribution is made, or *flows indirectly under subsection 20750(3) or (4), to the entity; and

     * (c) an *arrangement entered into in association with a matter mentioned in paragraph (a) or (b).

##### 207122  Entity may be ineligible if distribution is in the form of property other than money

    * This section applies to an entity (the **_ineligible entity_**) to whom a *franked distribution is made, or *flows indirectly under subsection 20750(3) or (4), if:

     * (a) one of the following is in the form of property other than money:

       * (i) if the distribution is made to the ineligible entity--all or part of the distribution;

       * (ii) if the distribution flows indirectly to the ineligible entity through the trustee of a trust under subsection 20750(3) or (4)--all or a part of a distribution (the **_trust distribution_**) made by the trustee of the trust that relates to the ineligible entity's *trust share amount in relation to the franked distribution; and

     * (b) the terms and conditions on which the franked distribution or trust distribution is made are such that the ineligible entity:

       * (i) does not receive immediate custody and control of the property; or

       * (ii) does not have the unconditional right to retain custody and control of the property in perpetuity; or

       * (iii) does not obtain an immediate, indefeasible and unencumbered legal and equitable title to the property.

##### 207124  Entity may be ineligible if other money or property also acquired

    * Subject to section 207128, this section applies to an entity (the **_ineligible entity_**) to whom a *franked distribution is made, or *flows indirectly under subsection 20750(3) or (4), if:

     * (a) the ineligible entity or another entity has entered into an *arrangement as part of, or in association with:

       * (i) the distribution; or

       * (ii) if the distribution flows indirectly to the ineligible entity--the ineligible entity's *trust share amount in relation to the distribution; and

     * (b) because of the arrangement, the ineligible entity or another entity has acquired or will acquire (whether directly or indirectly) money or property, other than money or property comprising the distribution or the ineligible entity's trust share amount, from:

       * (i) the entity making the distribution; or

       * (ii) an entity through which the distribution flows indirectly to the ineligible entity; or

##### 207126  Entity may be ineligible if distributions do not match trust share amounts

    * (1) This section applies to a beneficiary of a trust in relation to an income year if:

     * (a) the sum of the distributions:

       * (i) made to the beneficiary during the income year by the trustee of the trust; and

       * (ii) that relate to the beneficiary's *trust share amount in relation to a *franked distribution made during the income year;

    * is less than: 

     * (b) that trust share amount.

    * Commissioner's power to treat trust share amount as having been distributed during the income year

    * (2) Subsection (1) does not apply if the Commissioner, having regard to all the circumstances, considers that it would be reasonable to treat the *trust share amount as having been distributed to the beneficiary in the income year.

##### 207128  Reinvestment choice

    * (1) If, apart from this section, paragraph 207120(2)(a) or (d) or section 207124 would apply to an entity (the **_receiving entity_**) to whom a *franked distribution is made or *flows indirectly, that paragraph or section is taken not to apply to the receiving entity if:

     * (a) instead of receiving the distribution, or the *trust share amount concerned, by a payment of money, the receiving entity chooses to be issued with:

       * (i) if the distribution is made to the receiving entity--*shares in the *corporate tax entity making the distribution; or

       * (ii) if the distribution flows indirectly to the receiving entity--a fixed interest in the trust in relation to which the trust share amount arises; and

     * (b) the choice is genuine and furthers the purpose for which the entity was established; and

     * (c) the choice is not made for the purpose, or purposes that include the purpose, of benefiting the corporate tax entity, trust or any of their *associates (other than the receiving entity); and

     * (d) any benefit *derived by the corporate tax entity, trust or any of their associates (other than the receiving entity) because of that choice is one which is an ordinary incident of issuing the shares or interests to the receiving entity or of the receiving entity's holding of those shares or interests; and

     * (e) the parties that were involved in the *distribution event or *arrangement concerned deal with one another on an *arm's length basis in relation to the event or arrangement.

    * A vested and indefeasible interest constitutes a fixed interest

    * (2) The receiving entity's interest in a trust is a fixed interest if the interest is a vested and indefeasible interest in the trust's capital.

    * Special rule about whether interests in unit trusts are defeasible

    * (3) If:

     * (a) the trust is a unit trust and the receiving entity holds units in the unit trust; and

     * (b) the units are redeemable or further units are able to be issued; and

     * (c) the units held by the receiving entity will be redeemed, or any further units will be issued:

       * (i) if units in the unit trust are listed for quotation in the official list of an *approved stock exchange--for the price at which other units of the same kind in the unit trust are offered for sale on the exchange at the time of the redemption or issue; or

       * (ii) if the units are not listed as mentioned in subparagraph (i)--for their *market value at the time of the redemption or issue;

    * then the mere fact that the units are redeemable, or that the further units are able to be issued, does not mean that the receiving entity's interest, as a unit holder, in the trust's capital is defeasible.

    * Commissioner's power to treat an interest in a trust as being a fixed interest

    * (4) If:

     * (a) the receiving entity has an interest in the trust's capital; and

     * (b) apart from this subsection, the interest would not be a vested or indefeasible interest; and

     * (c) the Commissioner considers that the interest should be treated as being vested and indefeasible, having regard to:

       * (i) the circumstances in which the interest is capable of not vesting, or the defeasance can happen; and

       * (ii) the likelihood of the interest not vesting or the defeasance happening; and

       * (iii) the nature of the trust; and

       * (iv) any other matter the Commissioner thinks relevant;

    * the Commissioner may determine that the interest is to be taken to be vested and indefeasible.

    * (5) A determination made under subsection (4) has effect according to its terms.

##### 207130  Controller's liability

    * (1) A *controller (for imputation purposes) of an entity (the **_controlled entity_**) is liable to pay an amount under this section in respect of a refund paid to the controlled entity under Division 67 if:

     * (a) the controlled entity claimed the refund wholly or partly on the basis that:

       * (i) the controlled entity was entitled to a *tax offset under section 20720, 20745 or 207110 in relation to a *franked distribution; and

       * (ii) the controlled entity was an *exempt institution that is eligible for a refund; and

     * (b) because of the operation of section 207120, 207122, 207124 or 207126 in respect of a *distribution event or an *arrangement in relation to the distribution, the controlled entity is not entitled to the tax offset; and

     * (c) the controller or an *associate of the controller benefited from that event or arrangement; and

     * (d) some or all of the amount that the controlled entity is liable to pay in respect of the refund remains unpaid after the day on which the amount becomes due and payable; and

       * (ii) specifying that amount.

    * Except as provided for in subsection (5), this subsection does not affect any liability the controlled entity has in relation to the refund.

         * Note 1: Section 207134 also provides that the controlled entity's present entitlement to a trust share amount is disregarded for the purposes of Division 6 of Part III of the _Income Tax Assessment Act 1936_.

     * (a) the amounts that the Commissioner recovers under subsection (1) in relation to the refund from all of the controlled entity's *controllers (for imputation purposes); and

     * (b) the amounts that the Commissioner recovers in relation to the refund from the controlled entity;

    * must not exceed the amount that the controlled entity was liable to pay as mentioned in paragraph (1)(d).

    * Controller of a company

    * (5) An entity is a **_controller (for imputation purposes)_** of a company if the entity is a *controller of the company (for CGT purposes).

    * Controller of an entity other than a company--basic meaning

    * (6) Subject to subsections (7) and (8), an entity is a **_controller (for imputation purposes)_** of an entity other than a company (the **_controlled entity_**) if:

     * (d) the controlled entity or, if the controlled entity is a trust, the trustee of the trust:

       * (i) is accustomed; or

       * (ii) is under an obligation; or

       * (iii) might reasonably be expected;

     * to act in accordance with the directions, instructions or wishes of a group in relation to the entity; or

     * (e) if the controlled entity is a trust--a group in relation to the entity is able (directly or indirectly) to remove or appoint the trustee of the trust; or

     * (f) a group in relation to the entity has *more than a 50% stake in the income or capital of the controlled entity; or

     * (g) entities in a group in relation to the entity are the only entities that, under the terms of:

       * (i) the constitution of the controlled entity or the terms on which the controlled entity is established; or

       * (ii) if the controlled entity is a trust--the terms of the trust;

     * can obtain the beneficial enjoyment of the income or capital of the controlled entity.

     * (a) at a particular time, an entity (the **_first entity_**) would, but for this subsection, be a *controller (for imputation purposes) of an entity other than a company (the **_second entity_**); and

     * (b) the Commissioner, having regard to all relevant circumstances, considers that it is reasonable that the first entity be taken not to be such a controller of the second entity at the particular time;

    * the first entity is taken _not_ to be a controller (for imputation purposes) of the second entity at the particular time.

    * (9) Without limiting paragraph (8)(b), if the second entity is a trust, the Commissioner may have regard under that paragraph to the identity of the beneficiaries of the trust at any time (whether before or after the first entity began to be a *controller (for imputation purposes) of the second entity).

##### 207132  Treatment of benefits provided by an entity to a controller

    * (1) This section applies in relation to a benefit (the **_relevant benefit_**) given by an entity to a *controller (for imputation purposes) of the entity, or to an *associate of such a controller, if:

     * (a) the controller or associate:

       * (i) makes a *franked distribution to the entity; or

       * (ii) is the trustee of the trust in relation to which a *trust share amount of the entity arises in relation to a franked distribution that *flows indirectly to the entity; and

    * (2) For the purposes of paragraph 207120(2)(d), the controller or *associate is taken to have obtained the relevant benefit because of a *distribution event in relation to the *franked distribution or *trust share amount.

    * (3) For the purposes of paragraph 207130(1)(c), and at least to the extent of the relevant benefit, the controller or *associate is taken to have benefited from a *distribution event or *arrangement that caused section 207120 to apply in relation to the *franked distribution or *trust share amount.

    * Commissioner's power not to apply subsection (2) or (3)

    * (4) Subsection (2) or (3) does not apply in relation to a benefit if the Commissioner is satisfied, having regard to all the circumstances, that it would be unreasonable to apply that subsection.

##### 207134  Entity's present entitlement disregarded in certain circumstances

    * The present entitlement of a beneficiary of a trust to a share of trust income is disregarded for the purposes of Division 6 of Part III of the _Income Tax Assessment Act 1936_ if:

     * (a) the beneficiary has claimed a *tax offset under section 20745 or 207110 of this Act on the basis that the beneficiary was an *exempt institution that was eligible for a refund in relation to a *trust share amount that is that share of trust income; but

     * (b) the beneficiary was not entitled to that tax offset because of the operation of section 207120, 207122, 207124 or 207126 in respect of a *distribution event, or an *arrangement, to which the trust share amount is related.

         * Note: This means that the trustee of the trust is liable to pay income tax on that share of the trust income.

##### 207136  Review of certain decisions

##### Operative provisions

##### 207145  Distribution that is made to an entity

    * Whole of distribution manipulated

    * (1) If a *franked distribution is made to an entity in one or more of the following circumstances:

     * (a) the entity is not a qualified person in relation to the distribution for the purposes of Division 1A of former Part IIIAA of the _Income Tax Assessment Act 1936_;

     * (d) the distribution is made as part of a *dividend stripping operation;

     * (da) the distribution is one to which section 207157 (which is about distribution washing) applies;

    * then, for the purposes of this Act:

     * (e) the amount of the *franking credit on the distribution is not included in the assessable income of the entity under section 20720 or 20735; and

     * (f) the entity is not entitled to a *tax offset under this Division because of the distribution; and

     * (g) if the distribution *flows indirectly through the entity to another entity--subsection 20735(3) and section 20745 do not apply to that other entity.

    * Part of share of distribution manipulated

    * (2) If:

     * (a) a *franked distribution is made to an entity; and

     * (b) the Commissioner makes a determination under paragraph 177EA(5)(b) of the _Income Tax Assessment Act 1936_ that no imputation benefit (within the meaning of that section) is to arise in respect of a specified part of the distribution (the **_specified part_**) for the entity;

    * then, for the purposes of this Act:

     * (c) the amount of the distribution is taken to have been reduced by the specified part; and

     * (d) the amount of the *franking credit on the distribution is to be worked out as follows:

         * Example: A franked distribution of $70 is made to the trustee of a trust. Apart from this section, the franking credit on the distribution ($30) would be included in the assessable income of the trust under section 20735.

         * The Commissioner has made a determination under paragraph 177EA(5)(b) of the _Income Tax Assessment Act 1936_ that no imputation benefit (within the meaning of that section) is to arise for the trustee in respect of $49 of the distribution.

         * Under this subsection, the amount included in the assessable income of the trust under section 20735 because of the distribution is reduced from $30 to $9.

         * If there is a beneficiary of the trust that is presently entitled to the trust's income, the amount of the distribution that flows indirectly to the beneficiary is reduced from $70 to $21 under this subsection.

    * What happens if both subsection 20790(2) and subsection (2) of this section would apply

    * (3) If, apart from this subsection, both subsection 20790(2) and subsection (2) of this section would apply to an entity in relation to a *franked distribution, then:

     * (a) apply subsection 20790(2) first; and

     * (b) apply subsection (2) of this section on the basis that the amount of the *franked distribution had been reduced under subsection 20790(2).

##### 207150  Distribution that flows indirectly to an entity

    * Whole of share of distribution manipulated

    * (1) If a *franked distribution *flows indirectly to an entity in an income year in one or more of the following circumstances:

     * (a) the entity is not a qualified person in relation to the distribution for the purposes of Division 1A of former Part IIIAA of the _Income Tax Assessment Act 1936_;

     * (c) the Commissioner has made a determination under paragraph 20430(3)(c) of this Act that no *imputation benefit is to arise in respect of the distribution for the entity;

     * (d) the distribution is treated as an interest payment for the entity under section 207160 of this Act;

     * (e) the distribution is made as part of a *dividend stripping operation;

     * (ea) the distribution is one to which section 207157 (which is about distribution washing) applies;

    * then, for the purposes of this Act:

     * (f) subsection (2), (3) or (4) (as appropriate) applies to the entity in relation to that income year; and

     * (g) the entity is not entitled to a *tax offset under this Division because of the distribution; and

     * (h) if the distribution *flows indirectly through the entity to another entity--subsection 20735(3) and section 20745 do not apply to that other entity.

    * Partner

    * (2) If the *franked distribution *flows indirectly to the entity as a partner in a partnership under subsection 20750(2), the entity can deduct an amount for that income year that is equal to its *share of the *franking credit on the distribution.

    * Beneficiary

    * (3) If the *franked distribution *flows indirectly to the entity as a beneficiary of a trust under subsection 20750(3), the entity can deduct an amount for that income year that is equal to the lesser of:

     * (a) its share amount in relation to the distribution that is mentioned in that subsection; and

     * (b) its *share of the *franking credit on the distribution.

    * Trustee

    * (4) If the *franked distribution *flows indirectly to the entity as the trustee of a trust under subsection 20750(4), the entity's share amount in relation to the distribution that is mentioned in that subsection is to be reduced by the lesser of:

     * (a) that share amount; and

     * (b) its *share of the *franking credit on the distribution.

    * Part of share of distribution manipulated

    * (5) If:

     * (a) a *franked distribution *flows indirectly to an entity in an income year; and

     * (b) the Commissioner has made a determination under paragraph 177EA(5)(b) of the _Income Tax Assessment Act 1936_ that no imputation benefit (within the meaning of that section) is to arise in respect of a specified part of the distribution (the **_specified part_**) for the entity;

    * then, subsection (2), (3) or (4) (as appropriate) applies to the entity on the basis that the amount of its *share of the *franking credit on the distribution is worked out as follows:

    * (6) In addition, the following apply to an entity covered by subsection (5):

     * (a) if the distribution would otherwise *flow indirectly through the entity--the entity's *share of the distribution for the purposes of this Act (other than subsection (2), (3) or (4)) is to be reduced by the specified part mentioned in subsection (5);

     * (b) if the entity would otherwise be entitled to a *tax offset under this Division because of the distribution--the amount of the tax offset is to be worked out as follows:

         * Example: X is a partner in a partnership to which a franked distribution of $140 is made. The franking credit on the distribution ($60) is included in the assessable income of the partnership under section 20735. X's share of the distribution is $70 and its share of the franking credit on the distribution is $30.

         * The Commissioner has made a determination under paragraph 177EA(5)(b) of the _Income Tax Assessment Act 1936_ that no imputation benefit (within the meaning of that section) is to arise for X in respect of $42 of the distribution.

         * Under subsection (5), X will be allowed a deduction of $18.

         * X is the trustee of a trust and the distribution will flow indirectly through X to beneficiaries of the trust. For the purposes of working out a beneficiary's share of the distribution and its share of the franking credit, X's share of the franked distribution is reduced to $28 under this subsection.

    * What happens if both subsection 20795(1) and subsection (1) of this section would apply

    * (7) If, apart from this subsection, both subsection 20795(1) and subsection (1) of this section would apply to an entity in relation to a *franked distribution, then:

     * (a) subsection (1) of this section applies to the entity; but

     * (b) subsection 20795(1) does not apply to the entity.

    * What happens if both subsection 20795(5) and subsection (5) of this section would apply

    * (8) If, apart from this subsection, both subsection 20795(5) and subsection (5) of this section would apply to an entity in relation to a *franked distribution, then:

     * (a) apply subsections 20795(5) and (6) first; and

     * (b) apply subsections (5) and (6) of this section on the basis that:

       * (i) the amount of the entity's *share of the *franking credit on the distribution had been reduced under subsection 20795(5); and

       * (ii) the amount of the entity's *share of the distribution had been reduced under subsection 20795(6).

##### 207155  When is a distribution made as part of a dividend stripping operation?

    * A distribution made to a *member of a *corporate tax entity is taken to be made as part of a **_dividend stripping operation _**if, and only if, the making of the distribution arose out of, or was made in the course of, a *scheme that:

     * (a) was by way of, or in the nature of, dividend stripping; or

     * (b) had substantially the effect of a scheme by way of, or in the nature of, dividend stripping.

##### 207157  Distribution washing

    * (1) This section applies to a *franked distribution received by a *member of a *corporate tax entity on a *membership interest (the **_washed interest_**) if:

     * (a) the washed interest was acquired after the member, or a *connected entity of the member, disposed of a substantially identical membership interest; and

     * (b) a corresponding franked distribution is made to the member, or the connected entity, on the substantially identical interest.

    * Further requirement for connected entities

    * (2) However, if the entity that disposed of the substantially identical interest was a *connected entity of the member, this section does not apply to the *franked distribution unless:

     * (a) it would be concluded that the disposal took place wholly or partly because there was an expectation that the acquisition would, or would be likely to, take place; or

     * (b) it would be concluded that the acquisition took place wholly or partly because there was a belief that the disposal had taken place.

    * Substantially identical interests

    * (3) Without limiting paragraph (1)(a), for the purpose of that paragraph a *membership interest is substantially identical to the washed interest if it is any one or more of the following:

     * (a) fungible with, or economically equivalent to, the washed interest;

     * (b) a membership interest in the same *corporate tax entity as the washed interest and of a class that is the same as, or not materially different from, the washed interest;

     * (c) a membership interest in the same corporate tax entity as the washed interest and of a class that is exchangeable at a fixed rate for an interest of the same class as the washed interest;

     * (d) a membership interest in another corporate tax entity that holds predominantly membership interests that are covered by any of the preceding paragraphs;

    * Exception for individuals who are small holders

    * (4) Despite subsection (1), this section does not apply to a *franked distribution made to an individual in an income year if the sum of the *tax offsets to which the individual would be entitled, worked out on the basis mentioned in subsection (5), is $5000 or less.

    * (5) Work out the sum of the *tax offsets:

     * (a) disregarding this Subdivision, to the extent it applies to the individual; and

     * (b) not disregarding this Subdivision, to the extent it applies to any other entity through which a *franked distribution *flows indirectly to the individual.

##### 207160  Distribution that is treated as an interest payment

    * (1) For the purposes of this Subdivision, a *franked distribution is treated as an **_interest payment_** for an entity to whom the distribution *flows indirectly if:

     * (a) all or a part of the entity's individual interest or share amount in relation to the distribution that is mentioned in subsection 20750(2), (3) or (4) could reasonably be regarded as the payment of interest on a loan, having regard to:

       * (i) the way in which that individual interest or share amount was calculated; and

       * (ii) the conditions applying to the payment or application of that individual interest or share amount; and

       * (iii) any other relevant matters; and

     * (b) the entity's interest in the last intermediary entity (see subsection (2)):

       * (i) was acquired, or was acquired for a period that was extended, at or after 7.30 pm by legal time in the Australian Capital Territory on 13 May 1997; or

       * (ii) was acquired as part of a *financing arrangement for the entity (including an arrangement extending to an earlier arrangement) that was entered into at or after that time.

    * (2) The entity's interest in the last intermediary entity is:

     * (a) if the distribution *flows indirectly to the entity as a partner in a partnership under subsection 20750(2)--the entity's interest in the partnership; or

     * (b) if the distribution flows indirectly to the entity as a beneficiary of a trust under subsection 20750(3)--the entity's interest in the trust; or

     * (c) if the distribution flows indirectly to the entity as the trustee of a trust under subsection 20750(4)--the entity's interest in the trust in respect of which the entity is liable to be assessed.

##### 2085  What is an exempting entity?

    * (1) An exempting entity is a corporate tax entity that is effectively owned by entities that, either because they are not Australian residents or because they receive distributions as exempt income or nonassessable nonexempt income, would not be able to fully utilise franking credits on distributions by the corporate tax entity.

    * (2) In deciding whether a corporate tax entity is effectively owned by such entities, these rules:

     * (a) look at the membership interests in the entity that involve the holder of the interest in bearing the risks and accruing the opportunities of ownership of the entity; and

     * (b) ask whether at least 95% of those membership interests, and 95% of any interests in those membership interests, are held by Australian residents or entities that receive distributions as exempt income or nonassessable nonexempt income.

##### 20810  Former exempting entities

    * When an entity ceases to be an exempting entity, it becomes a former exempting entity.

##### 20815  Distributions by exempting entities and former exempting entities

    * To ensure that franking credits accumulated by an exempting entity are not the target of franking credit trading, these rules:

     * (a) limit the circumstances in which a distribution franked with those credits can give rise to benefits under the imputation system; and

     * (b) quarantine those credits by moving them into a separate account, called the exempting account, when the entity ceases to be an exempting entity; and

     * (c) deny a recipient of a distribution franked with a credit from that account any benefit under the imputation system as a result of that distribution, unless the recipient was a member of the entity immediately before it became a former exempting entity.

##### 20820  Exempting entities

    * A *corporate tax entity is an **_exempting entity_** at a particular time if, at that time, the entity is effectively owned by prescribed persons.

         * Note: Prescribed persons are identified in sections 20840 and 20845.

##### 20825  Effective ownership of entity by prescribed persons

    * (1) An entity is **_effectively owned by prescribed persons_** at a particular time if:

     * (a) at that time:

       * (i) not less than 95% of the *accountable membership interests in the entity; or

       * (ii) not less than 95% of the *accountable partial interests in the entity;

     * are held by, or held indirectly for the benefit of, prescribed persons; or

     * (b) paragraph (a) does not apply but it would nevertheless be reasonable to conclude that, at that time, the risks involved in, and the opportunities resulting from, holding accountable membership interests, or accountable partial interests, in the entity that are not held by, or directly or indirectly for the benefit of, prescribed persons are substantially borne by, or substantially accrue to, prescribed persons.

    * (2) In deciding whether it would be reasonable to conclude as mentioned in paragraph (1)(b):

     * (a) have regard to any *arrangement in respect of *membership interests (including unissued membership interests), or in respect of *partial interests, in the entity (including any derivatives held or issued in connection with those membership interests or partial interests) of which the entity is aware; but

     * (b) do not have regard to risks involved in the ownership of membership interests, or partial interests, in the entity that are substantially borne by any person in the person's capacity as a secured creditor.

    * (3) An entity has a **_partial interest _**in a *corporate tax entity if it has an interest in a *membership interest in the corporate tax entity.

##### 20830  Accountable membership interests

    * (1) The purpose of this section is to identify which *membership interests in an entity are relevant in determining whether the entity is effectively owned by prescribed persons.

    * (2) A *membership interest in an entity is an **_accountable membership interest_** if it is not an excluded membership interest.

    * (3) A *membership interest in an entity is an **_excluded membership interest_** if, having regard to:

     * (a) the purposes for which the membership interest was issued; and

     * (b) any special or limited rights connected with, arising from, or attached to:

       * (i) the membership interest; or

       * (ii) other membership interests in the entity held by the holder of the membership interest; or

       * (iii) membership interests in the entity held by persons other than the holder of the membership interest; or

       * (iv) interests in any of the above;

     * including rights that are conferred or exercisable only if the holder of the membership interest or interests concerned is, or is not, a prescribed person; and

     * (c) the extent to which any such special or limited rights are similar to or differ from the rights that are normally attached to the ownership of *ordinary membership interests in *corporate tax entities; and

     * (d) the relationship between the value of the membership interest and the value of the entity; and

     * (e) any relationship or connection (whether of a personal or business nature) between holders of membership interests in the entity of which the entity is aware; and

     * (f) any *arrangement in respect of membership interests (including unissued membership interests) in the entity, or interests in membership interests in the entity, of which the entity is aware;

    * it would be reasonable to conclude that the membership interest is not relevant in determining whether the entity is effectively owned by prescribed persons because holding the membership interest does not involve the holder bearing the risks, or result in the accrual to the holder of the opportunities, of ownership of the entity that ordinarily arise from, or are ordinarily attached to, the holding of ordinary membership interests in an entity.

    * (4) In applying subsection (3), the fact that a person is a trustee is to be disregarded.

    * (5) Without limiting subsection (3), a *membership interest in an entity held by a person who is not a prescribed person is an **_excluded membership interest_** if:

     * (a) it is a finance membership interest; or

     * (b) it is a distribution access membership interest; or

     * (c) it does not carry the right to receive distributions; or

     * (d) it was issued, transferred or acquired for a purpose (other than an incidental purpose) of ensuring that the entity is not effectively owned by prescribed persons.

    * (6) A *membership interest is a **_finance membership interest_** if:

     * (a) the membership interest is a *nonequity share in the entity; or

     * (b) having regard to the rights attached to the membership interest and to any *arrangement with respect to the membership interest of which the entity is aware, the membership interest is equivalent to a debt owed by the entity to the holder of the membership interest.

    * (7) A *membership interest to which subsection (6) does not apply is a **_finance membership interest_** if:

     * (a) the manner in which the *distributions payable in respect of the membership interest are calculated, and the conditions applying to the payment of such distributions, indicate that the distributions paid are equivalent to the receipt by the person to whom they are paid of interest or an amount in the nature of or similar to interest; or

     * (b) the capital invested by the holder of the membership interest will be redeemed or, because of an *arrangement between the holder and the entity or an *associate of the entity, it is reasonable for the holder to expect that the capital will be redeemed, for an amount that is not less than, or for property (including other membership interests in the entity) the value of which is not less than, the amount paid for the membership interest; or

     * (c) the membership interest is redeemable by the entity by payment of a lump sum or by the transfer of property, or the membership interest has a preferred right to a repayment of capital on a winding up, where the amount of the lump sum or the value of the property, or the amount of the capital to be repaid, as the case may be, is to be calculated by reference to an implicit interest rate.

    * (8) A *membership interest in an entity is a **_distribution access membership interest_** if, having regard to:

     * (a) the terms of the issue of the membership interest, including any guarantee of payment of distributions; and

     * (b) the amounts of the *distributions paid on the membership interest relative to the issue price of the membership interest; and

     * (c) whether there is any guaranteed rate at which *franked distributions are to be paid on the membership interest; and

     * (d) the duration of the period within which the membership interest was issued; and

     * (e) the rights attached to other membership interests in the entity; and

     * (f) any other relevant matters;

    * it could be concluded that the membership interest was issued only for the purpose of paying distributions to the holder of the membership interest.

##### 20835  Accountable partial interests

    * (1) The purpose of this section is to identify which *partial interests in an entity are relevant in determining whether the entity is effectively owned by prescribed persons.

    * (2) A *partial interest in an entity is an **_accountable partial interest_** if it is not an excluded partial interest.

    * (3) A *partial interest in an entity is an **_excluded partial interest_** if, having regard to:

     * (a) the purposes for which the interest was granted; and

     * (b) the nature of the interest; and

     * (c) any special or limited rights connected with or arising from:

       * (i) the interest; or

       * (ii) other *membership interests, or partial interests, in the entity held by the holder of the interest; or

       * (iii) membership interests, or partial interests, in the entity held by persons other than the holder of the interest;

     * including rights that are conferred or exercisable only if the holder of the membership interests or partial interests concerned is, or is not, a prescribed person; and

     * (d) the extent to which the interest is similar to or differs from beneficial ownership; and

     * (e) the relationship between the value of the interest and the value of the entity; and

     * (f) any relationship or connection (whether of a personal or business nature) between holders of partial interests in the entity, and the holders of membership interests in the entity, of which the entity is aware; and

     * (g) any *arrangement in respect of membership interests (including unissued membership interests) in the entity, or partial interests in the entity, of which the entity is aware;

    * it would be reasonable to conclude that the partial interest is not relevant in determining whether the entity is effectively owned by prescribed persons because holding the membership interest to which the partial interest relates does not involve the holder bearing the risks, or result in the accrual to the holder of the opportunities, of ownership of the entity that ordinarily arise from, or are ordinarily attached to, the holding of *ordinary membership interests in an entity.

    * (4) In applying subsection (3), the fact that a person is a trustee is to be disregarded.

    * (5) Without limiting subsection (3), a *partial interest in an entity is also an **_excluded partial interest_** if it was granted or otherwise created, or was transferred or acquired, for a purpose (other than an incidental purpose) of ensuring that the entity is not effectively owned by prescribed persons.

##### 20840  Prescribed persons

    * (1) A company is a **_prescribed person_** in relation to another *corporate tax entity if:

     * (a) the company is a foreign resident; or

    * (2) A trustee is a **_prescribed person_** in relation to a *corporate tax entity if:

     * (a) all the beneficiaries in the trust are prescribed persons under other provisions of this section; or

##### 20845  Persons who are taken to be prescribed persons

    * (1) This section applies to a person that:

     * (a) is a company, a trustee, or a partnership, that holds *membership interests (whether *accountable membership interests or excluded membership interests), or *partial interests (whether *accountable partial interests or excluded partial interests), in a *corporate tax entity (the **_relevant entity_**); and

     * (b) is not a prescribed person under section 20840.

    * (2) A company that holds *membership interests, or *partial interests, in the relevant entity is taken to be a **_prescribed person_** in relation to the relevant entity if the risks involved in, and the opportunities resulting from, holding the membership interests or partial interests are substantially borne by, or substantially accrue to, as the case may be, one or more prescribed persons.

    * (3) A trustee of a trust who holds *membership interests, or *partial interests, in the relevant entity is taken to be a **_prescribed person_** in relation to the relevant entity if the risks involved in, and the opportunities resulting from, holding the membership interests or partial interests are substantially borne by, or substantially accrue to, as the case may be, one or more prescribed persons.

    * (4) A trustee of a trust who holds *membership interests, or *partial interests, in the relevant entity is taken to be a **_prescribed person_** in relation to the relevant entity if:

     * (b) all the beneficiaries who are presently entitled to, or during the relevant income year become presently entitled to, income from the trust are prescribed persons.

    * (5) In determining whether subsection (3) or (4) applies in respect of a trust that is controlled by a person, have regard to the way in which the person, or any *associate of the person, exercises powers in relation to the trust.

    * (6) A person **_controls a trust_** if:

    * (7) Paragraph (4)(a) does not apply in relation to a trust if some of the beneficiaries receiving income from the trust are not prescribed persons and the Commissioner considers that it is reasonable to conclude that the risks involved in, and the opportunities resulting from, holding the *membership interests or *partial interests in the relevant entity are substantially borne by, or substantially accrue to, as the case may be, one or more persons who are not prescribed persons.

    * (8) A partnership that holds *membership interests, or *partial interests, in the relevant entity is taken to be a **_prescribed person_** in relation to the relevant entity if the risks involved in, and the opportunities resulting from, holding the membership interests or partial interests are substantially borne by, or substantially accrue to, as the case may be, one or more prescribed persons.

     * (c) the respective proportions:

       * (i) that accountable membership interests in each of the entities held by the persons mentioned in paragraph (1)(b) or their associates, and other accountable membership interests in the entity concerned, bear to all the accountable membership interests in that entity; and

     * (a) if the *member was a person referred to in any of paragraphs (3)(a) to (d)--the member; or

     * (b) if the member was a trustee of a trust or a partnership, being a trust or partnership in which a person referred to in any of those paragraphs held an interest--the holder of the interest;

    * would (if a foreign resident) be exempt from *withholding tax on the distribution or (if an Australian resident) be entitled to a *franking credit or a *tax offset in respect of the distribution.

     * (a) the relevant former exempting entity was an *exempting entity at the time it made the *distribution; and

     * (b) the distribution was a *franked distribution made to the member; and

     * (c) if the *member was a *former exempting entity--the member was an exempting entity; and

     * (d) if the member was a trustee of a trust or partnership in which a former exempting entity had an interest--the former exempting entity was an exempting entity.

    * A *distribution *franked with an exempting credit is taken to **_flow indirectly _**to an entity if, had it been a *franked distribution, it would have been taken to have flowed indirectly to the entity under section 20750.

##### 208180  What is an entity's share of the exempting credit on a distribution?

    * To work out an entity's **_share_** of the *exempting credit on a *distribution *franked with that credit, use sections 20755 and 20757 to work out what the entity's share of the credit would be it if were a *franking credit on a *franked distribution. The entity's share of the exempting credit is equal to that amount.

##### 208185  Minister may convert exempting surplus to franking credit of former exempting entity previously owned by the Commonwealth

     * (b) the extent to which the success of the sale or proposed sale depended or will depend upon the ability of the entity to make *franked distributions; and

     * (c) the extent to which the reduction in receipts of income tax resulting from the making of the determination or determinations would be offset by the receipt of increased proceeds from the sale; and

     * (d) any other matters that the Minister thinks relevant.

##### 2101  Purpose of venture capital franking

    * The purpose of these rules is to encourage venture capital investment by superannuation funds and other entities that deal with superannuation.

##### 2105  How is this achieved?

    * This is done by giving tax benefits to those entities when they invest in PDFs, which are the vehicles for venture capital investment. If the PDF makes a distribution franked with a venture capital credit, the relevant venture capital investor receives a certain part of a distribution from the PDF as exempt income and, in addition, is entitled to a tax offset equal to the venture capital credit.

##### 21010  What is a venture capital credit?

    * (1) There is a venture capital franking subaccount in the franking account of each PDF.

    * (2) Venture capital credits arise in the subaccount if the PDF pays income tax that is reasonably attributable to capital gains from venture capital investments.

##### 21015  What does the PDF have to do to distribute the credits?

    * Only a participating PDF can distribute venture capital credits. A PDF elects to participate by keeping a record of its venture capital subaccount.

##### 21020  Limits on venture capital franking

    * (1) The venture capital credit on a distribution cannot exceed the franking credit on the distribution. It is, in this sense, a species of franking credit.

    * (2) A PDF can only distribute venture capital credits if it does it so that all members of the PDF receive venture capital credits in proportion to their holdings.

    * (3) If a PDF has a venture capital surplus when it makes a distribution, it must frank the distribution with venture capital credits.

    * (4) There are measures to ensure that a PDF does not maintain a venture capital deficit over a prolonged period.

##### 21070  Additional information to be included when a distribution is franked with a venture capital credit

    * (1) A *participating PDF that makes a *distribution *franked with a venture capital credit must include in the *distribution statement given to the recipient:

     * (a) a statement that there is a *venture capital credit of a specified amount on the distribution; and

     * (b) a statement to the effect that the venture capital credit is only relevant for a taxpayer who is:

       * (i) the trustee of a fund that is a *complying superannuation fund in relation to the income year in which the distribution is made and is not a *self managed superannuation fund; or

       * (ii) the trustee of a fund that is a *complying approved deposit fund in relation to the income year in which the distribution is made and is not a self managed superannuation fund; or

       * (iii) the trustee of a unit trust that is a *pooled superannuation trust in relation to the income year in which the distribution is made; or

       * (iv) a *life insurance company.

    * (2) If, under subsection (1), a statement must be included in a *distribution statement, the distribution statement is taken not to have been given unless the statement is included.

##### Subdivision 210F--Rules affecting the allocation of venture capital credits

##### Guide to Subdivision 210F

##### 21075  What this Subdivision is about

    * If a PDF has a venture capital surplus when it makes a distribution frankable with venture capital credits, it must frank the distribution with venture capital credits.

      * 21081	Distributions to be franked with venture capital credits to the same extent

      * 21082	Consequences of breaching the rule in section 21081

##### Operative provisions

##### 21080  Draining the venture capital surplus when a distribution frankable with venture capital credits is made

    * (1) If a *participating PDF would otherwise have a *venture capital surplus at the time a *distribution that is *frankable with a venture capital credit is made, the PDF must either:

     * (a) allocate a *venture capital credit to the distribution that is equal to the *franking credit on the distribution; or

     * (b) allocate a venture capital credit to the distribution that either alone or when added to venture capital credits allocated to other distributions made under the resolution of the PDF under which the distribution in question is made, reduces the surplus to nil, or creates a *venture capital deficit.

    * (2) A *venture capital debit arises for a *participating PDF when a *distribution is made if the PDF does not allocate a *venture capital credit in accordance with subsection (1). The amount of the debit is:

    * where: 

    * **_actual franked amount_** is the amount of the *venture capital credit that is allocated to the *distribution by the PDF (this may be nil).

    * **_subsection (1) franked amount_** is the amount of the *venture capital credit that would have been allocated to the *distribution if the PDF had made the smallest allocation needed to satisfy subsection (1).

##### 21081  Distributions to be franked with venture capital credits to the same extent

    * (1) If a *PDF *franks a *distribution with a venture capital credit, it must frank each other distribution made under the same resolution with a venture capital credit worked out using the same venture capital percentage.

    * (2) The **_venture capital percentage _**for a *distribution is worked out using the formula:

##### 21082  Consequences of breaching the rule in section 21081

    * If a *PDF *franks a *distribution with a venture capital credit in breach of section 21081:

     * (a) the distribution is taken not to have been franked with a venture capital credit; and

     * (b) each other distribution made under the same resolution is taken not to have been franked with a venture capital credit.

##### Subdivision 210G--Venture capital subaccount

##### Guide to Subdivision 210G

##### 21085  What this Subdivision is about

    * This Subdivision: 

     *  	creates a venture capital subaccount for each PDF; and

     *  	identifies when venture capital credits and debits arise in the subaccount and the amount of those credits and debits; and

     *  	identifies when there is a venture capital surplus or deficit in the subaccount; and

     *  	creates a liability to pay venture capital deficit tax if the account is in deficit at certain times.

      * 210150	Deferring venture capital deficit

##### 21090  The venture capital subaccount

    * (1) Each PDF has a venture capital subaccount in its franking account. The subaccount exists even if the PDF does not elect to become a participating PDF by keeping a record of it.

    * (2) To the extent that income tax is reasonably attributable to capital gains from venture capital investments, it generates a venture capital credit in the subaccount. There are other circumstances in which a venture capital credit arises.

    * (3) If a PDF receives a refund of that tax, a venture capital debit will arise for the PDF. There are other circumstances in which a venture capital debit will arise, such as on the payment of a distribution franked with a venture capital credit.

##### 21095  Venture capital deficit tax

    * (1) Venture capital deficit tax is payable if a PDF's venture capital subaccount is in deficit at the end of the PDF's income year, or immediately before it ceases to be a PDF.

    * (2) A PDF's venture capital subaccount may be in deficit, even if its franking account is not. This can happen because only income tax on income of a particular kind (capital gains on venture capital investments) gives rise to venture capital credits. This means that when a PDF anticipates a venture capital credit, it is not only anticipating that income tax will be paid, but that income tax on income of that kind will be paid. Although income tax may, in fact, later be paid, it will not necessarily be income of the kind that would give rise to a venture capital credit. This results in franking credits arising even while the venture capital subaccount remains in deficit.

    * (3) The discrepancy between the franking account balance and the venture capital subaccount balance can also arise because venture capital credits do not necessarily arise at the same time as the relevant franking credits and debits (see item 1 of the table in section 210105 and item 2 of the table in section 210120).

##### Operative provisions

##### 210100  Venture capital subaccount

    * Each *PDF has a **_venture capital subaccount_** within its *franking account.

         * Note: The balance in the venture capital subaccount on 1 July 2002 will be either nil or, if the entity has a venture capital surplus or deficit immediately before 1 July 2002 under the imputation scheme existing at that time, an amount calculated under the _Income Tax (Transitional Provisions) Act 1997_.

##### 210105  Venture capital credits

    * The table sets out when a credit arises in the *venture capital subaccount of a *PDF. A credit in a PDF's venture capital subaccount is called a **_venture capital credit_**.

##### 210110  Determining the extent to which a franking credit is reasonably attributable to a particular payment of tax

    * In determining the extent to which a *franking credit is reasonably attributable to a *CGT event in relation to a *qualifying SME investment of the *PDF, have regard to:

     * (a) the extent to which the credit can reasonably be attributed to the *payment of a PAYG instalment or the payment of income tax by the PDF in relation to its *section 124ZZB SME assessable income for an income year; and

     * (b) the extent to which the section 124ZZB SME assessable income can reasonably be attributed to the CGT event.

##### 210115  Participating PDF may elect to have venture capital credits arise on its assessment day

    * (1) Before a *PDF's assessment day for an income year, the PDF may elect to have the *venture capital credits that arise because of the *payment of PAYG instalments and income tax during that income year arise on the assessment day.

    * (2) The *PDF's **_assessment day _**for an income year is the earlier of:

     * (a) the day on which the PDF furnishes its *income tax return for the income year; or

     * (b) the day on which the Commissioner makes an assessment of the amount of the PDF's taxable income for that year under section 166 of the _Income Tax Assessment Act 1936_.

##### 210120  Venture capital debits

    * The table sets out when a debit arises in the *venture capital subaccount of a *PDF. A debit in a PDF's venture capital subaccount is called a **_venture capital debit_**.

##### 210125  Venture capital debit where CGT limit is exceeded

    * (1) A *venture capital debit arises for a *PDF where the PDF's net venture capital credits for the income year exceed whichever is the lesser of:

     * (a) the PDF's CGT limit for that income year; and

     * (b) the tax paid by the PDF on its *SME income component for that income year.

    * Net venture capital credits

    * (2) The *PDF's **_net venture capital credits_** for the income year is:

    * where: 

    * **_venture capital credits_** is the total *venture capital credits of the *PDF that relate to tax in relation to taxable income of that income year.

    * **_venture capital debits_** is the total *venture capital debits of the *PDF that relate to tax in relation to taxable income of that income year.

    * CGT limit

    * (3) The *PDF's **_CGT limit _**for the income year is worked out using the formula:

    * where: 

    * **_ordinary capital gains from all SME CGT events_** means the total of the *ordinary capital gains for the income year for *CGT events in relation to *SME investments of the *PDF.

    * **_ordinary capital gains from venture capital CGT events_** means the total of *ordinary capital gains for the income year for *CGT events in relation to shares in companies that are *qualifying SME investments.

    * **_SME tax rate_** is the tax rate applicable to the *SME income component of the *PDF for the income year.

    * Tax paid by the PDF on its SME income component

    * (4) The **_tax paid by the PDF on its SME income component_** for the income year is the tax paid by the *PDF on its *SME income component after allowing *tax offsets referred to in section 410_._

##### _210130  Venture capital surplus and deficit

    * (1) A *PDF's *venture capital subaccount is in **_surplus _**at a particular time if, at that time, the sum of the *venture capital credits in the account exceeds the sum of the *venture capital debits in the account. The amount of the **_venture capital surplus _**is the amount of the excess.

    * (2) A *PDF's *venture capital subaccount is in **_deficit _**at a particular time if, at that time, the sum of the *venture capital debits in the account exceeds the sum of the *venture capital credits in the account. The amount of the **_venture capital deficit _**is the amount of the excess.

    * (3) A *PDF's *venture capital subaccount may be in *deficit even though its *franking account as a whole is in *surplus. Similarly, a PDF's venture capital subaccount may be in surplus even though its franking account as a whole is in deficit.

##### 210135  Venture capital deficit tax

    * (1) While recognising that an entity may anticipate *venture capital credits when *franking *distributions, the object of this section is to prevent those credits from being anticipated indefinitely by requiring the entity to reconcile its *venture capital subaccount at certain times and levying tax if the account is in *deficit.

    * (2) An entity is liable to pay *venture capital deficit tax imposed by the _New Business Tax System (Venture Capital Deficit Tax) Act 2003 _if its *venture capital subaccount is in *deficit at the end of an income year.

    * (3) An entity is liable to pay *venture capital deficit tax imposed by the _New Business Tax System (Venture Capital Deficit Tax) Act 2003 _if:

     * (a) it ceases to be a *PDF; and

     * (b) immediately before it ceases to be a PDF, its *venture capital subaccount is in *deficit.

##### 210140  Effect of a liability to pay venture capital deficit tax on franking deficit tax

    * (1) If an entity is liable to pay *venture capital deficit tax under subsection 210135(2) because its *venture capital subaccount is in *deficit at the end of an income year, the amount (if any) of *franking deficit tax that the entity would otherwise be liable to pay under subsection 20545(2) because its *franking account is in *deficit at that time is reduced by the amount of the liability for venture capital deficit tax.

    * (2) If an entity is liable to pay *venture capital deficit tax under subsection 210135(3) because it ceases to be a *PDF during an income year, the amount (if any) of *franking deficit tax that the entity would otherwise be liable to pay under subsection 20545(3) because it ceases to be a *franking entity at that time is reduced by the amount of the liability for *venture capital deficit tax.

##### 210145  Effect of a liability to pay venture capital deficit tax on the franking account

    * (1) If an entity incurs a liability to pay *venture capital deficit tax, a *franking credit arises for the entity immediately after the liability arises (the **_relevant day_**).

    * (2) The amount of the *franking credit is equal to:

     * (a) if no liability to pay *franking deficit tax arises on the relevant day--the amount of the *venture capital deficit tax; or

     * (b) if a liability to pay franking deficit tax also arises on the relevant day--the amount of the venture capital deficit tax reduced by the amount of the franking deficit tax.

##### 210150  Deferring venture capital deficit

    * (1) The object of this section is to ensure that an entity does not avoid *venture capital deficit tax by deferring the time at which a *venture capital debit occurs.

    * (2) An entity is taken to have *received a refund of income tax for an income year immediately before the end of that year for the purposes of subsection 210135(2) if:

     * (a) the refund is paid within 3 months after the end of that year; and

     * (b) the entity's *venture capital subaccount would have been in *deficit, or in deficit to a greater extent, at the end of the previous income year if the refund had been received in the previous income year.

    * (3) If an entity ceases to be a *PDF during an income year, it is taken to have *received a refund of income tax immediately before it ceased to be a PDF for the purposes of subsection 210135(3) if:

     * (a) the refund is attributable to a period in the year during which the entity was a PDF; and

     * (b) the refund is paid within 3 months after the entity ceases to be a PDF; and

     * (c) the *venture capital subaccount of the entity would have been in *deficit, or in deficit to a greater extent, immediately before it ceased to be a PDF if the refund had been received before it ceased to be a PDF.

##### Subdivision 210H--Effect of receiving a distribution franked with a venture capital credit

##### Guide to Subdivision 210H

##### 210155  What this Subdivision is about

    * A superannuation fund or other entity that deals with superannuation that receives a distribution franked with a venture capital credit is entitled to a tax offset equal to the credit.

##### Table of sections

      * 210175	Amount of the tax offset

      * 210180	Application of Division 207 where the recipient is entitled to a tax offset under section 210170

##### 210160  The significance of a venture capital credit

    * (1) The venture capital credit on a distribution is only significant in the hands of a relevant venture capital investor (basically a superannuation fund or other entity that deals with superannuation).

    * (2) That investor receives a tax offset. In most cases, this will be equal to the venture capital credit.

    * (3) Under section 124ZM of the _Income Tax Assessment Act 1936_, that part of the distribution that is franked with a venture capital credit is also treated as exempt income in the hands of the entity.

##### 210165  Recipients for whom the venture capital credit is not significant

    * (1) For other entities, the fact that all or part of the franking credit on a distribution is also a venture capital credit can be ignored.

    * (2) The franking credit will either generate a grossup of the entity's assessable income and a corresponding tax offset under Division 207 or, if the right to make an election under section 124ZM of the _Income Tax Assessment 1936 _is exercised, the franked part of the distribution will be treated as exempt income.

    * (3) The unfranked part of the distribution is treated as exempt income under section 124ZM of the _Income Tax Assessment Act 1936_.

##### Operative provisions

##### 210170  Tax offset for certain recipients of distributions franked with venture capital credits

    * (1) The recipient of a *distribution *franked with a venture capital credit is entitled to a *tax offset for the income year in which the distribution is made if:

     * (a) the recipient is a relevant venture capital investor; and

     * (b) the recipient is not:

       * (i) a partnership; or

       * (ii) a trustee (other than the trustee of a *complying superannuation fund, a *noncomplying superannuation fund, a *complying approved deposit fund, a *noncomplying approved deposit fund or a *pooled superannuation trust); and

     * (c) the recipient satisfies the *residency requirement for an entity receiving a distribution; and

     * (d) the distribution is not *exempt income of the recipient (ignoring section 124ZM of the _Income Tax Assessment Act 1936_); and

     * (e) the recipient is a qualified person in relation to the distribution for the purposes of Division 1A of former Part IIIAA of the _Income Tax Assessment Act 1936_; and

     * (f) the distribution is not part of a *dividend stripping operation; and

     * (g) the Commissioner has not made a determination under paragraph 20430(3)(c) that no *imputation benefit is to arise for the receiving entity in respect of the distribution; and

     * (h) the Commissioner has not made a determination under paragraph 177EA(5)(b) that no imputation benefit is to arise in respect of the distribution to the recipient.

    * Relevant venture capital investors

    * (2) The following entities are **_relevant venture capital investors_**:

     * (a) the trustee of a fund that is a *complying superannuation fund in relation to the income year in which the *distribution is made and is not a *self managed superannuation fund;

     * (b) the trustee of a fund that is a *complying approved deposit fund in relation to the income year in which the distribution is made and is not a self managed superannuation fund;

     * (c) the trustee of a unit trust that is a *pooled superannuation trust in relation to the income year in which the distribution is made;

     * (d) a *life insurance company.

##### 210175  Amount of the tax offset

    * Where the recipient is not a life insurance company

    * (1) If the entity receiving the *distribution is not a *life insurance company, the *tax offset is equal to the *venture capital credit on the distribution.

    * Where the recipient is a life insurance company

    * (2) If the entity receiving the *distribution is a *life insurance company, the *tax offset is worked out using the formula:

    * where: 

    * **_complying superannuation/FHSA class of taxable income _**means the *complying superannuation/FHSA class of taxable income of the company for the income year in which the *distribution is made.

    * **_tax offset to which the entity would otherwise be entitled _**is the *tax offset that the company would be entitled to under subsection (1) if the entity were not a life insurance company.

    * **_total income_** is the company's assessable income for the income year.

##### 210180  Application of Division 207 where the recipient is entitled to a tax offset under section 210170

    * If the recipient of a *distribution *franked with a venture capital credit is entitled to a *tax offset under section 210170, Division 207 does not apply to that *part of the distribution that is venture capital franked.

##### 2141  Purpose of the system

    * These provisions: 

     * (a) allow the Commissioner to gather sufficient information to determine whether tax is payable by a corporate tax entity under the imputation system; and

     * (b) provide for the Commissioner to assess the amount of tax that is payable; and

     * (c) specify when the tax is payable; and

     * (d) establish systems to support the assessment and collection of the tax.

##### 2145  Key features

    * (1) Initial information about a corporate tax entity's franking activities is provided by means of a return, called a franking return, given by the entity to the Commissioner.

    * (2) The Commissioner is able to require corporate tax entities to give a franking return for an income year by publishing a notice in the _Gazette_.

    * (3) The Commissioner is also able to require a particular corporate tax entity to give a franking return for one or more income years. The Commissioner might do this, for example, if the Commissioner wishes to audit the corporate tax entity's franking activities over a number of years.

    * (4) The Commissioner may assess whether tax is payable under the imputation system and the amount of that tax.

    * (5) In most cases, this is done by treating the first franking return of a corporate tax entity for an income year as an assessment by the Commissioner. To this extent, there is selfassessment.

    * (6) An assessment by the Commissioner is conclusive evidence of a corporate tax entity's tax liabilities under the imputation system, except for the purposes of objection, review and appeal processes under Part IVC of the _Tax Administration Act 1953 _(see section 177 of the _Income Tax Assessment Act 1936_, sections 21450 and 21485 of this Act and section 35010 in Schedule 1 to the _Taxation Administration Act 1953_).

    * (7) Assessments can be amended by the Commissioner within certain time limits.

    * If no franking return is outstanding

    * (1) If:

     * (a) a *corporate tax entity *receives a refund of income tax; and

     * (a) the ADI is an Australian resident; and

     * (b) the nonshare dividend is paid in respect of a *nonshare equity interest that:

       * (i) by itself; or

       * (ii) in combination with one or more *schemes that are *related schemes to the scheme under which the interest arises;

     * forms part of the ADI's Tier 1 capital either on a solo or consolidated basis (within the meaning of the *prudential standards); and

##### 21515  Nonshare dividends are unfrankable if profits are unavailable

    * (1) If:

     * (a) a *corporate tax entity pays a *nonshare dividend; and

     * (b) immediately before the payment, the amount of the *available frankable profits of the entity is nil, or less than nil;

    * the nonshare dividend is **_unfrankable_**.

    * (2) If:

     * (a) a *corporate tax entity pays a *nonshare dividend that is not one of a number of nonshare dividends paid at the same time; and

     * (b) immediately before the payment, the amount of the *available frankable profits of the entity, although greater than nil, are less than the amount of the nonshare dividend;

    * the entity is taken to have made a **_frankable distribution_** equal to the amount of the available frankable profits. The remainder of the dividend is taken to be an **_unfrankable_** distribution.

    * (3) If:

     * (a) a *corporate tax entity pays a *nonshare dividend that is one of a number paid at the same time; and

     * (b) immediately before the payment, the amount of the *available frankable profits of the entity, although greater than nil are less than the sum of the amounts of the nonshare dividends;

    * the entity is taken to have made a **_frankable distribution_** equal to the amount worked out using the formula:

    * The remainder of the dividend is taken to be an **_unfrankable_** distribution.

##### 21520  Working out the available frankable profits

    * (1) Use the following formula to work out the amount of a *corporate tax entity's **_available frankable profits_** at a particular time:

    * where: 

    * **_committed share dividends _**means the sum of:

     * (a) the amounts of any *distributions that are not *nonshare dividends and are paid by the entity at that time; and

     * (b) if the entity has announced that it will pay distributions that are not nonshare dividends at a later time, or is committed or has resolved (formally or informally) to paying such distributions at a later time--the amounts of those distributions.

    * **_maximum frankable amount _**means the maximum amount of *frankable *distributions (other than *nonshare dividends) that the *corporate tax entity could pay at that time having regard to its available profits at that time.

    * **_undebited nonshare dividends _**means the sum of the amounts of the franked parts of the *nonshare dividends (worked out under subsection (2)) that:

     * (a) were not debited to available profits; and

     * (b) were paid within the preceding 2 income years or were paid under the same *scheme under which the entity pays the nonshare dividend.

    * (2) The amount of the **_franked part_** of a *nonshare dividend is worked out using the following formula:

##### 21525  Anticipating available frankable profits

    * (1) A *corporate tax entity that pays a *nonshare dividend may anticipate *available frankable profits if:

     * (a) the entity:

       * (i) has announced the payment of; or

       * (ii) is committed or has resolved (formally or informally) to pay;

     * *distributions other than nonshare dividends (the **_committed distributions_**) after payment of the nonshare dividend; and

     * (b) but for this subsection, section 21515 would apply to the nonshare dividend; and

     * (c) the entity's available frankable profits would be greater than nil at the relevant time if the committed distributions were ignored; and

     * (d) it is reasonable to expect that available profits will arise after payment of the nonshare dividend and before payment of the committed distributions; and

     * (e) it is reasonable to expect that, having regard to the available profits mentioned in paragraph (d), the amount of the entity's *adjusted available frankable profits immediately after each of the committed distributions is paid will be greater than nil.

    * The **_available frankable profits _**immediately before the entity pays the nonshare dividend is then the smallest of the amounts of the adjusted available frankable profits mentioned in paragraph (e).

    * (2) The entity's **_adjusted available frankable profits_** immediately after a committed distribution is paid is the amount that would be its *available frankable profits at that time if all committed distributions to be paid after that time, and the *nonshare dividend, were ignored.

    * (3) A *franking debit arises for the entity if:

     * (a) the entity anticipates*available frankable profits under subsection (1); and

     * (b) the available frankable profits of the entity are less than nil:

       * (i) immediately after the last of the committed distributions is made; or

       * (ii) immediately before the end of the income year following the income year in which the *nonshare dividend is paid;

    * whichever is earlier.

    * (4) The *franking debit is equal to the lesser of:

     * (a) the amount by which the *available frankable profits is below nil; and

     * (b) the amount of the franked part of the *nonshare dividend (worked out using subsection 21520(2)) or, if more than one nonshare dividend is made at the relevant time, the sum of the amounts of the franked parts of those nonshare dividends.

    * (5) In working out the entity's *available frankable profits for the purposes of subsection (3) or (4), disregard:

     * (a) any *distributions that:

       * (i) the entity announces, or becomes committed to or resolves (formally or informally) to pay after the payment of the *nonshare dividend; and

       * (ii) have not been paid; and

     * (b) any estimate made by the entity under subsection (1) after the nonshare dividend is paid.

    * (2) The following table sets out when a *franking credit arises under this section in the *franking account of a *life insurance company.

         * Note 1: On the assessment day, a franking credit that arose under item 1 of the table:

          *  	is reversed by a franking debit that arises under item 1 of the table in section 21930; and

          *  	is replaced with a franking credit that arises under item 2 of the table in this section.

         * Note 2: Section 21950 tells you how to work out the part of an amount that is attributable to the shareholders' share of the income tax liability of the company for the income year.

         * Note 3: To find out whether a tax offset under Division 207 is subject to the refundable tax offset rules: see section 6725.

    * (3) A *franking credit covered by item 6 of the table arises at the end of the income year:

     * (a) that is an income year of the last partnership or trust interposed between:

       * (i) the *life insurance company; and

       * (ii) the *corporate tax entity that made the distribution; and

     * (b) during which the *franked distribution *flows indirectly to the life insurance company.

##### 21930  Franking debits

    * (1) The table in section 20530 (except items 2 and 3) applies to a *life insurance company in the same way as it applies to any other company.

    * (2) The following table sets out when a *franking debit arises under this section in the *franking account of a *life insurance company.

         * Note 1: On the assessment day, a franking debit that arises under item 1 of this table reverses the effect of a franking credit that arose under item 1 of the table in section 21915.

         * Note 2: Section 21950 tells you how to work out the part of an amount that is attributable to the shareholders' share of the income tax liability of the company for the income year.

##### 21940  Residency requirement

    * The tables in sections 21915 and 21930 are relevant for the purposes of subsection 20525(1) (about the residency requirement).

##### 21945  Assessment day

    * A *life insurance company's **_assessment day _**for an income year is the earlier of:

     * (a) the day on which the company furnishes its *income tax return for that income year; or

     * (b) the day on which the Commissioner makes an assessment of the amount of the company's taxable income for that income year under section 166 of the _Income Tax Assessment Act 1936_.

##### 21950  Amount attributable to shareholders' share of income tax liability

    * (1) Subsection (2) applies to a *life insurance company in relation to the payment or refund mentioned in an item of a table in this Subdivision (except item 1 of the table in section 21915).

         * Note: The operation of this section is affected by section 21975 if a tax offset under section 20570 is applied to work out the company's income tax liability.

    * (2) For the purposes of this Part, the part of the payment or refund that is attributable to the *shareholders' share of the income tax liability of the company for an income year must be worked out as follows:

Method statement

       * Step 1.	Work out the part of the company's total income tax liability for the income year that is attributable to the company's shareholders.

       * The result of this step is the **_shareholders' share_** of the income tax liability of the company for the income year.

       * Step 2.	Divide the step 1 result by that total income tax liability.

       * The result of this step is the **_shareholders' ratio _**for the income year.

       * Step 3.	Multiply the amount of the payment or refund by the *shareholders' ratio.

       * The result of this step is the part of the payment or refund that is attributable to the *shareholders' share of the income tax liability of the company for the income year.

    * (3) For the purposes of this Part, the estimate mentioned in item 1 of the table in section 21915 (the part of a payment estimated to be attributable to the *shareholders' share of a company's income tax liability for an income year) must be worked out on the basis of:

     * (a) subject to paragraph (b), the method statement in subsection (2); and

     * (b) the company's reasonable estimate of the amounts that, on the company's *assessment day for the income year, will be:

       * (i) its total income tax liability for the income year; and

       * (ii) the part of that total income tax liability that is attributable to its shareholders.

    * (4) In working out the part of the income tax liability of a *life insurance company that is attributable to the shareholders of the company for the purposes of this section, regard is to be had to the accounting records of the company.

##### 21955  Adjustment resulting from an amended assessment

    * (1) This section applies in relation to the *franking account of a *life insurance company if:

     * (a) the assessment of the company's income tax liability for an income year is amended on a particular day (the **_adjustment day_**); and

     * (b) the *shareholders' ratio (the **_new ratio_**) based on the amended assessment is different from the shareholders' ratio used previously in relation to that income year to work out a *franking credit or *franking debit for the company; and

     * (c) the franking account would have a different balance on the adjustment day if the new ratio had been used to work out all the franking credits and franking debits covered by paragraph (b).

         * Note: The operation of this section is affected by section 21975 if a tax offset under section 20570 is, or has been, applied to work out the company's income tax liability.

    * (2) On the adjustment day, a *franking credit or *franking debit (as appropriate) of the amount worked out under subsection (3) arises in the *franking account.

    * (3) The amount is an adjustment that will bring the *franking account to the balance that it would have on the adjustment day if the new ratio had been used to work out all the *franking credits and *franking debits covered by paragraph (1)(b).

         * Example: On the basis of a shareholders' ratio of 60% for the income year, franking credits of the amounts of $6,000, $6,000, $6,000 and $6,000 arose under item 2 of the table in section 21915 for Company X.

         * An amended assessment results in a new shareholders' ratio of 70%. Under this section, a franking credit of $4,000 arises on the day of the amended assessment to bring the balance of the franking account from $24,000 to $28,000, which would be the account's balance if the new shareholders' ratio had been used.

##### 21970  Tax offset under section 20570

    * (1) For the purposes of paragraph 20570(1)(c), if a *life insurance company was entitled to a *tax offset under section 20570 for a previous income year, assume section 6310 applied to the part of the company's basic income tax liability for that previous income year that was attributable to its shareholders.

    * (2) In working out the part of the company's basic income tax liability that was attributable to its shareholders, have regard to the company's accounting records.

         * Example: The following apply to a life insurance company that satisfies the residency requirement for an income year:

          * (a) the company has a tax offset of $60,000 under section 20570 (the franking deficit offset) for that year;

          * (b) the company's basic income tax liability for that year would be $100,000 if the franking deficit offset were disregarded;

          * (c) 20% of the $100,000 is attributable to the company's shareholders (the shareholders' part).

         * As a result of applying $20,000 of the franking deficit offset to reduce the shareholders' part to nil, the company's basic income tax liability becomes $80,000. The remaining $40,000 of the offset will be included in a franking deficit tax offset for the next income year for which the company satisfies the residency requirement.

##### 21975  Working out franking credits and franking debits where a tax offset under section 20570 is applied

    * Revised shareholders' ratio--modification of section 21950

    * (1) Subsection (2) applies to a *life insurance company if a *tax offset under section 20570 is applied to work out the company's income tax liability for an income year.

         * Note: This means subsection (2) applies if the tax offset is applied to reduce the part of the company's basic income tax liability mentioned in subsection 21970(1) in relation to the income year.

    * (2) For the purposes of working out the amount of a *franking credit or *franking debit for the company in relation to the income year (other than a franking credit covered by item 1 of the table in section 21915), section 21950 has effect as if:

     * (a) steps 1 and 2 of the method statement in section 21950 were omitted; and

     * (b) the reference in step 3 of that method statement to the *shareholders' ratio were a reference to the **_revised shareholders' ratio_** worked out as follows:

Method statement

       * Step 1.	Work out the remainder (if any) of the part of the company's basic income tax liability mentioned in subsection 21970(1) after the *tax offset is applied to reduce that part.

            * Note: The part mentioned in that subsection is the part of an amount of the company's income tax liability for the income year that is attributable to its shareholders.

       * Step 2.	Divide the step 1 result by the company's total income tax liability for the income year (after applying the *tax offset).

       * The result (which can be nil) is the company's **_revised shareholders' ratio _**for the income year.

         * Example: For the 20022003 income year X Co (which is a life insurance company) has a tax offset of $68,000 under section 20570. Its income tax liability for that year would have been $400,000 on the assessment day (1 February 2004) if the tax offset were disregarded. Of that liability, $80,000 is attributable to the shareholders. The step 1 result is therefore $12,000 ($80,000 minus $68,000).

         * X Co's income tax liability after applying the tax offset is $332,000 ($400,000 minus $68,000). The revised shareholders' ratio is therefore 3/83 ($12,000 divided by $332,000).

         * For that income year, the company paid $249,000 of PAYG instalments before the assessment day and $83,000 of income tax one month after that day.

         * On the assessment day, a franking credit of $9,000 arises under item 2 of the table in section 21915 ($249,000 multiplied by 3/83). On the day the additional amount of tax is paid, another franking credit of $3,000 arises under item 4 of that table ($83,000 multiplied by 3/83).

    * Adjustment resulting from amended assessment--modification of section 21955

    * (3) Subsection (4) applies to a *life insurance company if:

     * (a) the assessment of the company's income tax liability for an income year (the **_previous assessment_**) is amended; and

     * (b) at least one of the following applies:

       * (i) a *tax offset under section 20570 is applied in making that amended assessment;

       * (ii) a tax offset under section 20570 was applied in making the previous assessment.

    * (4) Section 21955 has effect in relation to the company as if:

     * (a) if subparagraph (3)(b)(i) of this section applies--a reference in that section to the new ratio were a reference to the revised shareholders' ratio that is based on the amended assessment; and

     * (b) if subparagraph (3)(b)(ii) of this section applies--the reference in paragraph (1)(b) of that section to the *shareholders' ratio used previously were a reference to the revised shareholders' ratio that is based on the previous assessment.

         * Example: Continuing the example in subsection (2), the assessment of X Co for the 20022003 income year is amended on 31 March 2004. Under the amended assessment, X Co's income tax liability would be $300,000 if the tax offset were disregarded.

         * Of that liability, $60,000 is attributable to the shareholders. That amount is reduced by the tax offset of $68,000 to nil.

         * X Co's liability to pay income tax is therefore reduced to $240,000 ($300,000 minus $60,000) and it will receive a refund of $92,000 ($332,000 minus $240,000). As the revised shareholders' ratio has become nil, no franking debit arises from the refund.

         * The franking credits that previously arose from the payments of PAYG instalments and income tax would not have arisen if the new revised shareholders' ratio had been used. Section 21955 (as applied by subsection (4) of this section) therefore operates to create an adjustment to cancel those franking credits. The adjustment is a franking debit of $12,000 that arises on the day of the amendment of the assessment.

    * (2) This section does not limit section 20245 (about *unfrankable distributions).

##### 220110  Maximum franking credit under section 20260

    * For the purposes of working out the *maximum franking credit for a *frankable distribution made by an *NZ franking company in a *foreign currency, translate the amount of the distribution into Australian currency at the exchange rate applicable at the time of the decision to make the *distribution.

##### NZ franking companies' franking accounts etc.

##### 220205  Franking credit for payment of NZ franking company's withholding tax liability

    * (1) A *franking credit arises in the *franking account of a company on the day a payment is made of *withholding tax that the company is liable under section 128B of the _Income Tax Assessment Act 1936_ to pay, if:

     * (a) because of section 22025, the company satisfies the *residency requirement for the income year in which it *derived the income on which it was liable to pay the withholding tax; and

     * (b) the company is a *franking entity for the whole or part of that income year.

    * The amount of the credit equals the amount of the payment.

    * (2) For the purposes of determining whether the company satisfies the *residency requirement for the income year described in paragraph (1)(a), section 20525 has effect as if the derivation of the income described in that paragraph were an event specified in a relevant table for the purposes of that section.

##### 220210  Effect of franked distribution to NZ franking company or flowing indirectly to NZ franking company

    * No tax offset for NZ franking company

    * (1) An *NZ franking company to which a *franked distribution is made or *flows indirectly is not entitled under Division 207 to a *tax offset for the *distribution. That Division has effect subject to this section.

    * Denial of tax offset does not stop franking credit or debit arising

    * (2) However, subsection (1) does not prevent a *franking credit or *franking debit from arising in the *NZ franking company's *franking account under Division 205 or 208. To avoid doubt, the amount of the credit or debit, and the time at which it arises, are the same as they would be apart from subsection (1).

         * Note: This has the effect that the amount and timing of the credit or debit are worked out as if the NZ franking company had been entitled to the tax offset that subsection (1) prevents the company from being entitled to.

##### 220215  Effect on franking account if NZ franking choice ceases to be in force

    * (1) This section has effect if:

     * (a) a company has made an *NZ franking choice; and

     * (b) the choice is revoked or cancelled at a time (the **_end time_**); and

     * (c) immediately before the end time the company is a foreign resident.

    * Franking debit if franking surplus just before end time

    * (2) A *franking debit arises in the company's *franking account on the day during which the end time occurs if the account was in *surplus immediately before that time. The amount of the debit equals the *franking surplus.

    * Franking deficit tax if franking deficit just before end time

    * (3) If the company's *franking account was in *deficit immediately before the end time, subsection 20545(3) applies in relation to the company as if it ceased to be a *franking entity at the end time.

         * Note: Subsection 20545(3) makes an entity liable to pay franking deficit tax if the entity ceases to be a franking entity and had a franking deficit immediately before ceasing to be a franking entity.

    * (4) Subsection (3) does not limit the effect of subsection 20545(3).

    * Take account of franking debit arising under section 220605

    * (5) Take account of any *franking debit arising under section 220605 because of the revocation or cancellation in working out for the purposes of this section whether the company's *franking account is in *surplus or *deficit immediately before the end time.

         * Note: Section 220605 provides for a franking debit to arise in the company's franking account immediately before the end time if, immediately before the end time, the company was a former exempting entity and its exempting account was in deficit.

##### Franking accounts of NZ franking company and some of it00% subsidiaries

##### 220300  NZ franking company's franking account affected by franking accounts of some of it00% subsidiaries

    * (1) This section has effect if all these conditions are met in relation to a company (the **_franking donor company_**) at a time:

     * (a) the franking donor company is at the time:

       * (i) an Australian resident or a *postchoice NZ franking company; and

       * (ii) a *100% subsidiary of a postchoice NZ franking company (the **_parent company_**) that is not a 100% subsidiary of another company that is a member of the same *whollyowned group as the parent company;

     * (b) the franking donor company is at the time a 100% subsidiary of a postchoice NZ franking company (the **_NZ recipient company_**) in relation to which these requirements are met:

       * (i) there must be no companies that are *NZ residents and 100% subsidiaries of the NZ recipient company interposed between it and the franking donor company;

       * (ii) the NZ recipient company must be either the parent company or a 100% subsidiary of the parent company;

     * (c) there are interposed between the NZ recipient company and the franking donor company at the time one or more companies, each of which:

       * (i) is a 100% subsidiary of the NZ recipient company; and

       * (ii) is neither an Australian resident nor an NZ resident.

    * What is a **postchoice NZ franking company**?

    * (2) A company is a **_postchoice NZ franking company_** at a time if:

     * (a) at the time, the company is an *NZ franking company; and

     * (b) the notice constituting the *NZ franking choice that makes the company an NZ franking company at the time was given to the Commissioner at or before the time.

    * Franking donor company's franking surplus when conditions met

    * (3) If the franking donor company's *franking account is in *surplus at the first time all the conditions in subsection (1) are met:

     * (a) a *franking debit equal to the surplus arises in the franking donor company's franking account immediately after that time; and

     * (b) a *franking credit equal to the surplus arises in the NZ recipient company's franking account immediately after that time.

    * Franking donor company's franking deficit when conditions met

    * (4) If the franking donor company's *franking account is in *deficit at the first time all the conditions in subsection (1) are met, subsection 20545(3) applies in relation to the franking donor company as if:

     * (a) it ceased to be a *franking entity at that time; and

     * (b) its franking account had been in deficit to the same extent immediately before that cessation.

         * Note: Subsection 20545(3) makes an entity liable to pay franking deficit tax if the entity ceases to be a franking entity and had a franking deficit immediately before ceasing to be a franking entity.

    * NZ recipient company's franking account after conditions are met

    * (5) If, apart from paragraph (a), a *franking credit or *franking debit would arise in the franking donor company's *franking account at a time (the **_accounting time_**) that is a time when all the conditions in subsection (1) are met but after the first time at which all those conditions are met in relation to the franking donor company:

     * (a) the credit or debit does not arise in the franking donor company's franking account; and

     * (b) a credit or debit of the same amount arises at the accounting time in the NZ recipient company's franking account instead.

    * (6) However, subsection (5) does not apply in relation to:

     * (a) a *franking debit arising in the franking donor company's *franking account under subsection (3); or

     * (b) a *franking credit arising in that account because of item 5 of the table in section 20515 in conjunction with subsection (4) of this section; or

     * (c) a franking debit arising in that account under paragraph 220605(3)(a).

         * Note 1: Item 5 of the table in section 20515 gives rise to a franking credit immediately after a liability to franking deficit tax arises. Subsection (4) of this section causes such a liability to arise under section 20545.

         * Note 2: Paragraph 220605(3)(a) gives rise to a franking debit if the NZ franking choice of a company that is a former exempting entity is revoked or cancelled and the company's exempting account is in deficit immediately before the revocation or cancellation.

    * Franking donor company's benchmark franking percentage

    * (7) Subsection (5) does not affect the franking donor company's *benchmark franking percentage.

    * Special rules if franking donor company is former exempting entity

    * (8) If the franking donor company becomes a *former exempting entity at the first time all the conditions in subsection (1) are met:

     * (a) subsections (3) and (4) do not apply; and

     * (b) subsection (5) does not apply in relation to:

       * (i) a *franking credit arising in the franking donor company's *franking account under item 1 of the table in section 208130 immediately after that time; or

       * (ii) a *franking debit arising in the franking donor company's franking account under item 1 of the table in section 208145 immediately after that time.

         * Note: Subsection (8) ensures that the franking donor company's franking account has a nil balance immediately after the company becomes a former exempting entity and that there is an appropriate balance in the company's exempting account that is not made available for use by the NZ recipient company in franking distributions.

##### Effect of NZ franking company making distribution that is nonassessable and nonexempt

##### 220350  Providing for a franking credit to arise

    * (1) This section has effect if:

     * (a) an *NZ franking company makes a *franked distribution to a company (the **_receiving company_**); and

     * (b) the distribution does not *flow indirectly through the receiving company to another entity; and

     * (c) because of section 7685, or section 23AI or 23AK of the _Income Tax Assessment Act 1936_:

       * (i) all of the distribution is *exempt income, or is *nonassessable nonexempt income, in the hands of the receiving company; or

       * (ii) part of the distribution is exempt income, or is nonassessable nonexempt income, in the hands of the receiving company.

    * (2) A *franking credit arises in the receiving company's *franking account on the day on which the distribution is made.

         * Note: If only part of the distribution is exempt income or nonassessable nonexempt income:

          * (a) a franking credit in relation to the distribution will arise under this section in relation to the part of the distribution that is exempt income, or that is nonassessable nonexempt income; and

          * (b) another franking credit in relation to the distribution will arise under item 3 of the table in subsection 20515(1) in relation to the part of the distribution that is not exempt income, or that is not nonassessable nonexempt income (see also subsection 20790(2)).

    * (3) The amount of the *franking credit that so arises is:

     * (a) if subparagraph (1)(c)(i) applies--the amount of the franking credit on the distribution made by the *NZ franking company; or

     * (b) if subparagraph (1)(c)(ii) applies--so much of the franking credit on the distribution made by the NZ franking company as is attributable to the part of the distribution referred to in that subparagraph.

    * (4) The table in subsection 20515(1) has effect subject to this section.

##### Effects of supplementary dividend from NZ franking company

##### 220400  Grossup and tax offset for distribution from NZ franking company reduced by supplementary dividend

    * (1) This section has effect if:

     * (a) an *NZ franking company:

       * (i) makes a *franked distribution to an entity (the **_recipient_**) in an income year; and

       * (ii) pays a supplementary dividend (as defined in section OB1 of the Income Tax Act 1994 of New Zealand) to the recipient in connection with the franked distribution; and

     * (b) an amount is included in the recipient's assessable income for the income year under section 20720, and the recipient is entitled to a *tax offset for the income year under that section or section 207110; and

    * had been reduced by: 

     * (b) so much of the supplementary dividend as does not exceed that amount of the franking credit.

       * (i) makes a *franked distribution; and

       * (ii) pays a supplementary dividend (as defined in section OB1 of the Income Tax Act 1994 of New Zealand) in connection with the franked distribution; and

     * (d) the recipient is entitled to a tax offset under Division 770 for the income year because of the distribution.

    * (2) If the *franked distribution *flows indirectly to the recipient under subsection 20750(2) or (3), then:

     * (a) the recipient can deduct an amount for the income year that is equal to so much of its share of the supplementary dividend as does not exceed:

       * (i) if the distribution flows indirectly to the recipient under subsection 20750(2)--the recipient's individual interest in relation to the distribution that is mentioned in that subsection; or

       * (ii) if the distribution flows indirectly to the recipient under subsection 20750(3)--the recipient's share amount in relation to the distribution that is mentioned in that subsection; and

     * (b) subsection 20795(5);

     * (c) subsection 207150(1);

    * (5) If subsection 20790(5) or 207150(5) would also apply to the recipient in relation to the *franked distribution, apply that subsection on the basis that:

     * (a) the amount of the recipient's *share of the *franking credit on the distribution;

    * had been reduced by: 

     * (b) so much of the recipient's share of the supplementary dividend as does not exceed the amount of that share of the franking credit.

    * When does a supplementary dividend flow to an entity?

    * (6) A supplementary dividend **_flows indirectly_** to an entity if it would have *flowed indirectly to the entity under subsection 20750(2), (3) or (4), if:

     * (a) the dividend had been a *franked distribution; and

     * (b) a reference in that subsection to the entity's *share of the franked distribution had been a reference to the entity's share of the supplementary dividend.

    * (7) The entity's **_share of the supplementary dividend_** is worked out as follows:

    * (8) Nothing in this section has the effect of including in the entity's assessable income its share of the supplementary dividend.

    * Relationship with Subdivisions 207B, 207D, 207E and 207F

    * (9) Subdivisions 207B, 207D, 207E and 207F have effect subject to this section.

##### 220410  Franking credit reduced if tax offset reduced

    * (1) If, under section 220400 or 220405, a *corporate tax entity's *tax offset (the **_reduced tax offset_**) for the *franked distribution described in that section is less than it would be apart from that section, the *franking credit arising in that entity's *franking account because of the *distribution is equal to the reduced tax offset.

    * (2) The following provisions have effect subject to this section:

     * (a) items 3 and 4 of the table in section 20515;

     * (b) items 5 and 6 of the table in section 21915.

         * Note: Each of those items gives rise to a franking credit for a franked distribution if the recipient is entitled under Division 207 to a tax offset for the distribution. Those items provide that the amount of the credit equals the amount of that offset.

##### Rules about exempting entities

##### 220500  Publicly listed postchoice NZ franking company and its 100% subsidiaries are not exempting entities

    * (1) A *postchoice NZ franking company is not a prescribed person under section 20840 for the purposes of working out whether another *corporate tax entity is an *exempting entity at a particular time because it is effectively owned by prescribed persons within the meaning of section 20825.

    * (2) However, this section does not prevent the company from being taken under section 20845 to be a prescribed person for those purposes.

##### 220510  Parent company's status as prescribed person sets status of all other members of same whollyowned group

    * (1) This section has effect for the purposes of working out whether a company is an *exempting entity at a particular time because it is effectively owned by prescribed persons within the meaning of section 20825, if:

    * Exempting debit if exempting surplus just before end time

    * If exempting deficit just before end time

    * (3) If the company's *exempting account was in *deficit immediately before the end time:

     * (a) a *franking debit equal to that deficit arises in the company's *franking account immediately before the end time; and

##### Tax effect of distribution franked by NZ franking company with an exempting credit

##### 220700  Tax effect of distribution franked by NZ franking company with an exempting credit

    * (1) This section has effect if an *NZ franking company *franks with an exempting credit a *distribution the company makes when it is a *former exempting entity.

    * (2) If, under Subdivision 208H, Division 207 applies in relation to the *distribution, it applies subject to the provisions of this Division that modify the effect of that Division.

         * Note 1: Subdivision 208H provides in some cases for the tax effect of a distribution franked with an exempting credit by applying Division 207 as if the distribution were a franked distribution.

         * Note 2: Sections 220400 and 220405 modify the effect of Division 207 so far as it relates to the tax effect of distributions by NZ franking companies that pay supplementary dividends in connection with the distributions.

##### Joint and several liability for NZ resident company's unmet franking liabilities

##### 220800  Joint and several liability for NZ resident company's franking tax etc.

    * (1) This section has effect if:

     * (a) a company (the **_defaulter_**) became liable under another section to pay an amount described in subsection (2) because the company was an *NZ franking company; and

     * (b) the amount was unpaid by the time (the **_defaulter's due time_**) it was due and payable by the defaulter; and

     * (c) at any time during the period for the amount (see subsection (2)), the defaulter was a member of the same *whollyowned group as one or more other companies (each of which is a **_contributor_**).

    * (2) For the purposes of subsection (1), the amount and period are shown in the table:

    * (3) Just after the defaulter's due time, these companies become jointly and severally liable to pay the unpaid amount:

         * Note 1: Two or more contributors will have different due and payable dates for the same liability if the Commissioner gives them notice of their liability on different days.

         * Note 2: This section does not affect the time at which the liability for the unpaid amount arose for, or became due and payable by, the defaulter.

    * (5) If:

    * the Commissioner is taken to have given the contributor written notice under subsection (4) of the general interest charge for the later day on that later day.

    * (6) Section 254 of the _Income Tax Assessment Act 1936_ applies in relation to the contributors' liability as if it were a liability for tax.
