    * whichever happens sooner.

        * Example: Kate is engaged in foreign service for 20 days, is absent for 2 days and is then engaged in foreign service for 10 days. These 2 periods of foreign service constitute a continuous period of foreign service, because the total period of absence is never more than 1/10 of the total period of foreign service.

        * Kate is then absent for 5 days before commencing a further period of foreign service. No matter how long the further period lasts, it can never constitute a continuous period of foreign service with the first 2 periods of foreign service, because on the fourth day of the second absence the total period of absence i/5 of the total period of foreign service.

     * (b) at the time of making an assessment in respect of income of the person of the year of income, the Commissioner is of the opinion that, at a later time, circumstances will exist because of which those foreign earnings will be exempted from tax by this section;

    * the Commissioner may apply the provisions of this section as if those circumstances existed at the time of making the assessment.

##### Subdivision B--Body ceasing to be an STB

##### 24AW  Body ceasing to be an STB

    * If a body ceases to be an STB in a year of income (the **_cessation year_**), this Act applies to the body as if:

     * (a) the cessation were a change which requires a company to calculate its taxable income and tax loss under Subdivision 165B of the _Income Tax Assessment Act 1997_; and

     * (b) the references in that Subdivision to "company" were references to "body"; and

     * (c) if the body is not a company--there were no further requirement for the body to calculate its taxable income for the year of income under that Subdivision; and

     * (d) the amount of any notional loss of the body calculated under section 16550 of that Act for the period before the cessation were nil; and

     * (e) the body's deductions for tax losses were attributed under section 16555 of that Act to the period before the cessation and not to any other period; and

     * (g) the application of Parts 31 and 33 of the _Income Tax Assessment Act 1997_ were modified, for the purposes of that Subdivision, in accordance with section 24AX of this Act.

##### 24AX  Special provisions relating to capital gains and losses

    * (1) In determining if an amount is to be included in the assessable income of the body under Parts 31 and 33 of the _Income Tax Assessment Act 1997_ for a period that occurred after the cessation, any net capital losses incurred before the cessation are to be disregarded.

    * Special cases where net capital gain before cessation and net capital loss after cessation

    * (2) Subsections (3) and (4) apply if:

     * (a) a net capital gain accrued in the period before the cessation; and

     * (b) if the period from the cessation until the end of the year of income were treated as a year of income--a net capital loss would have accrued in that period.

    * Special case 1--gain exceeds loss

    * (3) If this subsection applies and the net capital gain exceeds the net capital loss:

     * (a) the amount that is to be included in the assessable income of the body for the period that occurred before the cessation as a result of the net capital gain accruing to the body is taken to be the amount by which the net capital gain exceeds the net capital loss; and

     * (b) no net capital gain is taken to have accrued, and no net capital loss is taken to have been incurred, in any period in the cessation year after the cessation; and

     * (c) in determining if a net capital gain accrued to, or a net capital loss was incurred by, the body for the year following the cessation year, no net capital loss is taken to have been incurred by the body in the cessation year.

     * (a) no amount is to be included in the assessable income of the body for any period in the cessation year as a result of a net capital gain accruing to the body; and

     * (b) in determining if a net capital gain accrued to, or a net capital loss was incurred by, the body for the year following the cessation year, the net capital loss that the body incurred in the cessation year is taken to be the amount (if any) by which the net capital loss exceeds the net capital gain.

##### 24AY  Losses from STB years not carried forward

    * (1) If a body is an STB on the last day of a year of income in which it incurs a tax loss, the tax loss is not allowable as a deduction from the body's assessable income of a later year of income unless the body is an STB on the first day of that later year of income.

        * Note: This section prevents losses from years prior to the cessation year from being carried forward to years after the cessation year.

    * (2) This section only applies to a tax loss incurred in the 199596 year of income or a later year of income.

##### 24AYA  Effect of unfunded superannuation liabilities

    * (1) This section applies to a deduction under section 29060 of the _Income Tax Assessment Act 1997_ in respect of a contribution made in relation to a person who was an employee of a prescribed excluded STB when it ceased to be an STB.

    * (2) A deduction to which this section applies is not allowable to the body for any year of income unless the requirements of subsections (3) and (4) are complied with.

    * (3) For the deduction to be allowable, the body must obtain a certificate by an authorised actuary stating the actuarial value, as at the time the body ceases to be an STB, of liabilities of the STB to provide superannuation benefits for, or for SIS dependants of, employees of the body, where the liabilities:

     * (a) accrued after 30 June 1995 and before the time when the body ceased to be an STB; and

     * (b) were, according to actuarial principles, unfunded at that time.

    * (4) The certificate must be in a form approved in writing by the Commissioner. The body must obtain the certificate:

     * (a) before the date of lodgment of its return of income of the year of income in which the body ceased to be an STB; or

     * (b) within such further time as the Commissioner allows.

    * (5) If the body obtains the certificate, a deduction to which this section applies is nevertheless not allowable for a year of income if the sum of all deductions to which this section applies for the year of income is less than or equal to the unfunded liability limit (see subsection (6)) for the year of income.

    * (6) If the sum is greater than that limit, so much of the deduction as is worked out using the following formula is not allowable:

    * where: 

    * **_Unfunded liability limit _**for a year of income is:

     * (a) if the year of income is the one in which the body ceases to be an STB--the actuarial value of the liabilities set out in the actuary's certificate; or

     * (b) in any other case--that actuarial value as reduced by the total amount of deductions to which this section applies that, because of subsection (5), have not been allowable to the body for all previous years of income.

    * (7) Expressions used in this section that are also used in section 29060 of the _Income Tax Assessment Act 1997_ have the same respective meanings as in that section.

    * (3) Where the Commissioner, having regard to any connection between the parties to the transaction by which the taxpayer disposed of the traditional security or by which it was redeemed, or by which the taxpayer acquired the traditional security, is satisfied that the parties were not dealing with each other at arm's length in relation to the transaction, then, for the purposes of determining under subsection (2) the amount of any loss on the disposal or redemption, the consideration for the transaction shall be taken to be:

     * (a) the amount that might reasonably be expected for the transaction if the parties were independent parties dealing at arm's length with each other; or

    * a deduction is not allowable to the taxpayer under this section in respect of so much of the amount of the loss as is a loss of capital or a loss of a capital nature.
