     * (a) to provide integrity for the working out of tax offsets under Division 355 (about R&D) of the _Income Tax Assessment Act 1997_; and

     * (b) to increase certainty through findings about matters relevant to the working out of those tax offsets; and

     * (c) to improve access for small and medium R&D entities to quality research services by maintaining a register of research service providers.

        * Note: The integrity mentioned in paragraph (a) is provided, for example, by:

         * (a) the Board registering entities seeking these tax offsets; and

         * (b) the Board conducting compliance checks on those entities.

##### 26A  Simplified outline

    * The following is a simplified outline of this Part:

     *  	The R&D entity can seek an advance finding to get early notice about whether an activity is considered to be an R&D activity.

     *  	The R&D entity can seek a finding that an activity cannot be conducted in Australia. The finding is needed before expenditure incurred on the activity can count towards an R&D tax offset.

     *  	The Board may register entities as research service providers capable of providing research services to R&D entities.

     *  	Internal and external review can be sought for certain decisions under this Part.

     *  	These findings bind the Commissioner for the purposes of any entitlement of the R&D entity to a tax offset under Division 355 of the _Income Tax Assessment Act 1997_ for the activities.

     *  	The Board will register an R&D entity's activities consistently with any findings made about the entity's application. Any findings made about these activities after registration will, if necessary, automatically vary the entity's registration.

    * is less than the total actual and reasonably anticipated expenditure of any entity in all income years on:
