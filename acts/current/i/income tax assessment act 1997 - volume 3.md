##### Guide to Division 58

##### 581  What this Division is about

    * This Division sets out special rules that apply in calculating deductions for the decline in value of depreciating assets and balancing adjustments for assets previously owned by an exempt entity if the assets: 

      * continue to be owned by that entity after the entity becomes taxable; or

      * are acquired from that entity, in connection with the acquisition of a business, by a purchaser that is a taxable entity.

    * There is a choice of 2 methods for each depreciating asset: 

      * the notional written down value method; and

      * the undeducted preexisting audited book value method.

##### Subdivision 58A--Application

##### Table of sections

       * 585	Application of Division

       * 5810	When an asset is acquired in connection with the acquisition of a business

##### 585  Application of Division

    * (1) This Division applies in 2 situations.

    * Entity sale

    * (2) The first (an **_entity sale situation_**) is where:

      * (a) at a particular time on or after 1 July 2001, an entity is an *exempt entity; and

      * (b) just after that time, the entity's *ordinary income or *statutory income becomes to any extent assessable income.

    * (3) In an entity sale situation:

      * (a) the entity is a **_transition entity_**; and

      * (b) the time when the entity's *ordinary income or *statutory income becomes to that extent assessable is the **_transition time_**; and

      * (c) the income year in which the *transition time occurs is the **_transition year_** for the entity; and

      * (d) the *depreciating assets the *transition entity *held just before the transition time are **_privatised assets_**.

    * Asset sale

    * (4) The second (an **_asset sale situation_**) is where:

      * (a) at a particular time on or after 1 July 2001, an entity (the **_purchaser_**) whose *ordinary income or statutory income is to any extent assessable acquires a *depreciating asset from the Commonwealth, a State, a Territory or an *exempt entity; and

      * (b) the asset is acquired in connection with the acquisition of a *business from the Commonwealth, the State, the Territory or the exempt entity.

    * (5) In an asset sale situation:

      * (a) the Commonwealth, the State, the Territory or the *exempt entity is the **_tax exempt vendor_**; and

      * (b) the time when the *depreciating asset is acquired is the **_acquisition time_**; and

      * (c) the income year in which the *acquisition time occurs is the **_acquisition year_**; and

      * (d) each *depreciating asset the purchaser acquires from the *tax exempt vendor at the acquisition time is a **_privatised asset_**.

##### 5810  When an asset is acquired in connection with the acquisition of a business

    * (1) A *depreciating asset is taken to be acquired in connection with the acquisition of a *business from the Commonwealth, the State, the Territory or the *exempt entity if and only if:

      * (a) the asset was used by the Commonwealth, the State, the Territory or the exempt entity in carrying on a business and the purchaser or another entity uses the asset in carrying on the business; or

      * (b) subsection (2) applies.

    * (2) This subsection applies if:

      * (a) the asset was used by the Commonwealth, the State, the Territory or the *exempt entity in performing functions, or engaging in activities, that did not constitute the carrying on of a *business by the Commonwealth, the State, the Territory or the exempt entity and the asset is used by the purchaser or another entity in performing those functions or engaging in those activities as part of carrying on a business; or

      * (b) all of these subparagraphs apply:

        * (i) the acquisition by the purchaser of the asset was connected with the acquisition of another asset by the purchaser or another entity from the Commonwealth, the State, the Territory or the exempt entity or from an *associate of the Commonwealth, the State, the Territory or the exempt entity;

        * (ii) ownership of the other asset gives the purchaser or other entity a right, or imposes on the purchaser or other entity an obligation, to perform functions or engage in activities as part of the carrying on of a business or confers on the purchaser or other entity a commercial advantage or opportunity in connection with performing functions or engaging in activities as part of the carrying on of a business;

        * (iii) the asset is used by the purchaser or other entity in performing those functions or engaging in those activities under the right or obligation or in taking the benefit of the advantage or opportunity; or

      * (c) the asset was acquired by the purchaser under an *arrangement under which the purchaser or another entity acquired another asset from the Commonwealth, the State, the Territory or the exempt entity or from an associate of the Commonwealth, the State, the Territory or the exempt entity and:

        * (i) the other asset is taken by paragraph (1)(a), or by paragraph (a) or (b) of this subsection; or

        * (ii) where the other asset is not a depreciating asset, it would, if it were a depreciating asset, be taken by paragraph (1)(a), or by paragraph (a) or (b) of this subsection;

      * to be acquired in connection with the acquisition of a business from the Commonwealth, the State, the Territory or the exempt entity.

    * (3) Paragraphs (2)(a), (b) and (c) do not apply if the asset is used by the purchaser solely to *derive assessable income from the provision of office or residential accommodation.

       * 5890	Method and effective life for transition entity

##### 5860  Purpose of rules in this Subdivision

    * This Subdivision sets out rules that affect the way in which the *transition entity or the purchaser work out the decline in value of, and balancing adjustments for, *privatised assets under Division 40 after the *transition time or the *acquisition time.

##### 5865  Choice of method to work out cost of privatised asset

    * (1) The *transition entity or the purchaser has a choice to work out the first element of the *cost of each *privatised asset.

    * (2) The choice is to use either:

      * (a) the *notional written down value of the asset; or

      * (b) the *undeducted preexisting audited book value (if any) of the asset.

    * (3) The choice must be made:

      * (a) for the *transition entity--by the day on which the transition entity lodges its *income tax return for the *transition year; or

      * (b) for the purchaser--by the day on which the purchaser lodges the purchaser's income tax return for the *acquisition year;

    * or within a further period allowed by the Commissioner.

    * (4) The choice, once made, cannot be changed.

##### 5870  Application of Division 40

    * Application of Division 40

    * (1) The *transition entity and the purchaser work out the decline in value of, and the effect of a *balancing adjustment event occurring for, each *privatised asset using Division 40 (Capital allowances) as if the asset had been acquired under a contract entered into on or after 1 July 2001.

    * Entity sale situation

    * (2) Division 40 applies to a *privatised asset *held by the *transition entity as if the asset had not been used, or *installed ready for use, for any purpose before the *transition time.

    * (3) The first element of the *cost to the *transition entity at the *transition time is the *notional written down value of the asset or the *undeducted preexisting audited book value of the asset (depending on the choice made for the asset).

    * (4) No amount incurred before the *transition time is included in the second element of the *cost of a *privatised asset.

    * Asset sale situation

    * (5) The first element of the *cost of a *privatised asset to the purchaser at the *acquisition time is the sum of:

      * (a) the *notional written down value of the asset or the *undeducted preexisting audited book value of the asset (depending on the choice made for the asset); and

      * (b) the amount of any incidental costs to the purchaser in acquiring the asset.

##### 5875  Meaning of notional written down value

    * (1) The **_notional written down value_** of a *privatised asset is its *adjustable value in the hands of:

      * (a) the *transition entity just before the *transition time; or

      * (b) the *tax exempt vendor just before the *acquisition time;

    * worked out using the assumptions in this section.

    * Application of Division 40

    * (2) Assume that Division 40 had always applied to work out the decline in value of the *privatised asset.

    * Use for taxable purposes

    * (3) Assume that, in applying Division 40 to the *privatised asset, it had always been used by the *transition entity or the *tax exempt vendor wholly for *taxable purposes.

    *  Cost and acquisition time: exempt Australian government agency

    * (4) If the *transition entity or the *tax exempt vendor was an *exempt Australian government agency just before the *transition time and had acquired the *privatised asset from another exempt Australian government agency:

      * (a) assume that the transition entity or tax exempt vendor acquired it at the time when it was acquired or constructed by the other exempt Australian government agency and that the first element of its *cost to the transition entity or tax exempt vendor is the amount that was its cost to the other exempt Australian government agency; or

      * (b) if it had, before its acquisition by the transition entity or tax exempt vendor, been successively *held by 2 or more exempt Australian government agencies--assume that:

        * (i) the transition entity or tax exempt vendor acquired it at the time when it was acquired or constructed by the first of those exempt Australian government agencies that owned it; and

        * (ii) the first element of its cost to the transition entity or tax exempt vendor is the sum of the amount that was the first element of its cost to the first of those exempt Australian government agencies that owned it and any amount included in the second element of its cost for that first agency or a later successive agency.

    * Effective life

    * (5) Assume that:

      * (a) the *transition entity or the *tax exempt vendor had chosen to use an *effective life determined by the Commissioner for the *privatised asset as in force at the *transition time or the *acquisition time; and

      * (b) subsection 4095(2) did not apply.

    * (5A) Assume that section 40102 did not apply to a *privatised asset unless all of the following are satisfied:

      * (a) it is an entity sale situation within the meaning of section 585;

      * (b) a *capped life applies to the asset under subsection 40102(4) or (5) at both the asset's *start time and the *transition time;

      * (c) the *transition entity chooses, for the purposes of this section, to have section 40102 apply to the asset.

    * If section 40102 is to be applied to the asset, disregard paragraphs 40102(2)(a) and (b) and assume that the relevant time for the purposes of the application of that section to the asset were the transition time.

    * (6) Assume also that section 40110 (about recalculating effective life) did not apply.

##### 5880  Meaning of undeducted preexisting audited book value

    * (1) The **_undeducted preexisting audited book value_** of a *privatised asset is its *adjustable value in the hands of:

      * (a) the *transition entity just before the *transition time; or

      * (b) the *tax exempt vendor just before the *acquisition time;

    * worked out using the assumptions in this section.

    * Application of Division 40

    * (2) Assume that Division 40 had always applied to work out the decline in value of the *privatised asset.

    * Use for taxable purposes

    * (3) Assume that, in applying Division 40 to the *privatised asset, it had always been used by the *transition entity or the *tax exempt vendor wholly for *taxable purposes.

    * Cost

    * (4) Assume that:

      * (a) the first element of the *privatised asset's *cost to the *transition entity or the *tax exempt vendor is its *preexisting audited book value as at the latest time (the **_test time_**) at which it had a preexisting audited book value; and

      * (b) no amount was included in the second element of the asset's cost before the test time; and

      * (c) any amount included in the second element of the asset's cost after the test time had been incurred by the transition entity or the tax exempt vendor.

    * Acquisition time

    * (5) Assume that the *transition entity or the *tax exempt vendor had acquired the *privatised asset at the test time.

    * Effective life

    * (6) Assume that:

      * (a) the *transition entity or the *tax exempt vendor had chosen to use an *effective life determined by the Commissioner for the *privatised asset as in force at the *transition time or the *acquisition time; and

      * (b) subsection 4095(2) did not apply.

          * Note: Section 40102 does not apply to a privatised asset for the purposes of this section.

    * (7) Assume also that section 40110 (about recalculating effective life) did not apply.

##### 5885  Preexisting audited book value of depreciating asset

    * (1) A *privatised asset has a **_preexisting audited book value_** if:

      * (a) a balance sheet, as at the end of an annual accounting period (the **_balance date_**), that was prepared as part of the final accounts of the Commonwealth, a State, a Territory or an *exempt entity for that period showed the asset as an asset of the relevant entity and specified a value for it; and

      * (b) a qualified independent auditor who was engaged, or was required by law, to undertake an audit of those accounts had prepared and signed, before 4 August 1997, a final audit report on those accounts; and

      * (c) the report did not state that the auditor was not satisfied that the specified value fairly represented the value of the asset.

    * The asset is taken to have had a **_preexisting audited book value_** at the balance date of an amount equal to the specified value.

    * (2) If a balance sheet did not specify a value for the asset but specified a total value for 2 or more assets including the asset, the balance sheet is taken to have specified as the value of the asset so much of that total value as is reasonably attributable to the asset.

##### 5890  Method and effective life for transition entity

    * (1) The *transition entity must, in working out the decline in value of a *privatised asset, use the *diminishing value method or the *prime cost method for the asset that it used to work out the *notional written down value, or the *undeducted preexisting audited book value, of the asset.

    * (2) In working out the decline in value of a *privatised asset held by a *transition entity:

      * (a) if section 40102 applied to the asset for the purposes of subsection 5875(5A)--section 40102 applies to the asset and applies as if the relevant time for the asset for the purposes of that section were the *transition time; or

      * (b) if section 40102 did not apply to the asset for the purposes of subsection 5875(5A) or section 5880--section 40102 does not apply to the asset.

    * Integrity rule

    * (4) Subsection (1) does not apply if, at the time the entity *derives the *SRWUIP payment in respect of a *SRWUIP program, it is reasonable to conclude that:

      * (a) the entity will not incur expenditure at least equal to the payment on works required by the program; and

      * (b) despite not incurring such expenditure, the entity will comply with the program because an *associate of the entity will incur expenditure on those works; and

##### Guide to Subdivision 61I

##### 61350  What this Subdivision is about

    * You are entitled to a tax offset for your first child, for income years up to and including the year the child turns 5, if you meet certain conditions.

    * The amount of the offset is usually based on your tax liability in the year before you became responsible for the child, and on a comparison between your taxable income in that year and the year you are claiming for. However, if you are a low income taxpayer, a minimum offset will generally be available.

    * Instead of claiming the offset yourself, you may transfer your entitlement to your spouse.

    * If you are entitled to a tax offset because you adopt a child, you might also be entitled to an offset if the child was in your care before the adoption.

##### Transferring an entitlement

##### 61385  You may transfer your entitlement to a tax offset

    * (1) If you are entitled to a *tax offset for a child for an income year under section 61355 or 61440, you may transfer that entitlement to another person.

    * (1A) However, if you are entitled to a *tax offset for a child for a particular income year under both of sections 61355 and 61440, you may only transfer one of those entitlements to another person if you also transfer the other entitlement to the same person.

    * (2) A transfer has effect only if:

      * (a) the transferee was your *spouse at all times when you had a *primary entitlement for the child for the income year; and

      * (b) the transferee does not have a primary entitlement for that, or another, child for any time during the income year; and

      * (c) you have not already claimed the *tax offset for the income year; and

##### 61410  Claim is irrevocable

    * A claim for a *tax offset under this Subdivision cannot be revoked.

##### Amount of a first child tax offset

##### 61415  Formula for working out amount of tax offset

    * The amount of your *tax offset under sections 61355 and 61440 for an income year is the amount (rounded up to the nearest whole dollar) worked out using the formula:

    * where: 

    * **_entitlement amount_** has the meaning given by section 61420.

    * **_total of the entitlement days_** has the meaning given by section 61425.

##### 61420  Component of formula--entitlement amount

    * (1) In section 61415, the **_entitlement amount_** is the amount (rounded up to the nearest whole dollar) worked out using the formula:

    * where: 

    * **_base amount_** is the lesser of:

      * (a) onefifth of your basic income tax liability for your *base year (as worked out in step 2 of the method statement in subsection 410(3)); and

      * (b) $2,500.

    * (2) However, if:

      * (a) the current income year is not your *base year; and

      * (b) your taxable income for the current income year is not more than $25,000; and

      * (c) the amount worked out under subsection (1) is less than $500;

    * then the **_entitlement amount_** is $500.

    * (3) If the amount worked out under subsection (1) is negative, then, unless subsection (2) applies, the **_entitlement amount_** is nil.

##### 61425  Component of formula--total of the entitlement days

    * (1) In section 61415, the **_total of the entitlement days_** is the total number of days for which the primary person (see subsection (3)) had a *primary entitlement to a *tax offset under either or both of sections 61355 and 61440 for the child for the income year.

    * (2) In addition, if:

      * (a) the relevant *child event happened in the primary person's *base year; and

      * (b) the primary person did not transfer the entitlement under section 61385 for the primary person's base year; and

      * (c) the relevant child turns 5 during the income year;

    * the **_total of the entitlement days_** also includes the number of days in the base year for which the primary person had a primary entitlement to a *tax offset under either or both of sections 61355 and 61440 for the child.

    * (3) In this section, the **_primary person _**is:

      * (a) if you are claiming the offset as a person who has a *primary entitlement to the offset for the child--you; or

      * (b) if you are claiming the offset as a transferee under section 61400--the transferor.

##### 61430  What is your base year?

    * Primary entitlement

    * (1) Your **_base year_** for an entitlement to a *tax offset for a child under section 61355 is:

      * (a) if you were an Australian resident at any time in the income year just before the income year in which the *child event for the child happened (the **_event year_**)--the income year just before the event year; and

      * (b) otherwise--the event year.

          * Note: If a child is in your care before you adopt the child, your base year can instead be the year the child was first in your care or the year before that (see section 61450).

    * (2) If paragraph (1)(a) applies to you, you may choose the event year to be your base year, in the *approved form. A choice cannot be revoked.

    * (3) A choice cannot be made:

      * (a) after you have claimed the *tax offset under section 61355 for any income year; or

      * (b) after you have transferred your entitlement to the tax offset under section 61355 for any income year.

    * Transferred entitlement

    * (4) Your **_base year _**for an entitlement transferred to you under section 61385 is the income year before the first income year for which the entitlement for the child was transferred to you.

      * (c) you have become legally responsible for the child by adopting the child; and

      * (d) the time is on or after 1 July 2001 and before 1 July 2004.

          * Note: See section 61445 for when a child is first in your care.

    * (1) This section defines your **_base year_** if you are entitled to a *tax offset for a child under section 61440 (which is where a child is in your care before you legally adopt the child).

    * Primary entitlement

    * (2) Your **_base year _**for a *tax offset under sections 61355 and 61440 is:

      * (a) if you were an Australian resident at any time in the income year (the **_previous income year_**) just before the income year in which the child was first in your care--the later of the following years:

        * (i) the previous income year;

        * (ii) the income year commencing on 1 July 2000; and

      * (b) otherwise--the later of the following years:

        * (i) the earliest income year in which you were an Australian resident and the child was in your care;

        * (ii) the income year commencing on 1 July 2001.

          * Note: See section 61445 for when a child is first in your care.

    * A choice cannot be revoked.

    * (4) A choice cannot be made:

      * (b) after you have transferred your entitlement to the tax offset under section 61440 for any income year.

    * Transferred entitlement

    * (5) Your **_base year _**for an entitlement transferred to you under section 61385 is the income year before the first income year for which the entitlement for the child was transferred to you.

##### 61455  Old Subdivision applies if you would be worse off

    * This Subdivision as in force on 30 June 2004 (instead of this Subdivision as amended by Schedule 10 to the _Tax Laws Amendment (2004 Measures No. 6) Act 2005_) continues to apply to you if the amount of all *tax offsets to which you would be entitled under this Subdivision as in force on that date is more than the amount of all tax offsets to which you would be entitled under the amended Subdivision.

          * Note: The effect of this is that:

            * (a) you are only entitled to a tax offset in respect of days for which you are legally responsible for the child (and not days during which the child is in your care); and

            * (b) your base year is the income year in which the child event happened or the year before.

##### Subdivision 61IA--Child care tax offset

##### Operative provisions

##### 61465  Object of this Subdivision

    * The object of this Subdivision is to provide a *tax offset to assist families with the cost of child care.

##### Entitlement to the child care tax offset

##### 61470  Who is entitled to the tax offset

    * (1) You are entitled to a *tax offset for an income year ending before 1 July 2007 (the **_child care offset year_**) for *approved child care provided in the previous income year (the **_child care base year_**) if:

      * (a) you are an individual; and

      * (b) there is at least 1 *child care base week for you and a particular child in the child care base year.

          * Example: If there is at least 1 child care base week for you and a child in the 20042005 income year (the child care base year), you are entitled to a tax offset for the child for the 20052006 income year (the child care offset year).

    * (2) A week is a **_child care base week _**for you and a particular child in the child care base year if:

      * (a) the week starts on a Monday in the child care base year (whether or not it finishes in the child care base year); and

      * (b) you are *entitled to child care benefit for *approved child care provided for the child in the week; and

      * (c) one or more of the following limits applies under Subdivision G of Division 4 of Part 3 of the _A New Tax System (Family Assistance) Act 1999_ to your *entitlement to child care benefit for that week:

        * (i) the 50 hour limit (see section 54 of that Act);

        * (ii) the more than 50 hour limit (see section 55 of that Act);

        * (iii) the 24 hour care limit for a particular session (or sessions) of care (see section 56 of that Act).

          * Note: If one of the paragraph (c) limits applies, you satisfy the paragraph (c) condition even if you have not used approved child care for the child during the week up to the full extent of the limit.

    * (3) If you are *entitled to child care benefit subject to a limit of only 24 hours for a week under subsection 53(3) of the _A New Tax System (Family Assistance) Act 1999_, the condition mentioned in paragraph (2)(c) is not satisfied for the week.

    * (4) The 50 hour limit is taken, for the purposes of paragraph (2)(c), to apply to your entitlement for child care benefit for the week if it would have applied but for the fact that you failed to meet the requirements of paragraph 17A(1)(b) of the _A New Tax System (Family Assistance) Act 1999_ in relation to the week.

##### 61475  Meaning of approved child care

    * (1) **_Approved child care_**, for a particular child, is care provided for the child by a child care service that is approved under section 195 of the _A New Tax System (Family Assistance) (Administration) Act 1999_.

    * (2) **_Approved child care _**is also taken to have been provided by such a child care service for the child during a period of absence from care if section 10 or 10A of the _A New Tax System (Family Assistance) Act 1999_ applies to the period of absence.

          * Note: If a child is absent from care during a period for which child care fees are incurred for the child, but neither of sections 10 or 10A of the _A New Tax System (Family Assistance) Act 1999_ apply to the period of absence, **_approved child care_** would not be taken to have been provided for the child. As a result, child care fees incurred for the child during the period would not count as **_approved child care fees _**for which the child care tax offset is payable (see sections 61485 and 61490).

##### 61480  Meaning of entitled to child care benefit and entitlement to child care benefit

    * (1) You are **_entitled to child care benefit_** for *approved child care for a child as provided in this section, and not otherwise. The amount of your **_entitlement to child care benefit _**for the care is as provided in this section, and not otherwise.

          * Note: Child care benefit is a benefit provided for by the _A New Tax System (Family Assistance) Act 1999._

    * _General rule--actual determination of entitlement must have been made

    * (2) You are only entitled to child care benefit for the care if you are so entitled because of a determination made under section 51B or 52E of the _A New Tax System (Family Assistance) (Administration) Act 1999_. The amount of your entitlement to child care benefit for the care is the amount worked out under that Act by reference to that determination.

    * Entitlement based on fee reductions under a determination of conditional entitlement

    * (3) However, if:

      * (a) a determination (the **_conditional determination_**) has been made under section 50F of the _A New Tax System (Family Assistance) (Administration) Act 1999_ that you are conditionally eligible for child care benefit by fee reduction for the care; and

      * (b) under section 219A of that Act as it applies in relation to the determination, fees for the care have been reduced;

    * you are, subject to subsections (4) and (5), taken to be entitled to child care benefit for the care. The amount of your entitlement to child care benefit for the care is the amount of the reduction.

    * (4) Despite subsection (3), if:

      * (a) a determination (the **_final determination_**) is subsequently made under section 51B of the _A New Tax System (Family Assistance) (Administration) Act 1999_ of your entitlement to be paid child care benefit by fee reduction for the care; and

      * (b) the amount (the **_final determination amount_**) of your entitlement to child care benefit for the care, as worked out by reference to the final determination, differs from the amount of the reduction referred to in paragraph (3)(b);

    * the amount of your entitlement to child care benefit for the care is taken to be, and always to have been, the final determination amount.

    * (5) Despite subsection (3), if a determination is subsequently made under section 51C of the _A New Tax System (Family Assistance) (Administration) Act 1999_ that you are not entitled to be paid child care benefit by fee reduction for the care, you are taken not to be, and never to have been, entitled to be paid any child care benefit for the care.

    * Entitlement does not end with receipt

    * (6) In applying this Act at a particular time in relation to yourself and the care, the fact that you have, by that time, received some or all of your entitlement to child care benefit for the care does not mean that you are no longer to be regarded as being entitled to child care benefit for the care.

    * Later determinations, variations and substitutions to be taken into account

    * (7) If, after applying this Act at a particular time in relation to yourself and the care, a determination mentioned in this section is made or varied, or is set aside and a new determination substituted, the question of your entitlement to child care benefit for the care is to be redetermined taking account of the making, variation or substitution.

##### Amount of the child care tax offset

##### 61485  Amount of the child care tax offset

    * The amount of your *tax offset for a child care offset year is worked out in this way:

Method statement

        * Step 1.	For each child in relation to whom you are entitled to the *tax offset for the child care offset year, work out amounts in accordance with steps 2, 3 and 4.

        * Step 2.	Work out the total amount of your *approved child care fees for the child in each *child care base week for you and the child in the child care base year.

        * Step 3.	Work out the total amount of your *entitlement to child care benefit for *approved child care for the child in each *child care base week for you and the child in the child care base year.

        * Step 4.	Work out the lesser of the following amounts (the **_child offset_**) for the child:

          * (a) the amount worked out using the formula:

          * (b) the *child care offset limit for the child care base year.

        * Step 5.	Total the child offsets for each of those children. The result is the amount of your *tax offset for the child care offset year.

##### 61490  Component of formula--approved child care fees

    * General rule--approved child care fees for a child care base week for you and a child

    * (1) The amount of your **_approved child care fees_** for a child for a *child care base week for you and the child is the amount of fees for *approved child care for the child during the week that are incurred by:

      * (a) you; or

      * (b) your partner, within the meaning of the _A New Tax System (Family Assistance) Act 1999_, during the week.

    * Subject to subsection (2), it does not matter whether you are *entitled to child care benefit for all of that care.

    * Special rule if the week is also a child care base week for your partner and the child

    * (2) If the *child care base week is also a child care base week for your partner and the child, your approved child care fees for the week do not include any fees incurred by your partner for *approved child care, for the child in the week, for which you are not *entitled to child care benefit.

    * If fee reduction applies, count unreduced amount of fees

    * (3) If fees for *approved child care have been reduced under section 219A of the _A New Tax System (Family Assistance) (Administration) Act 1999_, then for this section, a reference to the fees incurred for the care is taken to be a reference to the fees that would have been incurred for the care if they had not been so reduced.

##### 61495  Component of formula--child care offset limit

    * (1) The **_child care offset limit _**for the 20042005 child care base year is $4,000. The limit is indexed annually.

          * Note: Subdivision 960M shows you how to index amounts.

    * (2) In applying the indexation formula in subsection 960275(1) to determine the child care offset limit for the 20052006 child care base year or a later child care base year, the relevant financial year is the child care base year rather than the child care offset year for which the offset is being calculated.

##### Transfer of entitlement to unused balance of child care tax offset

##### 61496  Entitlement to transfer

    * (1) You may transfer your entitlement to so much of your *tax offset as is equal to the excess to the individual who was your *spouse as at the last day of the child care offset year.

          * Note: The excess part of a tax offset is worked out under Division 63.

    * (2) If you make a transfer:

      * (a) the transferee is entitled to the transferred part of the *tax offset for the child care offset year; and

      * (b) you are no longer entitled to the transferred part of the tax offset.

    * (3) A transfer cannot be revoked.

    * (4) If you die during the child care offset year, the reference to your *spouse in subsection (1) is taken to be a reference to your spouse just before your death.

##### 61497  Form of transfer

    * (1) A transfer has effect only if you have applied for it in the *approved form.

    * (2) The *approved form must require the inclusion of:

      * (a) your *tax file number; and

      * (b) the tax file number of the transferee; and

      * (c) the transferee's signed consent to:

        * (i) the transfer; and

        * (ii) the disclosure of his or her tax file number in the form.

    * (3) Subsection (2) does not limit what may be required by the *approved form.

#### Division 63--Common rules for tax offsets

##### Guide to Division 63

##### 631  What this Division is about

    * This Division sets out some rules that are common to all tax offsets.

##### Table of sections

       * 6310	Priority rules

##### 6310  Priority rules

    * (1) If you have one or more *tax offsets for an income year, apply them against your basic income tax liability in the order shown in the table. To the extent that an amount of a tax offset remains, the table tells you what happens to it.

          * Note 1: Section 131 lists tax offsets.

          * Note 2: Former Division 388 was repealed by the _New Business Tax System (Capital Allowances--Transitional and Consequential) Act 2001_.

          * Note 4: The remaining amount of a carry forward tax offset may be reduced by section 6530 or 6535 to take account of net exempt income.

          * Note 5: Tax offsets mentioned in items 5 and 10 are more commonly referred to as the Senior Australians Tax Offset.

          * Note 6: Rules about applying the rebate for certain lowincome taxpayers are set out in subsection 159N(4) of the _Income Tax Assessment Act 1936_.

    * (2) Within each item, apply the tax offsets in the order in which they arose.

          * Note: This would be relevant if you have carry forward tax offsets of the same category for different income years.

#### Division 65--Tax offset carry forward rules

##### Guide to Division 65

##### 6510  What this Division is about

    * This Division sets out the rules about carrying forward excess tax offsets to later income years.

    * You can only carry forward certain tax offsets.

    * Before you can apply a tax offset to reduce the amount of income tax that you will pay in a later year, you must apply it to reduce certain amounts of net exempt income.

    * The same rules that prevent companies from utilising certain losses of earlier income years prevent companies from applying tax offsets that they have carried forward.

##### Table of sections

  * Operative provisions

       * 6530	Amount carried forward

       * 6535	How to apply carried forward tax offsets

       * 6540	When a company cannot apply a tax offset

       * 6550	Effect of bankruptcy

       * 6555	Deduction for amounts paid for debts incurred before bankruptcy

##### Operative provisions

##### 6530  Amount carried forward

    * (1) The amount of the *tax offset that is carried forward is the amount of the excess worked out under Division 63.

    * (2) However, reduce the *tax offset by the amount worked out by multiplying your *net exempt income by:

      * (a) if you are a *small business entity for the income year--0.285; or

      * (b) otherwise--0.3;

    * if you have a taxable income for the income year.

##### 6535  How to apply carried forward tax offsets

    * (1) A *tax offset that you have carried forward decreases the amount of income tax that you would otherwise have to pay under section 410 in a later income year.

    * (2) You apply a *tax offset that is carried forward to a later year in accordance with the priorities set out in Division 63 as if it were a tax offset for that later year.

    * (3) Before you apply a *tax offset to reduce the amount of income tax that you pay in a later income year in which you have a taxable income, you must apply it to reduce to nil any *net exempt income for:

      * (a) that later income year; or

      * (b) any income year after the year in which the tax offset arose and before the later income year in which you had a taxable income but did not apply the tax offset to reduce the amount of income tax you had to pay.

          * Note: Paragraph (b) would apply to cases such as where your taxable income was below your taxfree threshold or where you had other tax offsets that reduced your income tax to nil.

    * (3A) In reducing *net exempt income for an income year under subsection (3):

      * (a) if you were a *small business entity for the year--each 28.5 cents of *tax offset reduces the net exempt income by $1; or

      * (b) otherwise--each 30 cents of tax offset reduces the net exempt income by $1.

    * (4) You can only apply a *tax offset that you have carried forward to the extent that it has not already been applied.

          * Note: Section 6540 contains special restrictions on applying carried forward tax offsets.

##### 6540  When a company cannot apply a tax offset

    * (1) In working out its *tax offset for the *current year, a company cannot apply a *tax offset it has carried forward if, assuming:

      * (a) the tax offset were a *tax loss of the company for the income year in which it became entitled to the tax offset; and

      * (b) section 16520 (deducting part of a tax loss) were disregarded;

    * Subdivision 165A would prevent the company from deducting it for the current year.

          * Note: Subdivision 165A deals with the deductibility of a company's tax loss for an earlier income year if there has been a change in the ownership or control of the company in the loss year or the income year.

    * (2) If subsection (1) prevents the company from applying the *tax offset, it can apply the _part_ of the tax offset that it is reasonable to consider relates to a _part_ of the income year in which it became entitled to the tax offset, but only if, assuming that part of that income year had been treated as the whole of it, the company would have been entitled to apply the tax offset.

##### 6550  Effect of bankruptcy

    * (1) If during the *current year:

      * (a) you became bankrupt; or

      * (b) you were released from debts under a law relating to bankruptcy;

    * you cannot apply a *tax offset that you have carried forward from an earlier income year in working out the tax offset for the current year or a later income year.

    * (2) Subsection (1) applies even though your bankruptcy is annulled if:

      * (a) the annulment happens under section 74 of the _Bankruptcy Act 1966_ because your creditors have accepted your proposal for a composition or scheme of arrangement; and

      * (b) under the composition or scheme of arrangement concerned, you were, will be or may be released from debts from which you would have been released if instead you had been discharged from the bankruptcy.

##### 6555  Deduction for amounts paid for debts incurred before bankruptcy

    * (1) If:

      * (a) you pay an amount in the *current year for a debt that you incurred in an earlier income year; and

      * (b) you have a *tax offset referred to in section 6550 for that earlier income year;

    * you can deduct the amount paid, but only to the extent that it does not exceed so much of the debt as the Commissioner is satisfied was taken into account in calculating the amount of the tax offset.

    * (2) The total of the following amounts cannot exceed the total of the expenditure that the Commissioner is satisfied was taken into account in calculating the amount of the *tax offset that you are unable to apply because of section 6650:

      * (a) your deductions under subsection (1) for amounts paid in the *current year or an earlier income year for debts incurred in the income year for which you have the tax offset; and

      * (b) the expenditure that the Commissioner is satisfied was taken into account in calculating any amounts of the tax offset that, apart from section 6550, would have been applied in reducing your *net exempt income for the current year or earlier income years.

#### Division 67--Refundable tax offset rules

##### Guide to Division 67

##### 6710  What this Division is about

       * 705	The 3 key features of tax accounting for trading stock

##### 705  The 3 key features of tax accounting for trading stock

    * The purpose of income tax accounting for trading stock is to produce an overall result that (apart from concessions) properly reflects your activities with your trading stock during the income year.

    * There are 3 key features: 

      * (1) You bring your gross outgoings and earnings to account, not your net profits and losses on disposal of trading stock.

      * (2) Those outgoings and earnings are on revenue account, not capital account. As a result:

        * (a) the gross outgoings are usually deductible as general deductions under section 81 (when the trading stock becomes trading stock on hand); and

        * (b) the gross earnings are usually assessable as ordinary income under section 65 (when the trading stock stops being trading stock on hand).

      * (3) You must bring to account any difference between the value of your trading stock on hand at the start and at the end of the income year. This is done in such a way that, in effect:

        * (a) you account for the value of your trading stock as assessable income; and

        * (b) you carry that value over as a corresponding deduction for the next income year.

          * Note: You may not have to bring to account that difference if you are a small business entity: see Division 328.

    * (2) If the item becomes part of your *trading stock on hand before or during the income year in which you incur the outgoing, deduct it in that income year.

    * (3) Otherwise, deduct the outgoing in the first income year:

      * (a) during which the item becomes part of your *trading stock on hand; or

      * (b) for which an amount is included in your assessable income in connection with the disposal of that item.

          * Note	You can deduct your capital costs of acquiring land carrying trees or of acquiring a right to fell trees, to the extent that the trees are felled for sale, or for use in manufacture, by you. (This is because the trees will then usually become your trading stock.) See section 70120.

##### 7020  Nonarm's length transactions

    * If: 

      * (a) you incur an outgoing that is directly attributable to your buying or obtaining delivery of an item of your *trading stock; and

      * (b) you and the seller of the item did not deal with each other at *arm's length; and

      * (c) the amount of the outgoing is greater than the *market value of what the outgoing is for;

    * the amount of the outgoing is instead taken to be that market value. This has effect for the purposes of applying this Act to you and also to the seller.

          * Note: This section also affects the value of the item of trading stock at the end of an income year if you value it at its cost under section 7045 (Value of trading stock at end of income year).

##### 7025  Cost of trading stock is not a capital outgoing

    * An outgoing you incur in connection with acquiring an item of *trading stock is not an outgoing of capital or of a capital nature.

          * Note: This means that paragraph 81(2)(a) does not prevent the outgoing from being a general deduction under section 81.

##### 7030  Starting to hold as trading stock an item you already own

    * (1) If you start holding as *trading stock an item you already own, but do not hold as trading stock, you are treated as if:.

      * (a) just before it became trading stock, you had sold the item to someone else (at *arm's length) for whichever of these amounts you elect:

       *  	its cost (as worked out under subsection (3) or (4));

       *  	its *market value just before it became trading stock; and

      * (b) you had immediately bought it back for the same amount.

          * Example: You start holding a depreciating asset as part of your trading stock. You are treated as having sold it just before that time, and immediately bought it back, for its cost or market value, whichever you elect. (Subdivision 40D provides for the consequences of selling depreciating assets.)

          * The same amount is normally a general deduction under section 81 as an outgoing in connection with acquiring trading stock. The amount is also taken into account in working out the item's cost for the purposes of section 7045 (about valuing trading stock at the end of the income year).

          * Note: Depending on how you elect under paragraph (1)(a), the sale may or may not give rise to a capital gain or a capital loss for the purposes of Parts 31 and 33 (about CGT). It does not if you elect to be treated as having sold the item for what would have been its cost: see subsection 11825(2). However, it can if you elect market value.

    * When you must make the election

    * (2) You must make the election by the time you lodge your *income tax return for the income year in which you start holding the item as *trading stock. (If you do not make the election by then because you do not realise until later that you started to hold the item as trading stock, you must make the election as soon as is reasonable after realising that.) 

    * However, the Commissioner can allow you to make it later (in either case).

    * How to work out the item's cost

    * (3) The item's cost is what would have been its cost for the purposes of section 7045 (about valuing trading stock at the end of the income year) if it had been your *trading stock ever since you last acquired it. In working that out, disregard section 7055 (about acquiring live stock by natural increase).

    * (4) However, if you last acquired the item for no consideration, its cost is worked out using this table:

    * Exceptions

    * (5) Subsection (1) does not apply if you start holding any of the following as *trading stock because they are severed from land: 

      * (a) standing or growing crops; 

      * (b) cropstools; 

      * (c) trees planted and tended for sale.

    * (This does not prevent subsection (1) from applying to a severed item that you later start holding as trading stock.)

    * (6) Subsection (1) does not apply if:

      * (a) you start holding an item as *trading stock; and

      * (b) immediately before you started holding the item as trading stock, you *held the item as a *registered emissions unit.

          * Note: A transaction that this section treats as having occurred is disregarded for the purposes of these provisions of the _Income Tax Assessment Act 1936_:

            *  	subsection 47A(10) (which treats certain benefits as dividends paid by a CFC)

            *  	paragraph 103A(3A)(c) (which affects whether a company is a public company for an income year).

##### Subdivision 70C--Accounting for trading stock you hold at the start or end of the income year

##### Table of sections

  * General rules

       * 7035	You include the value of your trading stock in working out your assessable income and deductions

       * 7040	Value of trading stock at start of income year

       * 7045	Value of trading stock at end of income year

  * Special valuation rules

       * 7050	Valuation if trading stock obsolete etc.

       * 7055	Working out the cost of natural increase of live stock

       * 7060	Valuation of horse breeding stock

       * 7065	Working out the horse opening value and the horse reduction amount

##### General rules

##### 7035  You include the value of your trading stock in working out your assessable income and deductions

    * (1) If you carry on a *business, you compare:

      * (a) the *value of all your *trading stock on hand at the start of the income year; and

      * (b) the *value of all your trading stock on hand at the end of the income year.

          * Note: You may not need to do this stocktaking if you are a small business entity: see Division 328.

    * (2) Your assessable income includes any excess of the *value at the _end_ of the income year over the value at the _start_ of the income year.

    * (3) On the other hand, you can deduct any excess of the *value at the _start_ of the income year over the value at the _end_ of the income year.

##### 7040  Value of trading stock at start of income year

    * (1) The **_value_** of an item of *trading stock on hand at the start of an income year is the same amount at which it was taken into account under this Division or Subdivision 328E (about trading stock for small business entities) at the end of the last income year.

    * (2) The **_value_** of the item is a nil amount if the item was not taken into account under this Division or Subdivision 328E (about trading stock for small business entities) at the end of the last income year.

##### 7045  Value of trading stock at end of income year

    * (1) You must elect to **_value_** each item of *trading stock on hand at the end of an income year at:

      * (a) its *cost; or

      * (b) its market selling value; or

      * (c) its replacement value.

          * Note: An item's market selling value at a particular time may not be the same as its market value.

    * (1A) In working out the *cost, market selling value or replacement value of an item of *trading stock (other than an item the *supply of which cannot be a *taxable supply) at the end of an income year, disregard an amount equal to the amount of the *input tax credit (if any) to which you would be entitled if:

        * (a) you had *acquired the item at that time; and

        * (b) the acquisition had been solely for a *creditable purpose; and

          * Note: Some assets, such as shares, cannot be the subject of a taxable supply.

    * (2) The rest of this Subdivision deals with cases where the normal operation of this section is modified, or where a different valuation method may or must be used. The table sets out other cases where that happens because of provisions outside this Subdivision.

##### Special valuation rules

##### 7050  Valuation if trading stock obsolete etc.

    * You may elect to **_value_** an item of your *trading stock below all the values in section 7045 if:

      * (a) that is warranted because of obsolescence or any other special circumstances relating to that item; and

      * (b) the value you elect is reasonable.

##### 7055  Working out the cost of natural increase of live stock

    * (1) The **_cost_** of an animal you hold as *live stock that you acquired by natural increase is whichever of these you elect:

      * (a) the actual cost of the animal;

      * (b) the cost prescribed by the regulations for each animal in the applicable class of live stock.

    * (2) However, if you incur a service fee for insemination and, as a result, acquire a horse by natural increase, its **_cost_** is the greater of:

      * (a) the amount worked out under subsection (1); and

      * (b) the part of the service fee that is attributable to your acquiring the horse.

    * (3) An election under this section must be made by the time you lodge your *income tax return for the income year in which you acquired the animal. However, the Commissioner can allow you to make it later.

##### 7060  Valuation of horse breeding stock

    * (1) For a horse at least 3 years old that you acquired under a contract and hold for breeding, you can elect a **_value_** other than the values in section 7045.

    * **	**(2)	The **_value_** you can elect for the horse at the end of the income year is worked out using the table:

    * (3) However, if the value worked out under subsection (2) would be less than $1, you must elect the **_value_** of $1.

    * (4) A horse's age is to be measured in whole years as at the end of the relevant income year. The age of a horse not born on 1 August is determined as if the horse had been born on the last 1 August before it was actually born.

##### 7065  Working out the horse opening value and the horse reduction amount

    * (1) The **_horse opening value_** is:

      * (a) if the horse has been your *live stock ever since the start of the income year--its *value as *trading stock at the start of the income year; or

      * (b) otherwise--the horse's base amount (see subsection (3)).

    * (2) The **_horse reduction amount _**is worked out as follows:

      * (a) for female horses under 12 years of age:

      * (b) for any male horse:

    * (3) In this section:

    * **_base amount_** is the lesser of:

      * (a) the horse's *cost; and 

      * (b) the horse's *adjustable value when it most recently became your *live stock. 

    * **_breeding days _**is the number of whole days in the income year since you most recently began to hold the horse for breeding.

    * **_nominated percentage _**is any percentage, up to 25%, you nominate when you make the election in section 7060.

    * **_reduction factor_** is the greater of:

      * (a) 3; and

      * (b) the difference between 12 and the horse's age when you most recently began to hold it for breeding.

##### Subdivision 70D--Assessable income arising from disposals of trading stock and certain other assets

##### Guide to Subdivision 70D

##### 7075  What this Subdivision is about

    * Your assessable income includes the market value of an item of trading stock if you dispose of it outside the ordinary course of business or it ceases to be trading stock in certain other circumstances.

    * This Subdivision treats certain other assets in the same way as trading stock.

##### Table of sections

       * 7080	Why the rules in this Subdivision are necessary

  * Operative provisions

       * 7085	Application of this Subdivision to certain other assets

       * 7090	Assessable income on disposal of trading stock outside the ordinary course of business

       * 7095	Purchase price is taken to be market value

       * 70100	Notional disposal when you stop holding an item as trading stock 

       * 70105	Death of owner

       * 70110	You stop holding an item as trading stock but still own it

       * 70115	Compensation for lost trading stock

##### 7080  Why the rules in this Subdivision are necessary

    * (1) When you dispose of an item of your trading stock in the ordinary course of business, what you get for it is included in your assessable income (under section 65) as ordinary income.

          * Note: An incorporated body is treated as disposing of an item of its trading stock in the ordinary course of business if the body ceases to exist and disposes of the asset to a company that has not significantly different ownership: see Division 620.

    * (2) If an item stops being your trading stock for certain other reasons, an amount is generally included in your assessable income to balance the reduction in trading stock on hand, which is a transaction on revenue account.

    * (3) The other reasons for an item to stop being your trading stock are:

      * (a) you dispose of it outside the ordinary course of business; or

      * (b) interests in it change; or

      * (c) you die; or

      * (d) you stop holding it as trading stock.

##### Operative provisions

##### 7085  Application of this Subdivision to certain other assets

    * This Subdivision (except section 70115) applies to certain assets of a *business as if they were *trading stock on hand of the entity that carries on that business. The assets are:

      * (a) standing or growing crops; and

      * (b) cropstools; and

      * (c) trees planted and tended for sale.

          * Note: Section 70115 assesses insurance or indemnity amounts for lost trading stock.

##### 7090  Assessable income on disposal of trading stock outside the ordinary course of business

    * (1) If you dispose of an item of your *trading stock outside the ordinary course of a *business:

      * (a) that you are carrying on; and

      * (b) of which the item is an asset;

    * your assessable income includes the *market value of the item on the day of the disposal.

    * (1A) If the disposal is the giving of a gift of property by you for which a valuation under section 30212 is obtained, you may choose that the *market value is replaced with the value of the property as determined under the valuation. You can only make this choice if the valuation was made no more than 90 days before or after the disposal.

    * (2) Any amount that you actually receive for the disposal is not included in your assessable income (nor is it *exempt income).

          * Note 1: In the case of an asset covered by section 7085 (which applies this Subdivision to certain other assets), the disposal will usually involve disposing of the land of which the asset forms part.

          * Note 2: For certain disposals of live stock by primary producers, special rules apply: see Subdivision 385E.

          * Note 3: If the disposal is by way of gift, you may be able to deduct the gift: see Division 30 (Gifts).

          * Note 4: If the disposal is of trees, you can deduct the relevant portion of your capital costs of acquiring the land carrying the trees or of acquiring a right to fell the trees: see section 70120.

          * Note 5: This section and section 7095 also apply to disposals of certain items on hand at the end of 199697 that are not trading stock but were trading stock as defined in the _Income Tax Assessment Act 1936_: see section 7010 of the _Income Tax (Transitional Provisions) Act 1997_. 

##### 7095  Purchase price is taken to be market value

    * If an entity disposes of an item of the entity's *trading stock outside the ordinary course of *business, the entity acquiring the item is treated as having bought it for the amount included in the disposing entity's assessable income under section 7090.

##### 70100  Notional disposal when you stop holding an item as trading stock

    * (1) An item of *trading stock is treated as having been disposed of outside the ordinary course of *business if it stops being trading stock on hand of an entity (the **_transferor_**) and, immediately afterwards:

      * (a) the transferor is not the item's sole owner; but

      * (b) an entity that owned the item (alone or with others) immediately beforehand still has an interest in the item.

          * Example: A grocer decides to take her daughters into partnership with her. Her trading stock becomes part of the partnership assets, owned by the partners equally. As a result, it becomes trading stock on hand of the partnership instead of the grocer. This section treats the grocer as having disposed of the trading stock to the partnership outside the ordinary course of her business.

          * Note: If the transferor _is_ the item's sole owner after it stops being trading stock on hand of the transferor, section 70110 applies instead of this section.

    * (2) As a result, the transferor's assessable income includes the *market value of the item on the day it stops being *trading stock on hand of the transferor.

    * (3) The entity or entities (the **_transferee_**) that own the item immediately _after_ it stops being *trading stock on hand of the transferor are treated as having bought the item for the same value on that day.

    * Election to treat item as disposed of at closing value

    * (4) However, an election can be made to treat the item as having been disposed of for what would have been its *value as *trading stock of the _transferor_ on hand at the end of an income year ending on that day.

    * (5) If this election is made, this *value is included in the transferor's assessable income for the income year that includes that day. The transferee is treated as having bought the item for the same value on that day.

    * (6) This election can only be made if:

      * (a) immediately _after_ the item stops being *trading stock on hand of the transferor, it is an asset of a *business carried on by the transferee; and

      * (b) immediately _after_ the item stops being trading stock on hand of the transferor, the entities that owned it immediately beforehand have (between them) interests in the item whose total value is at least 25% of the item's *market value on that day; and

      * (c) the *value elected is _less than_ that market value; and

      * (d) the item is not a thing in action.

    * (7) Also, the election can only be made before 1 September following the end of the *financial year in which the item stops being *trading stock on hand of the transferor. However, the Commissioner can allow the election to be made later.

    * (8) An election must be in writing and signed by or on behalf of each of:

      * (a) the entities that own the item immediately before it stops being *trading stock on hand of the transferor; and

      * (b) the entities that own it immediately afterwards.

    * (9) If a person whose signature is required for the election has died, the *legal personal representative of that person's estate may sign instead.

    * When election has no effect

    * (10) An election has no effect if:

      * (a) the item stops being *trading stock on hand of the transferor outside the course of ordinary family or commercial dealing; and

      * (b) the *consideration receivable by the transferor (or by any of the entities constituting the transferor) substantially exceeds what would reasonably be expected to be the consideration receivable by the entity concerned if the *market value of the item immediately before it stops being trading stock on hand of the transferor were the *value elected under subsection (4).

          * Note: Section 960255 may be relevant to determining family relationships for the purposes of paragraph (10)(a).

    * (11) **_Consideration receivable_** by an entity means so much of the value of any benefit as it is reasonable to expect that the entity will obtain in connection with the item ceasing to be *trading stock on hand of the transferor.

##### 70105  Death of owner 

    * (1) When you die, your assessable income up to the time of your death includes the *market value at that time of the *trading stock of your *business (if any).

          * Note: In the case of trees, you can deduct the relevant portion of your capital costs of acquiring the land carrying the trees or of acquiring a right to fell the trees: see section 70120.

    * (2) The entity on which the *trading stock devolves is treated as having bought it for its *market value at that time.

    * (3) However, your *legal personal representative can elect to have included in your assessable income (instead of the *market value) the amount that would have been the *value of the *trading stock at the end of an income year ending on the day of your death.

    * (4) In the case of an asset covered by section 7085 (which applies this Subdivision to certain other assets), your *legal personal representative can elect to have a nil amount included in your assessable income (instead of the *market value).

    * (5) Your *legal personal representative can make an election only if:

      * (a) the *business is carried on after your death; and

      * (b) the *trading stock continues to be held as trading stock of that business, or the asset continues to be held as an asset of that business, as appropriate.

    * (6) If an election is made, the entity on which the *trading stock devolves is treated as having bought it for the amount referred to in subsection (3) or (4).

    * (7) An election can only be made on or before the day when your *legal personal representative lodges your *income tax return for the period up to your death. However, the Commissioner can allow it to be made later.

##### 70110  You stop holding an item as trading stock but still own it

    * (1) If you stop holding an item as *trading stock, but still own it, you are treated as if:

      * (a) just before it stopped being trading stock, you had sold it to someone else (at *arm's length and in the ordinary course of business) for its *cost; and

      * (b) you had immediately bought it back for the same amount.

          * Example 1: You are a sheep grazier and take a sheep from your stock to slaughter for personal consumption. You are treated as having sold it for its cost. This amount is assessable income, just like the proceeds of sale of any of your trading stock.

          * Although you are also treated as having bought the sheep for the same amount, it would not be deductible because the sheep is for personal consumption.

          * Example 2: You stop holding an item as trading stock and begin to use it as a depreciating asset for the purpose of producing your assessable income. You are treated as having sold it for its cost. This amount is assessable income, just like the proceeds of sale of any of your trading stock.

          * You are also treated as having bought the item for the same amount, which is relevant to working out the item's cost for capital allowance purposes (see Subdivision 40C) and the item's cost base for CGT purposes (see Division 110).

    * (2) This section does not apply if:

      * (a) you stop holding an item as *trading stock; and

      * (b) immediately after you stopped holding the item as trading stock, you start to *hold the item as a *registered emissions unit.

          * Note: A transaction that this section treats as having occurred is disregarded for the purposes of these provisions of the _Income Tax Assessment Act 1936_:

            *  	subsection 47A(10) (which treats certain benefits as dividends paid by a CFC)

            *  	paragraph 103A(3A)(c) (which affects whether a company is a public company for an income year).

##### 70115  Compensation for lost trading stock

    * Your assessable income includes an amount that: 

      * (a) you receive by way of insurance or indemnity for a loss of *trading stock; and

      * (b) is not assessable as *ordinary income under section 65.

##### Subdivision 70E--Miscellaneous

##### Table of sections

       * 70120	Deducting capital costs of acquiring trees

##### 70120  Deducting capital costs of acquiring trees

    * (1) This section gives you deductions for your capital costs of acquiring land carrying trees or of acquiring a right to fell trees.

          * Note: This section is included in this Division because:

            *  	trees felled for sale, or for use in manufacture, by you will usually become your trading stock; and

            *  	before they are felled, the trees are covered by sections 7090 and 70105 because of section 7085. 

    * Land carrying trees

    * (2) You can deduct the amount you paid to acquire land carrying trees if:

      * (a) some or all of the trees are felled during the income year for sale, or for use in manufacture, by you for the *purpose of producing assessable income; or

      * (b) some or all of the trees are felled during the income year under a right you granted to another entity in consideration of payments as or by way of *royalty; or

      * (c) the *market value of some or all of the trees is included in your assessable income for the income year by section 7090 (because you disposed of the trees outside the ordinary course of *business) or section 70105 (because of your death).

    * (It does not matter when you acquired the land.)

          * Note: The market value of trees is _not _included in your assessable income for the income year by section 70105 (because of your death) if your legal personal representative elects under subsection 70105(4) to have a nil amount included instead.

    * Right to fell trees

    * (3) You can deduct the amount you paid to acquire a right to fell trees if:

      * (a) some or all of the trees are felled during the income year for sale, or for use in manufacture, by you for the *purpose of producing assessable income; or

      * (b) some or all of the trees are felled during the income year under a right you granted to another entity in consideration of payments as or by way of *royalty.

    * (It does not matter when you acquired the right.)

    * How much you can deduct for costs of acquiring land or right

    * (4) You can deduct for the income year so much of the amount you paid as is attributable to the trees covered by a paragraph of subsection (2) or (3).

    * (5) If you can deduct an amount because of paragraph (2)(c), you can also deduct for the income year so much of any other capital expenditure you incurred as is attributable to acquiring the trees covered by that paragraph (except so far as you have deducted it, or can deduct it, for any income year under a provision of this Act outside this section).

    * No deduction for carbon sink forests

    * (5A) You cannot deduct under this section so much of an amount you paid or incurred as is attributable to the establishment of trees for which any entity has deducted, or can deduct, an amount for any income year under Subdivision 40J.

    * Nonarm's length transactions

    * (6) If:

      * (a) you can deduct an amount under this section for expenditure incurred in connection with a transaction; and

      * (b) the parties to the transaction did not deal with each other at *arm's length; and

      * (c) the amount of the expenditure is greater than the *market value of what the expenditure is for;

    * the amount of the expenditure is instead taken to be that market value. This has effect for the purposes of working out what you can deduct under this section.

      * (b) otherwise--30%.

          * Note: The remainder of the taxable component is taxed at the top marginal rate in accordance with the _Income Tax Rates Act 1986_.

    * (4) The amount is so much of the *taxable component of the payment as does not exceed the smallest of the following:

      * (a) the *ETP cap amount reduced (but not below zero) by:

        * (i) if the payment is a payment of a kind referred to in subsection (6) (an **_excluded payment_**)--the amount worked out under this subsection for each *life benefit termination payment you have received earlier in the income year to the extent that it is an excluded payment; or

        * (ii) if the payment is not an excluded payment--the amount worked out under this subsection for each life benefit termination payment you have received earlier in the income year;

      * (b) the ETP cap amount reduced (but not below zero) by:

      * (c) if the payment is not an excluded payment--$180,000, reduced (but not below zero) by your taxable income for the income year in which the payment is made.

          * Note 1: For the **_ETP cap amount_**, see section 82160.

          * Note 2: If you have also received a death benefit termination payment in the same income year, your entitlement to a tax offset under this section is not affected by your entitlement (if any) to a tax concession for the death benefit termination payment (under section 8265 or 8270).

          * Note 3: Certain other life benefit termination payments made before 1 July 2012 may be treated as earlier payments under paragraph (4)(b): see section 8210H of the _Income Tax (Transitional Provisions) Act 1997_.

        * (ii) are principally compensation for personal injury, unfair dismissal, harassment, discrimination or a matter prescribed by the regulations; and

        * (iii) exceed the amount that could, at the time of the termination of your employment, reasonably be expected to be received by you in consequence of the voluntary termination of your employment.

    * (7) If the payment is partly an excluded payment:

      * (a) subsection (4) applies as if the payment were 2 payments as follows:

        * (i) first, a payment consisting only of the part of the payment that is an excluded payment;

        * (ii) second, another payment, made immediately after the first payment, consisting only of the part of the payment that is not an excluded payment; and

      * (b) subsection (4) applies to the second payment as if a reference in subsection (5) to the taxable component of a payment were a reference to so much of the taxable component as relates to the part of the payment that is not an excluded payment.

    * (8) Despite subsections (4) and (7), the amount mentioned in subsection (4) in relation to the payment must not exceed either of the following:

      * (a) the *ETP cap amount reduced (but not below zero) by the amount worked out under subsection (4) for each *life benefit termination payment you have received earlier in the income year;

##### Guide to Subdivision 82B

##### 8260  What this Subdivision is about

    * You are entitled to a tax offset on the remaining part of the payment (the taxable component), subject to limitations.

    * The extent of your entitlement to the offset depends on whether or not you were a death benefits dependant of the deceased, and on the total amount of payments you receive in consequence of the same employment termination.

    * If a death benefit termination payment is payable to the trustee of the estate of the deceased for the benefit of another person, the payment is taxed in the hands of the trustee in the same way as it would be taxed if it had been paid directly to the other person.

    * This Subdivision applies to leave (**_long service leave_**) of the following types (whether it is made available as an entitlement or as a privilege), other than annual leave to which section 8310 applies:

      * (a) leave ordinarily known as long service leave, including long leave, furlough and extended leave;

      * (b) any other leave made available in circumstances similar to those in which the leave mentioned in paragraph (a) is ordinarily made available;

      * (c) if your employer has entered into a *scheme or *arrangement for leave and, because of the existence and nature of the scheme or arrangement, the employer does not have to comply with the requirements of a law of the Commonwealth, or of a State or Territory, relating to leave mentioned in paragraph (a) or (b)--leave made available under the scheme or arrangement.

##### 8375  Meaning of unused long service leave payment

    * A payment that you receive in consequence of the termination of your employment is an **_unused long service leave payment _**if:

      * (a) it is for long service leave you have not used; or

      * (b) it is for long service leave to which you were not entitled just before the employment termination, but that would have been made available to you at a later time if it were not for the employment termination.

##### 8380  Taxation of unused long service leave payments

    * Assessable and taxfree parts of unused long service leave payments

    * (1) If you receive an *unused long service leave payment, your assessable income includes the part of the payment shown in this table:

    * (2) The remainder of that part (if any) of an *unused long service leave payment that is attributable to the *pre16/8/78 period is not assessable income and is not *exempt income.

          * Note 1: If your employment was wholly fulltime or wholly parttime during a period, see sections 8395, 83100 and 83105 to work out the amount of an unused long service leave payment that is attributable to the period.

          * Note 2: If your employment was partly fulltime and partly parttime during a period, see section 83110 to work out the amount of an unused long service leave payment that is attributable to the period.

##### 8385  Entitlement to tax offset

    * (1) You are entitled to a *tax offset on an *unused long service leave payment that ensures that the rate of income tax on the amount of the payment mentioned in subsection (2) does not exceed 30%.

    * (2) The amount is the part of the *unused long service leave payment included in your assessable income under subsection 8380(1):

      * (a) to the extent that it is attributable to the *pre18/8/93 period; and

      * (b) to the extent that it is attributable to the *post17/8/93 period, if the payment was made in connection with a payment that includes, or consists of, any of the following:

        * (i) a *genuine redundancy payment; or

        * (ii) an *early retirement scheme payment; or

        * (iii) an *invalidity segment of an *employment termination payment or a *superannuation benefit.

##### 8390  Meaning of pre16/8/78 period, pre18/8/93 period, post17/8/93 period and long service leave employment period

    * (1) The **_pre16/8/78 period_** consists of each day (if any) in your *long service leave employment period that occurred before 16 August 1978.

    * (2) The **_pre18/8/93 period_** consists of each day (if any) in your *long service leave employment period to which the payment relates that occurred after 15 August 1978 and before 18 August 1993.

    * (3) The **_post17/8/93 period_** consists of each day (if any) in your *long service leave employment period to which the payment relates that occurred after 17 August 1993.

    * (4) Your **_long service leave employment period_**, for a period of long service leave, is:

      * (a) the period of employment to which the long service leave relates; or

      * (b) if your entitlement to long service leave changes so that it accrues over a shorter period--the period that would apply under paragraph (a) assuming the change had not happened.

##### Employment wholly fulltime or wholly parttime

##### 8395  How to work out amount of payment attributable to each period

    * (1) Work out how much of an *unused long service leave payment is attributable to a period as follows:

      * (a) for the *pre18/8/93 period or to the *post17/8/93 period--use the formula in subsection (2);

      * (b) for the *pre16/8/78 period--subtract the sum of the amounts (if any) worked out for paragraph (a) for the other 2 periods from the total amount of the payment.

    * (2) For the *pre18/8/93 period or the *post17/8/93 period, the formula is:

    * where: 

    * **_total unused long service leave days_** means the total number of unused days of long service leave in the *long service leave employment period for the payment.

    * **_unused long service leave days in the relevant period _**means the number of unused days of long service leave in the *pre18/8/93 period or the *post17/8/93 period (as applicable), worked out under section 83100.

          * Note 1: For the meaning of **_unused days of long service leave_**, see section 83100.

          * Note 2: Section 83110 explains how to work out the period of unused long service leave if your employment was partly fulltime and partly parttime during the period.

##### 83100  How to work out unused days of long service leave for each period

    * (1) The number of **_unused days of long service leave_** for each of the *pre16/8/78 period, the *pre18/8/93 period and the *post17/8/93 period is the number of days of long service leave that accrued to you during that period less the number of days of long service leave that you used in the period.

    * Exception if days used exceed days accrued in the pre18/8/93 period and the post17/8/93 period

    * (2) To the extent that the number of days of long service leave that you used during the *pre18/8/93 period or the *post17/8/93 period exceeds the number of days of long service leave that accrued to you during the period, apply the excess days as shown in this table:

    * (3) The number of **_unused days of long service leave_** in each period is the number of days after applying the table.

          * Note: Section 83115 explains how to work out the number of days of long service leave you are taken to have used if you took long service leave at less than the full pay rate.

##### 83105  How to work out long service leave accrued in each period

    * (1) Work out the number of days of long service leave that accrued to you during each part of your *long service leave employment period as follows:

      * (a) for the *pre18/8/93 period or the *post17/8/93 period--use the formula in subsection (2);

      * (b) for the *pre16/8/78 period--subtract the sum of the number of days (if any) worked out under paragraph (a) for the other 2 periods from the total number of days of long service leave accrued to you during the long service leave employment period.

    * (2) For the *pre18/8/93 period or the *post17/8/93 period, the formula is:

    * where: 

    * **_relevant period _**means the *pre18/8/93 period or the *post 17/8/93 period (as applicable).

    * How to treat fraction of day

    * (3) If long service leave accrued to you during the *pre18/8/93 period and the *post17/8/93 period but not during the *pre16/8/78 period, and the number of days worked out under subsection (2) for the post17/8/93 period includes a fraction, treat the fraction as having accrued during the pre18/8/93 period.

    * (4) If long service leave accrued to you during all 3 periods and the number of days worked out under subsection (2) for the *post17/8/93 period or the *pre18/8/93 period includes a fraction, treat the fraction as having accrued during the *pre16/8/78 period.

##### Employment partly fulltime and partly parttime

##### 83110  Leave accrued in pre16/8/78, pre18/8/93 and post17/8/93 periods--employment fulltime and parttime

    * (1) This section applies if the *long service leave employment period for an *unused long service leave payment includes:

      * (a) 1 or more periods when you were employed on a fulltime basis; and

      * (b) 1 or more periods when you were employed on a parttime basis.

    * (2) Work out how much of the payment is attributable to the period or periods when you were employed on a fulltime basis (the **_fulltime payment_**_) _and how much to the period or periods when you were employed on a parttime basis (the **_parttime payment_**).

    * (3) The amount of the payment that is attributable to each of the *pre16/8/78 period, the *pre18/8/93 period and the *post17/8/93 period is the sum of the amounts worked out in accordance with sections 8395, 83100 and 83105 that would be attributable to those periods if the fulltime payment and the parttime payment were each *unused long service leave payments.

##### Long service leave taken at less than full pay

##### 83115  Working out used days of long service leave if leave taken at less than full pay

    * If you used days of long service leave at a rate of pay that is less than the rate to which you are entitled, the number of days of long service leave you are taken to have used (disregarding fractions of days) is as follows:

          * Example: If you took 100 actual days of long service leave at a rate of pay of $30 per hour, while the rate of pay to which you were entitled when taking leave is $40 per hour, you are taken to have used 75 days of long service leave, worked out as follows:

##### Subdivision 83C--Genuine redundancy payments and early retirement scheme payments

##### Guide to Subdivision 83C

##### 83165  What this Subdivision is about

    * This Subdivision defines what are genuine redundancy payments and early retirement scheme payments.

    * If you receive a genuine redundancy payment or an early retirement scheme payment, you do not have to pay income tax on the payment so far as it does not exceed a certain amount worked out under this Subdivision.

    * A part of a genuine redundancy payment or an early retirement scheme payment that is not tax free under this Subdivision will normally be an employment termination payment.

##### Operative provisions

##### 83170  Taxfree treatment of genuine redundancy payments and early retirement scheme payments

    * (1) This section applies if you receive a *genuine redundancy payment or an *early retirement scheme payment.

          * Note: A payment cannot be both a genuine redundancy payment and an early retirement scheme payment, because of the nature of each of these types of payment: see sections 83175 and 83180.

    * (2) So much of the relevant payment as does not exceed the amount worked out under subsection (3) is not assessable income and is not *exempt income.

    * (3) Work out the amount using the formula:

    * where: 

    * **_base amount_** means:

      * (a) for the income year 20062007--$6,783; and

      * (b) for a later income year--the amount mentioned in paragraph (a) indexed annually.

          * Note: Subdivision 960M shows you how to index the base amount.

    * **_service amount_** means:

      * (a) for the income year 20062007--$3,392; and

      * (b) for a later income year--the amount mentioned in paragraph (a) indexed annually.

          * Note: Subdivision 960M shows you how to index the service amount.

    * **_years of service _**means the number of whole years in the period, or sum of periods, of employment to which the payment relates.

          * Note: The remaining part of a genuine redundancy payment or an early retirement scheme payment (apart from the amount mentioned in subsection (3)) is an employment termination payment if section 82130 applies to that part.

##### 83175  What is a genuine redundancy payment?

    * (1) A **_genuine redundancy payment _**is so much of a payment received by an employee who is dismissed from employment because the employee's position is genuinely redundant as exceeds the amount that could reasonably be expected to be received by the employee in consequence of the voluntary termination of his or her employment at the time of the dismissal.

    * (2) A **_genuine redundancy payment_** must satisfy the following conditions:

      * (a) the employee is dismissed before the earlier of the following:

        * (i) the day he or she turned 65;

        * (ii) if the employee's employment would have terminated when he or she reached a particular age or completed a particular period of service--the day he or she would reach the age or complete the period of service (as the case may be);

      * (b) if the dismissal was not at *arm's length--the payment does not exceed the amount that could reasonably be expected to be made if the dismissal were at arm's length;

      * (c) at the time of the dismissal, there was no *arrangement between the employee and the employer, or between the employer and another person, to employ the employee after the dismissal.

    * (3) However, a **_genuine redundancy payment_** does not include any part of a payment that was received by the employee in lieu of *superannuation benefits to which the employee may have become entitled at the time the payment was received or at a later time.

    * Payments not covered

    * (4) A payment is _not_ a **_genuine redundancy payment_** if it is a payment mentioned in section 82135 (apart from paragraph 82135(e)).

          * Note: Paragraph 82135(e) provides that the part of a genuine redundancy payment or an early retirement scheme payment worked out under section 83170 is not an employment termination payment.

##### 83180  What is an early retirement scheme payment?

    * (1) An **_early retirement scheme payment_** is so much of a payment received by an employee because the employee retires under an *early retirement scheme as exceeds the amount that could reasonably be expected to be received by the employee in consequence of the voluntary termination of his or her employment at the time of the retirement.

    * (2) An **_early retirement scheme payment_** must satisfy the following conditions:

      * (a) the employee retires before the earlier of the following:

        * (i) the day he or she turned 65;

        * (ii) if the employee's employment would have terminated when he or she reached a particular age or completed a particular period of service--the day he or she would reach the age or complete the period of service (as the case may be);

      * (b) if the retirement is not at *arm's length--the payment does not exceed the amount that could reasonably be expected to be made if the retirement were at arm's length;

      * (c) at the time of the retirement, there was no *arrangement between the employee and the employer, or between the employer and another person, to employ the employee after the retirement.

    * (3) A scheme is an **_early retirement scheme_** if:

      * (a) all the employer's employees who comprise such a class of employees as the Commissioner approves may participate in the scheme; and

      * (b) the employer's purpose in implementing the scheme is to rationalise or reorganise the employer's operations by making any change to the employer's operations, or the nature of the work force, that the Commissioner approves; and

      * (c) before the scheme is implemented, the Commissioner, by written instrument, approves the scheme as an early retirement scheme for the purposes of this section.

    * (4) A scheme is also an **_early retirement scheme_** if:

      * (a) paragraph (3)(a) or (b) does not apply; and

      * (b) the Commissioner is satisfied that special circumstances exist in relation to the scheme that make it reasonable to approve the scheme; and

      * (c) before the scheme is implemented, the Commissioner, by written instrument, approves the scheme as an early retirement scheme for the purposes of this section.

    * (5) However, an **_early retirement scheme payment_** does not include any part of the payment that was paid to the employee in lieu of *superannuation benefits to which the employee may have become entitled at the time the payment was made or at a later time.

    * Payments not covered

    * (6) A payment is _not_ an **_early retirement scheme payment_** if it is a payment mentioned in section 82135 (apart from paragraph 82135(e)).

          * Note: Paragraph 82135(e) provides that the part of a genuine redundancy payment or an early retirement scheme payment worked out under section 83170 is not an employment termination payment.

      * (a) to ensure that benefits provided to employees under *employee share schemes are subject to income tax at the employees' marginal rates under *income tax law (instead of being subject to *fringe benefits tax law); and

      * (b) to increase the extent to which the interests of employees are aligned with those of their employers, by providing a tax concession to encourage lower and middle income earners to acquire *shares under such schemes.

##### 83A10  Meaning of ESS interest and employee share scheme

    * (1) An **_ESS interest_**, in a company, is a beneficial interest in:

##### Subdivision 83AB--Immediate inclusion of discount in assessable income

##### Guide to Subdivision 83AB

##### 83A15  What this Subdivision is about

    * Generally, a discount you receive on shares, rights or stapled securities you acquire under an employee share scheme is included in your assessable income when you acquire the beneficial interest in those shares, rights or securities.

    * You may be entitled to reduce the amount included in your assessable income if you meet certain conditions which seek to limit the concession to genuine schemes broadly available to all permanent employees who do not already have anything other than a minor interest in their employer.

    * The income year in which you are taxed may be deferred if there is a real risk of forfeiture, or you acquired the shares or securities under particular salary sacrifice arrangements (see Subdivision 83AC).

    * If you are a foreign resident, only the part of the discount that relates to your employment in Australia is included in your assessable income.

##### Operative provisions

##### 83A20  Application of Subdivision

    * (1) This Subdivision applies to an *ESS interest if you acquire the interest under an *employee share scheme at a discount.

          * Note 1: This Subdivision does not apply if Subdivision 83AC applies: see section 83A105.

          * Note 2: If an associate of yours acquires an interest in relation to your employment, this Division applies as if you, rather than your associate, acquired the interest: see section 83A305.

          * Note 3: Regulations made for the purposes of section 83A315 may be relevant to working out whether you acquire the ESS interest at a discount.

    * (2) However, this Subdivision does not apply if the *ESS interest is a beneficial interest in a *share that you acquire as a result of exercising a right, if you acquired a beneficial interest in the right under an *employee share scheme.

##### 83A25  Discount to be included in assessable income

    * (1) Your assessable income for the income year in which you acquire the *ESS interest includes the discount given in relation to the interest.

          * Note: For the CGT treatment of employee share schemes, see Subdivision 130D.

##### 83A30  Amount for which discounted ESS interest acquired

    * For the purposes of this Act (other than this Division), the *ESS interest (and the *share or right of which it forms part) is taken to have been acquired for its *market value (rather than for its discounted value).

          * Note: Regulations made for the purposes of section 83A315 may substitute a different amount for the market value of the ESS interest.

##### 83A35  Reduction of amounts included in assessable income

    * Reduction and income test

    * (1) Reduce the total amount included in your assessable income under subsection 83A25(1) for an income year by the total of the amounts included in your assessable income under that subsection, for the income year, for *ESS interests to which subsections (3) to (9) of this section apply.

    * (2) However:

      * (a) do not reduce the total amount by more than $1,000; and

      * (b) only make the reduction if the sum of the following does not exceed $180,000:

        * (i) your taxable income for the income year (including any amount that would be included in your taxable income if you disregarded this section);

        * (ii) your *reportable fringe benefits total for the income year;

        * (iii) your *reportable superannuation contributions (if any) for the income year;

        * (iv) your *total net investment loss for the income year.

    * (5) This subsection applies to an *ESS interest in a company unless, when you acquire the interest:

      * (a) the predominant business of the company (whether or not stated in its constituent documents) is the acquisition, sale or holding of *shares, securities or other investments (whether directly or indirectly through one or more companies, partnerships or trusts); and

    * are operated on a nondiscriminatory basis in relation to at least 75% of the permanent employees of your employer who have completed at least 3 years of service (whether continuous or noncontinuous) with your employer and who are Australian residents.

    * No risk of losing interest or share under the conditions of the scheme

    * (7) This subsection applies to an *ESS interest you acquire under an *employee share scheme if, when you acquire the interest:

      * (a) if the ESS interest is a beneficial interest in a *share--there is no real risk that, under the conditions of the scheme, you will forfeit or lose the ESS interest (other than by disposing of it); or

      * (b) if the ESS interest is a beneficial interest in a right to acquire a beneficial interest in a *share:

        * (i) there is no real risk that, under the conditions of the scheme, you will forfeit or lose the ESS interest (other than by disposing of it, exercising the right or letting the right lapse); and

        * (ii) there is no real risk that, under the conditions of the scheme, if you exercise the right, you will forfeit or lose the beneficial interest in the share (other than by disposing of it).

    * Minimum holding period

    * (8) This subsection applies to an *ESS interest you acquire under an *employee share scheme if, at all times during the period that:

      * (a) starts when you acquire the interest; and

      * (b) ends at the earlier of:

        * (i) 3 years later; and

        * (ii) when you cease being employed by your employer;

    * the scheme is operated so that: 

      * (c) you are not permitted to dispose of:

        * (i) any ESS interest (the **_scheme interest_**) you acquire under the scheme; or

        * (ii) a beneficial interest in a *share you acquire as a result of a scheme interest;

      * before the earlier of: 

        * (iii) the end of the period of 3 years after you acquire the scheme interest; and

        * (iv) when you cease being employed by your employer; and

      * (d) everyone else who acquires ESS interests under the scheme is subject to a corresponding restriction.

          * Note: This subsection is taken to apply in the case of a takeover or restructure: see subsection 83A130(3).

    * 5% limit on shareholding and voting power

    * (9) This subsection applies to an *ESS interest in a company if, immediately after you acquire the interest:

      * (a) you do not hold a beneficial interest in more than 5% of the *shares in the company; and

      * (b) you are not in a position to cast, or to control the casting of, more than 5% of the maximum number of votes that might be cast at a general meeting of the company.

##### Subdivision 83AC--Deferred inclusion of gain in assessable income

##### Guide to Subdivision 83AC

##### 83A100  What this Subdivision is about

    * If there is a real risk you might forfeit the share, right or stapled security you acquired under an employee share scheme, you don't include the discount in your assessable income when you acquired it. Instead, in the first income year you are able to dispose of the share, right or security, your assessable income will include any gain you have made to that time. If you cease employment earlier, or if 7 years pass, the gain is included in that income year instead.

    * A share or stapled security you acquire under salary sacrifice arrangements can also be subject to this deferred taxing point if you get no more than $5,000 worth of shares under those arrangements.

##### Main provisions

##### 83A105  Application of Subdivision

    * Scope of Subdivision

    * (1) This Subdivision applies, and Subdivision 83AB does not apply, to an *ESS interest in a company if:

      * (a) Subdivision 83AB would, apart from this section, apply to the interest (see section 83A20); and

      * (b) subsections 83A35(3), (4), (5) and (9) apply to the interest; and

      * (c) if the interest is a beneficial interest in a *share:

        * (ii) subsection (3) or (4) applies to the interest; and

      * (d) if the interest is a beneficial interest in a right to acquire a beneficial interest in a share--subsection (3) applies to the interest.

          * Note: Subsections 83A35(3), (4), (5), and (9) contain conditions relating to the following:

            * (a) your employment;

            * (b) the types of shares available under the employee share scheme;

            * (c) share trading and investment companies;

            * (d) your shareholding and voting power in the company.

    * Broad availability of schemes

    * (2) This subsection applies to an *ESS interest you acquire under an *employee share scheme if, when you acquire the interest, at least 75% of the permanent employees of your employer who have completed at least 3 years of service (whether continuous or noncontinuous) with your employer and who are Australian residents are, or at some earlier time had been, entitled to acquire:

      * (a) ESS interests under the scheme; or

      * (b) ESS interests in:

        * (i) your employer; or

        * (ii) a holding company (within the meaning of the _Corporations Act 2001_) of your employer;

      * under another employee share scheme.

    * Real risk of losing interest or share under the conditions of the scheme

    * (3) This subsection applies to an *ESS interest you acquire under an *employee share scheme if, when you acquire the interest:

      * (a) if the ESS interest is a beneficial interest in a *share--there is a real risk that, under the conditions of the scheme, you will forfeit or lose the ESS interest (other than by disposing of it); or

      * (b) if the ESS interest is a beneficial interest in a right to acquire a beneficial interest in a share:

        * (i) there is a real risk that, under the conditions of the scheme, you will forfeit or lose the ESS interest (other than by disposing of it, exercising the right or letting the right lapse); or

        * (ii) there is a real risk that, under the conditions of the scheme, if you exercise the right, you will forfeit or lose the beneficial interest in the share (other than by disposing of it).

    * Salary sacrifice arrangement

    * (4) This subsection applies to an *ESS interest you acquire under an *employee share scheme during an income year at a discount if:

      * (a) the interest is provided:

        * (i) because you agreed to acquire the interest in return for a reduction in your salary or wages that would not have happened apart from the agreement; or

        * (ii) as part of your remuneration package, in circumstances where it is reasonable to conclude that your salary or wages would be greater if the interest was not made part of that package; and

      * (b) at the time you acquire the interest:

        * (i) the discount equals the *market value of the ESS interest; and

        * (ii) all of the ESS interests available for acquisition under the scheme are ESS interests to which subsection (3) applies, beneficial interests in *shares, or both; and

        * (iii) the governing rules of the scheme expressly state that this Subdivision applies to the scheme (subject to the requirements of this Act); and

      * (c) the total *market value of the *ESS interests in your employer and any holding company (within the meaning of the _Corporations Act 2001_) of your employer:

        * (i) that you acquire during the year under any employee share scheme or schemes; and

        * (ii) to which both this Subdivision and this subsection apply;

      * does not exceed $5,000.

    * (5) For the purposes of paragraph (4)(c), work out the *market value of each *ESS interest as at the time you acquire it.

          * Note: Regulations made for the purposes of section 83A315 may substitute a different amount for the market value of the ESS interest.

##### 83A110  Amount to be included in assessable income

    * (1) Your assessable income for the income year in which the *ESS deferred taxing point for the *ESS interest occurs includes the *market value of the interest at the ESS deferred taxing point, reduced by the *cost base of the interest.

          * Note: Regulations made for the purposes of section 83A315 may substitute a different amount for the market value of the ESS interest.

    * _	_(2)	Treat an amount included in your assessable income under subsection (1) as being from a source other than an *Australian source to the extent that it relates to your employment outside Australia.

          * Note: For the CGT treatment of employee share schemes, see Subdivision 130D.

##### 83A115  ESS deferred taxing point--shares

    * Scope

    * (1) This section applies if the *ESS interest is a beneficial interest in a *share.

    * Meaning of **ESS deferred taxing point**

    * **	(2)	The **_ESS deferred taxing point_** for the *ESS interest is the earliest of the times mentioned in subsections (4) to (6).

    * (3) However, the **_ESS deferred taxing point_** for the *ESS interest is instead the time you dispose of the interest, if that time occurs within 30 days after the time worked out under subsection (2).

    * No restrictions on disposing of share

    * (4) The first possible taxing point is the earliest time when:

      * (a) there is no real risk that, under the conditions of the *employee share scheme, you will forfeit or lose the *ESS interest (other than by disposing of it); and

      * (b) if, at the time you acquired the interest, the scheme genuinely restricted you immediately disposing of the interest--the scheme no longer so restricts you.

    * Cessation of employment

    * (5) The 2nd possible taxing point is the time when the employment in respect of which you acquired the interest ends.

    * Maximum time period for deferral

    * (6) The 3rd possible taxing point is the end of the 7 year period starting when you acquired the interest.

##### 83A120  ESS deferred taxing point--rights to acquire shares

    * Scope

    * (1) This section applies if the *ESS interest is a beneficial interest in a right to acquire a beneficial interest in a *share.

    * Meaning of **ESS deferred taxing point**

    * **	(2)	The **_ESS deferred taxing point_** for the *ESS interest is the earliest of the times mentioned in subsections (4) to (7).

    * (3) However, the **_ESS deferred taxing point_** for the *ESS interest is:

      * (a) the time you dispose of the ESS interest (other than by exercising the right); or

      * (b) if you exercise the right--the time you dispose of the beneficial interest in the *share;

    * if that time occurs within 30 days after the time worked out under subsection (2).

    * No restrictions on disposing of right

    * (4) The first possible taxing point is the earliest time when:

      * (a) you have not exercised the right; and

      * (b) there is no real risk that, under the conditions of the *employee share scheme, you will forfeit or lose the *ESS interest (other than by disposing of it, exercising the right or letting the right lapse); and

      * (c) if, at the time you acquired the ESS interest, the scheme genuinely restricted you immediately disposing of the ESS interest--the scheme no longer so restricts you.

    * Cessation of employment

    * (5) The 2nd possible taxing point is the time when the employment in respect of which you acquired the interest ends.

    * Maximum time period for deferral

    * (6) The 3rd possible taxing point is the end of the 7 year period starting when you acquired the interest.

    * No restrictions on exercising right and disposing of share

    * (7) The 4th possible taxing point is the earliest time when:

      * (a) there is no real risk that, under the conditions of the scheme, you will forfeit or lose the *ESS interest (other than by disposing of it, exercising the right or letting the right lapse); and

      * (b) if, at the time you acquired the ESS interest, the scheme genuinely restricted you immediately exercising the right--the scheme no longer so restricts you; and

      * (d) if, at the time you acquired the ESS interest, the scheme genuinely restricted you immediately disposing of the beneficial interest in the share if you exercised the right--the scheme no longer so restricts you.

##### 83A125  Tax treatment of ESS interests held after ESS deferred taxing points

    * For the purposes of this Act (other than this Division), the *ESS interest (and the *share or right of which it forms part) is taken to have been acquired immediately after the *ESS deferred taxing point for the interest for its *market value, unless the ESS deferred taxing point occurs at the time the interest is disposed of.

          * Note: Regulations made for the purposes of section 83A315 may substitute a different amount for the market value of the ESS interest.

##### Takeovers and restructures

##### 83A130  Takeovers and restructures

    * Object and scope

    * (1) The object of this section is to allow this Division to continue to apply if:

      * (a) at least one of the following applies:

        * (i) an *arrangement (the **_takeover_**) is entered into that is intended to result in a company (the **_old company_**) becoming a *100% subsidiary of another company;

        * (ii) *ESS interests in a company (the **_old company_**) acquired under *employee share schemes can reasonably be regarded as having been replaced, wholly or partly, by ESS interests in one or more other companies as a result of a change (the **_restructure_**) in the ownership (including the structure of the ownership) of the old company; and

      * (b) just before the takeover or restructure, you held ESS interests (the **_old interests_**) in the old company that you acquired under an employee share scheme.

    * Treat new interests as continuations of old interests

    * (2) For the purposes of this Division, treat any *ESS interests (the **_new interests_**) in a company (the **_new company_**) that you acquire in connection with the takeover or restructure as a continuation of the old interests, to the extent that:

      * (a) as a result of the arrangement or change, you stop holding the old interests; and

      * (b) the new interests can reasonably be regarded as matching any of the old interests.

          * Note: In determining to what extent something can reasonably be regarded as matching any of the old interests, one of the factors to consider is the respective market values of that thing and of the old interests.

    * (3) Subsection 83A35(8) (about the 3 year rule) is taken to apply to the *ESS interests.

    * (4) Subsections (2) and (3) only apply if the new interests relate to ordinary *shares.

    * Old interest not matched by new interests

    * (5) For the purposes of this Division, treat yourself as having disposed of the old interests to the extent that, in connection with the takeover or restructure, you acquire anything that:

      * (a) can reasonably be regarded as matching any of the old interests; but

      * (b) is not treated by subsection (2) as a continuation of those interests.

    * Continuation of your employment

    * (6) For the purposes of this Division, treat your employment by:

      * (a) the new company; or

      * (b) a *subsidiary of the new company; or

      * (c) a holding company (within the meaning of the _Corporations Act 2001_) of the new company; or

      * (d) a subsidiary of a holding company (within the meaning of the _Corporations Act 2001_) of the new company;

    * as a continuation of the employment in respect of which you acquired the old interests.

    * Apportionment of cost base of old interests

    * (7) Treat yourself as having given, as consideration for the assets mentioned in subsection (8), the amount worked out by apportioning among those assets, according to their respective *market values immediately after the takeover or restructure, the total of:

      * (a) the *cost bases of the old interests when you stop holding them; and

      * (b) the cost bases of the assets mentioned in paragraph (8)(b) immediately after the takeover or restructure (ignoring the effect of this subsection).

    * (8) The assets are:

      * (a) the things that:

        * (i) you acquired in connection with the takeover or restructure; and

        * (ii) can reasonably be regarded as matching the old interests;

      * (including all of the new interests); and

      * (b) in a case covered by subparagraph (1)(a)(ii)--any *ESS interests in the old company that:

        * (i) you held just before, and continue to hold just after, the restructure; and

        * (ii) that can reasonably be regarded as matching the old interests.

    * Exceptions

    * (9) This section only applies if:

      * (a) at or about the time you acquire the new interests, you are employed as mentioned in subsection (6); and

      * (b) at the time you acquire the new interests:

        * (i) you do not hold a beneficial interest in more than 5% of the *shares in the new company; and

        * (ii) you are not in a position to cast, or to control the casting of, more than 5% of the maximum number of votes that might be cast at a general meeting of the new company.

##### Subdivision 83AD--Deduction for employer

##### Guide to Subdivision 83AD

##### 83A200  What this Subdivision is about

    * You can deduct an amount for shares, rights or stapled securities you provide to your employees under an employee share scheme if they are eligible for a reduction in their assessable income under section 83A35. The amount you can deduct is equal to that reduction.

    * You must defer any deduction you are entitled to for amounts you provide to finance your employees acquiring interests in shares, rights or stapled securities under an employee share scheme until the employees have actually acquired those interests.

##### Table of sections

       * 83A210	Timing of general deductions

##### Operative provisions

##### 83A205  Deduction for employer

    * (1) You can deduct an amount for an income year if:

      * (a) during the year you provided one or more *ESS interests to an individual under an *employee share scheme; and

      * (b) you did so as:

        * (i) the employer of the individual; or

        * (ii) a holding company (within the meaning of the _Corporations Act 2001_) of the employer of the individual; and

      * (c) section 83A35 applies to reduce the amount included in the individual's assessable income under subsection 83A25(1) in relation to some or all of the interests.

    * (2) Disregard paragraph 83A35(2)(b) (income test) for the purposes of paragraph (1)(c) of this section.

    * (3) The amount of the deduction is the amount of the reduction mentioned in paragraph (1)(c).

    * Deduction to be apportioned if interest provided by multiple entities

    * (4) The amount of the deduction worked out under subsection (3) must be apportioned between 2 or more entities on a reasonable basis if the entities jointly provide an *ESS interest for which an amount can be deducted under subsection (1).

##### 83A210  Timing of general deductions

    * If: 

      * (a) at a particular time, you provide another entity with money or other property:

        * (i) under an *arrangement; and

        * (ii) for the purpose of enabling an individual (the **_ultimate beneficiary_**) to acquire, directly or indirectly, an *ESS interest under an *employee share scheme in relation to the ultimate beneficiary's employment (including past or prospective employment); and

      * (b) that particular time occurs before the time (the **_acquisition time_**) the ultimate beneficiary acquires the *ESS interest;

    * then, for the purpose of determining the income year (if any) in which you can deduct an amount in respect of the provision of the money or other property, you are taken to have provided the money or other property at the acquisition time.

       * 83A340	Application of Division to indeterminate rights

##### 83A305  Acquisition by associates

    * _	_	If an *associate (other than an *employee share trust) of an individual acquires an *ESS interest in relation to the individual's employment (including past or prospective employment), then, for the purposes of this Division:

      * (a) treat the interest as having being acquired by the individual (instead of the associate); and

      * (b) treat any circumstance, right or obligation existing or not existing in relation to the interest in relation to the associate as existing or not existing in relation to the individual; and

      * (c) treat anything done or not done by or in relation to the associate in relation to the interest as being done or not done by or in relation to the individual.

          * Example 1: The following are attributed to the employee, rather than to the associate:

            * (a) the associate's voting rights;

            * (b) the associate's ability or inability to dispose of the ESS interest;

            * (c) whether there is a real risk that the associate may lose the ESS interest;

            * (d) the associate's cost base for the ESS interest.

          * Example 2: If the associate disposes of the ESS interest, the employee is taken to have disposed of the ESS interest instead.

##### 83A310  Forfeiture etc. of ESS interest

    * This Division (apart from this Subdivision) is taken never to have applied in relation to an *ESS interest acquired by an individual under an *employee share scheme if:

      * (a) disregarding this section, an amount is included in the individual's assessable income under this Division in relation to the interest; and

      * (b) either:

        * (i) the individual forfeits the interest; or

        * (ii) in the case of an ESS interest that is a beneficial interest in a right--the individual forfeits or loses the interest (without having disposed of the interest or exercised the right); and

      * (c) the forfeiture or loss is not the result of:

        * (i) a choice made by the individual (other than a choice by that individual to cease particular employment); or

        * (ii) a condition of the scheme that has the direct effect of protecting (wholly or partly) the individual against a fall in the *market value of the interest.

##### 83A315  Market value of ESS interest

    * (1) Whenever this Division uses the *market value of an *ESS interest, instead use the amount specified in the regulations for the purposes of this section in relation to the interest, if the regulations specify such an amount.

    * (2) To avoid doubt, apply the rule in subsection (1) to the *market value component of any calculation for the purposes of this Division that involves market value.

          * Example: If the regulations specify an amount in relation to an ESS interest, use that amount instead of the market value of the interest in working out:

            * (a) whether there is a discount given in relation to interest; and

            * (b) if so--the amount of the discount.

##### 83A320  Interests in a trust

    * (1) This section applies if, at a time:

      * (a) you hold an interest in a trust whose assets include *shares; and

      * (b) that interest corresponds to a particular number of the shares (even if the interest does not correspond to particular shares).

    * (2) For the purposes of this Division, treat yourself as holding at that time a beneficial interest in each of a number of the *shares included in the assets of the trust equal to the number mentioned in paragraph (1)(b).

    * (3) If there are 2 or more classes of *shares included in the assets of the trust, this section operates separately in relation to each class as if the shares in that class were all the shares included in the assets of the trust.

    * (4) This section applies to rights to acquire beneficial interests in *shares in the same way it applies to shares.

          * Note: For the CGT treatment of employee share schemes, see Subdivision 130D.

##### 83A325  Application of Division to relationships similar to employment

    * This Division applies to an individual covered by column 1 of an item in the table as if: 

      * (a) he or she were employed by the entity referred to in column 2 of that item; and

      * (b) the thing referred to column 3 of that item constituted that employment.

##### 83A330  Application of Division to ceasing employment

    * For the purposes of this Division, you are treated as ceasing employment when you are no longer employed by any of the following:

      * (a) your employer in that employment;

      * (b) a holding company (within the meaning of the _Corporations Act 2001_) of your employer;

      * (c) a *subsidiary of your employer;

      * (d) a *subsidiary of a holding company (within the meaning of the _Corporations Act 2001_) of your employer.

##### 83A335  Application of Division to stapled securities

    * (1) This Division applies in relation to a stapled security in the same way as it applies in relation to a *share in a company, if at least one of the *ownership interests that are stapled together to form the stapled security is a share in the company.

          * Note: This means the Division also applies to rights to acquire such a stapled security in the same way it applies to rights to acquire a share.

    * (2) This Division applies in relation to a stapled security in the same way as it applies in relation to an ordinary *share in a company, if at least one of the *ownership interests that are stapled together to form the stapled security is an ordinary share in the company.

    * (3) For the purposes of this Division, in relation to a stapled security or right to acquire a beneficial interest in a stapled security, a company is taken to include (as part of the company) each *stapled entity for the stapled security, if at least one of the *ownership interests that are stapled together to form the stapled security is a *share in the company.

##### 83A340  Application of Division to indeterminate rights

    * (1) This section applies if:

      * (a) you acquire a beneficial interest in a right; and

      * (b) the right later becomes a right to acquire a beneficial interest in a *share.

          * Example 1: You acquire a right to acquire, at a future time:

            * (a) shares with a specified total value, rather than a specified number of shares; or

            * (b) an indeterminate number of shares.

          * Example 2: You acquire a right under which the provider must provide you with either ESS interests or cash, whichever the provider chooses.

    * (2) This Division applies as if the right had always been a right to acquire the beneficial interest in the *share.

#### Division 84--Introduction

##### Guide to Part 242

##### 841  What this Part is about

    * This Part is about 2 issues relating to personal services income.

    * Division 85 limits the entitlements of individuals to deductions relating to their personal services income.

    * Division 86 sets out the tax consequences of individuals' personal services income being diverted to other entities (often called alienation of the income).

    * These Divisions do not affect individuals or other entities that conduct personal services businesses. Division 87 defines personal services businesses.

          * Note: This Part may not apply until the 200203 income year to participants in the prescribed payments system on 13 April 2000: see item 26 of Schedule 1 to the _New Business Tax System (Alienation of Personal Services Income) Act 2000_.

    * (1) Your *ordinary income or *statutory income, or the ordinary income or statutory income of any other entity, is your **_personal services income_** if the income is mainly a reward for your personal efforts or skills (or would mainly be such a reward if it was your income).

          * Example 1: NewIT Pty. Ltd. provides computer programming services, but Ron does all the work involved in providing those services. Ron uses the clients' equipment and software to do the work. NewIT's ordinary income from providing the services is Ron's personal services income because it is a reward for his personal efforts or skills.

          * Example 2: Trux Pty. Ltd. owns one semitrailer, and Tom is the only person who drives it. Trux's ordinary income from transporting goods is not Tom's personal services income because it is produced mainly by use of the semitrailer, and not mainly as a reward for Tom's personal efforts or skills.

          * Example 3: Jim works as an accountant for a large accounting firm that employs many accountants. None of the firm's ordinary income or statutory income is Jim's personal services income because it is produced mainly by the firm's business structure, and not mainly as a reward for Jim's personal efforts or skills.

    * (2) Only individuals can have personal services income.

    * (3) This section applies whether the income is for doing work or is for producing a result.

    * (4) The fact that the income is payable under a contract does not stop the income being mainly a reward for your personal efforts or skills.

##### 8410  This Part does not imply that individuals are employees

    * The application of this Part to an individual does not imply, for the purposes of any *Australian law or any instrument made under an Australian law, that the individual is an employee.

#### Division 85--Deductions relating to personal services income

##### Guide to Division 85

##### 851  What this Division is about

    * This Division sets out amounts, relating to personal services income, that an individual cannot deduct. In particular, deductions that are unavailable to an employee are similarly unavailable to an individual who has personal services income and who is not an employee.

    * However, this Division does not apply if the individual is conducting a personal services business or receives the income as an employee or office holder.

       * 8540	Application of Subdivision 900B to individuals who are not employees

##### Operative provisions

##### 855  Object of this Division

    * The object of this Division is to ensure that individuals who are not conducting *personal services businesses cannot deduct certain amounts (such as amounts that employees cannot deduct).

          * Note: This Division also affects the extent to which a personal services entity is entitled to deductions relating to gaining or producing an individual's personal services income: see section 8660.

##### 8510  Deductions for nonemployees relating to personal services income

    * (1) You cannot deduct under this Act an amount to the extent that it relates to gaining or producing that part of your *ordinary income or *statutory income that is your *personal services income if:

      * (a) the income is not payable to you as an employee; and

      * (b) you would not be able to deduct the amount under this Act if the income were payable to you as an employee.

          * Example: Ruth is an architect who works as an independent contractor for one firm. She is not conducting a personal services business. On most days she travels from her home to the business premises of the firm, where she does her work. She also has a home office, where she does some of her work.

          * This section confirms that Ruth cannot deduct her expenses of travelling between her home and the firm's premises because she could not deduct them if she were an employee.

    * (2) Subsection (1) does not stop you deducting an amount to the extent that it relates to:

      * (a) gaining work; or

            * Examples: Advertising, tendering and quoting for work.

      * (b) insuring against loss of your income or your income earning capacity; or

            * Examples: Sickness, accident and disability insurance.

      * (c) insuring against liability arising from your acts or omissions in the course of earning income; or

            * Examples: Public liability insurance and professional indemnity insurance.

      * (d) engaging an entity that is not your *associate to perform work; or

      * (e) engaging your *associate to perform work that forms part of the principal work for which you gain or produce your *personal services income; or

      * (f) contributing to a fund in order to obtain *superannuation benefits for yourself or for your *SIS dependants in the event of your death; or

            * Note: For deductions for superannuation contributions: see Subdivision 290C.

      * (g) meeting your obligations under a *workers' compensation law to pay premiums, contributions or similar payments or to make payments to an employee in respect of *compensable workrelated trauma; or

      * (h) meeting your obligations, or exercising your rights, under the *GST law.

##### 8515  Deductions for rent, mortgage interest, rates and land tax

    * You cannot deduct under this Act an amount of rent, mortgage interest, rates or land tax:

      * (a) for some or all of your residence; or

      * (b) for some or all of your *associate's residence;

    * to the extent that the amount relates to gaining or producing your *personal services income.

##### 8520  Deductions for payments to associates etc.

    * (1) You cannot deduct under this Act:

      * (a) any payment you make to your *associate; or

      * (b) any amount you incur arising from an obligation you have to your associate;

    * to the extent that the payment or amount relates to gaining or producing your *personal services income.

    * (2) Subsection (1) does not stop you deducting a payment or amount to the extent that it relates to engaging your *associate to perform work that forms part of the principal work for which you gain or produce your *personal services income.

    * (3) An amount or payment that you cannot deduct because of this section is neither assessable income nor *exempt income of your *associate.

##### 8525  Deductions for superannuation for associates

    * (1) You cannot deduct under this Act a contribution you make to a fund or an *RSA to provide for *superannuation benefits payable for your *associate, to the extent that the associate's work for you relates to gaining or producing your *personal services income.

    * (2) Subsection (1) does not stop you deducting a contribution to the extent that your *associate's performance of work forms part of the principal work for which you gain or produce your *personal services income.

    * (3) However, if subsection (2) applies, your deduction cannot exceed the amount you would have to contribute, for the benefit of the *associate, to a *complying superannuation fund or an *RSA in order to ensure that you did not have any *individual superannuation guarantee shortfalls in respect of the associate for any of the *quarters in the income year.

    * (4) To work out the amount you would have to contribute for the purposes of subsection (3), the *associate's salary or wages, for the purposes of the _Superannuation Guarantee (Administration) Act 1992_, are taken to be the amount that neither section 8510 nor 8520 prevent you deducting for salary or wages you paid to the associate.

          * Note: See paragraph 8510(2)(e) for deductions relating to employment of associates.

##### 8530  Exception: personal services businesses

    * This Division does not apply to an amount, payment or contribution to the extent that the amount, payment or contribution relates to income from you conducting a *personal services business.

##### 8535  Exception: employees, office holders and religious practitioners

    * (1) This Division does not apply to an amount, payment or contribution to the extent that the amount, payment or contribution relates to *personal services income that you receive as:

      * (a) an employee; or

      * (b) an individual referred to in paragraph 1245(1)(a), (b), (c), (d) or (e) (about payments to office holders) in Schedule 1 to the _Taxation Administration Act 1953_.

    * (2) This Division does not apply to an amount, payment or contribution to the extent that the amount, payment or contribution relates to a payment referred to in section 1247 in Schedule 1 to the _Taxation Administration Act 1953 _(payments to *religious practitioners).

##### 8540  Application of Subdivision 900B to individuals who are not employees

    * This Division does not have the effect of applying Subdivision 900B (about substantiating work expenses) to an individual who is not an employee.

#### Division 86--Alienation of personal services income

##### Table of Subdivisions

  * Guide to Division 86

      * 86A	General

      * 86B	Entitlement to deductions

##### Guide to Division 86

##### 861  What this Division is about

    * Income from the rendering of your personal services is treated as your assessable income if it is the income of another entity and is not promptly paid to you as salary.

    * However, this does not apply if the other entity is conducting a personal services business.

    * There are limits to the other entity's entitlement to deductions to offset against the amount treated as your income.

##### 865  A simple description of what this Division does

    * (1) This diagram shows an example of a simple arrangement for the alienation of personal services income.

          * Note 1: Solid lines indicate actual payments between the parties. Dotted lines indicate other interactions between the parties.

          * Note 2: This Division also applies to different and more complex arrangements.

    * (2) This Division has the effect of attributing the personal services entity's income from the personal services to the individual who performed them (unless the income is promptly paid to the individual as salary). Certain deduction entitlements of the personal services entity can reduce the amount of the attribution.

       * 8635	Later payments of, or entitlements to, personal services income to be disregarded for income tax purposes

       * 8640	Salary payments shortly after an income year

##### 8610  Object of this Division

    * The object of this Division is to ensure that individuals cannot reduce or defer their income tax (and other liabilities) by alienating their *personal services income through companies, partnerships or trusts that are not conducting *personal services businesses.

          * Note: The general antiavoidance provisions of Part IVA of the _Income Tax Assessment Act 1936 _may still apply to cases of alienation of personal services income that fall outside this Division.

##### 8615  Effect of obtaining personal services income through a personal services entity

    * Amounts included in your assessable income

    * (1) Your assessable income includes an amount of *ordinary income or *statutory income of a *personal services entity that is your *personal services income.

          * Example: Continuing example 1 in section 845: Assume that NewIT only provides services to one client. Ron's assessable income includes ordinary income of NewIT from providing the computer programming services, because the income is Ron's personal services income.

          * Note: The amount included in your assessable income can be reduced by certain deductions to which the personal services entity is entitled: see section 8620.

    * (2) A **_personal services entity_** is a company, partnership or trust whose *ordinary income or *statutory income includes the *personal services income of one or more individuals.

    *  Exception: personal services businesses

    * (3) This section does not apply if that amount is income from the *personal services entity conducting a *personal services business.

          * Note: Even if the entity is conducting a personal services business, it is possible that some of its income is not income from conducting that business.

    *  Exception: amounts promptly paid to you as salary or wages

    * (4) This section does not apply to the extent that:

      * (a) the *personal services entity pays that amount to you, as an employee, as salary or wages; and

      * (b) the payment is made before the end of the 14th day after the *PAYG payment period during which the amount became *ordinary income or *statutory income of the entity.

          * Note: The entity is obliged to withhold amounts from salary or wages paid before the end of that day: see section 1235 in Schedule 1 to the _Taxation Administration Act 1953_.

    *  Exception: exempt income etc.

    * (5) This section only applies to the extent that that amount would be assessable income of the personal services entity if this Division did not apply.

          * Example: If the entity's income includes an amount that is your personal services income for a service on which GST is payable, the amount included in your assessable income will not include the GST, because the GST is neither assessable income nor exempt income of the entity: see section 175.

##### 8620  Offsetting the personal services entity's deductions against personal services income

    * (1) The amount of your *personal services income included in your assessable income under section 8615 may be reduced (but not below nil) by the amount of certain deductions to which the *personal services entity is entitled.

          * Note 1: Subdivision 86B limits a personal services entity's entitlement to deductions.

          * Note 2: If the amount of the deductions exceeds the amount of the personal services income, a deduction for the excess is available to you under section 8627. The personal services entity cannot deduct the amount of the excess: see section 8687.

    * (2) Use this method statement to work out whether, and by how much, the amount is reduced:

Method statement

        * Step 1.	Work out, for the income year, the amount of any deductions (other than *entity maintenance deductions or deductions for amounts of salary or wages paid to you) to which the *personal services entity is entitled that are deductions relating to your *personal services income.

        * Step 2.	Work out, for the income year, the amount of any *entity maintenance deductions to which the *personal services entity is entitled.

        * Step 3.	Work out the *personal services entity's assessable income for that income year, disregarding any income it receives that is your *personal services income or the personal services income of anyone else.

        * Step 4.	Subtract the amount under step 3 from the amount under step 2.

              * Note 1: Step 4 ensures that, before entity maintenance deductions can contribute to the reduction, they are first exhausted against any income of the entity that is not personal services income.

              * Note 2: If the personal services entity receives another individual's personal services income, see section 8625.

        * Step 5.	If the amount under step 4 is greater than zero, the amount of the reduction under subsection (1) is the sum of the amounts under steps 1 and 4.

        * Step 6_.	_If the amount under step 4 is not greater than zero, the amount of the reduction under subsection (1) is the amount under step 1.

          * Example 1: Continuing example 1 in section 845: Assume these additional facts:

            *  	$120,000 of NewIT's income is Ron's personal services income;

            *  	NewIT has deductions (including superannuation contributions) of $50,000 relating to Ron's personal services income (step 1);

            *  	NewIT has entity maintenance deductions of $8,000 (step 2);

            *  	NewIT has investments that produce income. NewIT's assessable income, disregarding Ron's or anyone else's personal services income, is $20,000 (step 3).

          * Because the step 4 amount is less than zero ($12,000), step 5 does not apply and, under step 6, the amount of the reduction is $50,000. Therefore the amount included in Ron's assessable income is:

          * Example 2: Assume, as an alternative set of facts, that NewIT's assessable income under step 3 was only $2,000.

          * The step 4 amount would have been $6,000, and, under step 5, the amount of the reduction would have been $56,000 (adding the amounts under steps 1 and 4). The amount included in Ron's assessable income would then have been:

          * Note: The personal services entity's deductions that do not relate to your personal services income and that are not entity maintenance deductions cannot reduce the amount included in your assessable income under section 8615.

##### 8625  Apportionment of entity maintenance deductions among several individuals

    * If, in the income year:

      * (a) the amount worked out under step 4 of the method statement in section 8620 is greater than zero; and

            * Note: This happens if the entity has entity maintenance deductions that form some or all of the reduction under section 8620.

      * (b) the *ordinary income or *statutory income of the *personal services entity includes another individual's *personal services income (as well as your personal services income); and

      * (c) the other individual's personal services income is included in the other individual's assessable income under section 8615;

    * the amount worked out under step 4 is taken to be: 

    * where: 

    * **_original step 4 amount_** is the amount that would be the amount worked out under step 4 if this section did not apply.

    * **_total personal services income_** is the sum of all the amounts of personal services income (whether your personal services income or someone else's) that are included in the personal services entity's ordinary income or statutory income for the income year.

    * **_your personal services income_** is the sum of all the amounts of your personal services income that are included in the personal services entity's ordinary income or statutory income for the income year.

          * Example: Continuing example 2 in section 8620: Assume that Robyn, another computer consultant, joined NewIT, and NewIT's ordinary income from providing the services also includes Robyn's personal services income of $168,000.

          * Because NewIT now receives the personal services income of someone else, Ron's step 4 amount is reduced as follows:

          * Under step 5 of the method statement in section 8620, the amount of the reduction under that section is therefore $52,500, and the amount included in Ron's assessable income is $67,500.

##### 8627  Deduction for net personal services income loss

    * If your personal services deduction amount exceeds your unreduced personal services income, then you can deduct the excess amount. For this purpose:

      * (a) your **_personal services deduction amount_** is the amount of deductions relating to your *personal services income worked out under step 1 of the method statement in section 8620, increased by the amount (if greater than zero) worked out under step 4 of the method statement; and

      * (b) your **_unreduced personal services income_** is the personal services income that would have been included in your assessable income for the income year if there had not been any reduction under section 8620.

##### 8630  Assessable income etc. of the personal services entity

    * *Ordinary income or *statutory income of the *personal services entity is neither assessable income nor *exempt income of the entity, to the extent that it is *personal services income included in your assessable income under section 8615.

          * Note: Subsection 11820(4) prevents this income being treated as a capital gain.

##### 8635  Later payments of, or entitlements to, personal services income to be disregarded for income tax purposes

    * (1) To the extent that a payment by the *personal services entity, or by your *associate, is a payment to you or any of your associates of:

      * (a) *personal services income included in your assessable income under section 8615; or

      * (b) any other amount that is attributable to that income;

    * the payment: 

      * (c) is neither assessable income nor *exempt income of the entity receiving it; and

            * Note: Subsection 11820(4) prevents this income being treated as a capital gain.

      * (d) is not an amount that the entity making it can deduct.

            * Note: Section 11865 prevents this amount being treated as a capital loss.

          * Example: Continuing example 2 in section 8620: Assume that NewIT had paid Jill, Ron's wife, an amount for work that is not the principal work of NewIT. The payment is made from money already included in Ron's assessable income under section 8615.

          * The amount is neither assessable income nor exempt income of Jill, and NewIT cannot deduct the amount.

    * (2) To the extent that you are entitled, or any of your *associates are entitled, to a share of the net income of the *personal services entity, or of any of your associates, and that income is:

      * (a) *personal services income included in your assessable income under section 8615; or

      * (b) any other amount that is attributable to that income;

    * that share is neither assessable income nor *exempt income of the entity receiving it or entitled to receive it.

##### 8640  Salary payments shortly after an income year

    * (1) If:

      * (a) before the end of 14 July in a particular income year, you receive, as salary or wages, *personal services income of yours from the *personal services entity; and

      * (b) failure to make the payment before the end of 14 July would have resulted in an amount of income being included in your assessable income under section 8615 for the preceding income year;

    * you are taken to have received the payment on 30 June of that preceding income year.

          * Example: Continuing example 2 in section 8620: Assume that NewIT is a small withholder for PAYG withholding purposes, and its PAYG payment period covering April 2001 to June 2001 is the quarter ending on 30 June 2001. NewIT's income for that period (after taking into account any reductions under sections 8620 and 8625) includes $20,000 that is Ron's personal services income, and NewIT pays this to Ron on 12 July 2001.

          * The $20,000 that Ron receives is assessable income for the income year ended on 30 June 2001.

    * (2) However, this section does not affect the time at which the *personal services entity is treated as having paid the salary or wages.

          * Note 1: Therefore neither the timing of the entity's deduction for the payment, nor the timing of the obligation to withhold amounts under section 1235 in Schedule 1 to the _Taxation Administration Act 1953_, is affected.

          * Note 2: However, these payments are treated as relating to the preceding income year for the purposes of the rules relating to payment summaries, PAYG credits and PAYG withholding noncompliance tax (see Subdivisions 16C, 18A and 18D in Schedule 1 to the _Taxation Administration Act 1953_).

       * 8685	Deduction entitlements of personal services entities for amounts included in an individual's assessable income

       * 8687	Personal services entity cannot deduct net personal services income loss

       * 8690	Application of Divisions 28 and 900 to personal services entities

##### 8660  General rule for deduction entitlements of personal services entities

    * A *personal services entity cannot deduct under this Act an amount to the extent that it relates to gaining or producing an individual's *personal services income, unless:

      * (a) the individual could have deducted the amount under this Act if the circumstances giving rise to the entity's entitlement to deduct the amount had applied instead to the individual; or

            * Note: In particular, Division 85 specifies limits on an individual's entitlements to deductions relating to the individual's personal services income.

      * (b) the entity receives the individual's *personal services income in the course of conducting a *personal services business.

##### 8665  Entity maintenance deductions

    * (1) Section 8660 does not stop a *personal services entity deducting an amount to the extent that it is an *entity maintenance deduction.

          * Note: See section 8625 for how entity maintenance deductions are offset against a personal services entity's income.

    * (2) Each of these is an **_entity maintenance deduction_**:

      * (a) any fee or charge payable by the entity for opening, operating or closing an account with an *ADI;

      * (b) any deduction under section 255 (about taxrelated expenses);

      * (c) any loss or outgoing incurred in relation to preparation or lodgment of any document the entity is required to lodge under the _Corporations Act 2001_;

      * (d) any fee or charge payable by the entity to an *Australian government agency for any licence, permission, approval, authorisation, registration or certification (however described) that is granted or given under an *Australian law.

    * (3) However, paragraph (2)(c) does not include any payment that the entity makes to an *associate.

##### 8670  Car expenses

    * Cars used solely for business

    * (1) Section 8660 does not stop a *personal services entity deducting a *car expense for a *car of which there is no *private use.

    * Other cars

    * (2) Section 8660 does not stop a *personal services entity deducting:

      * (a) a *car expense; or

      * (b) an amount of tax payable under the _Fringe Benefits Tax Assessment Act 1986_ for a *car fringe benefit;

    * for a *car of which there is *private use. However, there cannot be, at the same time, more than one car for which such deductions can arise in relation to gaining or producing the same individual's *personal services income.

    * (3) If there is more than one *car to which subsection (2) could apply at the same time, the entity must choose the car to which subsection (2) applies at that time. The choice remains in effect until the entity ceases to *hold that car.

          * Example: Continuing example 2 in section 8620: Assume that NewIT provides 3 cars to Ron. Car 1 is used solely for business purposes and cars 2 and 3 are used for private purposes.

          * NewIT can deduct all the car expenses it incurs for car 1. It can also deduct all the car expenses it incurs for its choice of either car 2 or car 3, as well as the fringe benefits tax it pays for that car. However, it cannot deduct any car expenses or fringe benefits tax for the car that it does not choose.

          * Note: If car expenses for a car are not deductible because of section 8660, the car benefit being provided is an exempt benefit for the purposes of fringe benefits tax: see subsection 8(4) of the _Fringe Benefits Tax Assessment Act 1986_.

##### 8675  Superannuation

    * (1) Section 8660 does not stop a *personal services entity deducting a contribution the entity makes to a fund or an *RSA for the purpose of making provision for *superannuation benefits payable for an individual whose *personal services income is included in the entity's *ordinary income or *statutory income.

          *  For deductions for superannuation contributions: see Subdivision AA of Division 3 of Part III of the _Income Tax Assessment Act 1936_.

    * (2) However, if:

      * (a) the individual performs less than 20% (by *market value) of the entity's principal work; and

      * (b) the individual is an *associate of another individual whose *personal services income is included in the entity's *ordinary income or *statutory income;

    * the entity's deduction cannot exceed the amount it would have to contribute, for the benefit of the individual, to a *complying superannuation fund or an *RSA in order to ensure that it did not have any *individual superannuation guarantee shortfalls in respect of the individual for any of the *quarters in the income year.

    * (3) To work out the amount the entity would have to contribute for the purposes of subsection (2), the individual's salary or wages, for the purposes of the _Superannuation Guarantee (Administration) Act 1992_, are taken to be the amount that section 8660 does not prevent the entity deducting for salary or wages it paid to the individual.

          * Note: Section 8660 will apply the limitations under sections 8510 and 8520 on an individual's entitlement to deductions (but see paragraph 8510(2)(e) on employment of associates).

##### 8680  Salary or wages promptly paid

    * Section 8660 does not stop a *personal services entity deducting an amount for salary or wages it pays to the individual referred to in that section before the end of the 14th day after the *PAYG payment period during which the amount became *ordinary income or *statutory income of the entity.

##### 8685  Deduction entitlements of personal services entities for amounts included in an individual's assessable income

    * The fact that a *personal services entity:

      * (a) incurs an amount in gaining or producing an individual's assessable income; or

      * (b) uses a *depreciating asset, or has it installed ready for use, for the *purpose of producing assessable income of an individual;

    * does not stop the entity deducting the loss or outgoing, or deducting an amount for the decline in value of the asset, under this Act if:

      * (c) the entity incurs the amount in gaining or producing, or uses or installs the depreciating asset for the purpose of producing, its *ordinary income or *statutory income; and

      * (d) the income is included in the individual's assessable income under section 8615.

##### 8687  Personal services entity cannot deduct net personal services income loss

    * The total amount of the deductions to which a *personal services entity is entitled for an income year is reduced by the amount of any deduction that an individual, whose *personal services income is ordinary or statutory income of the entity for that income year, is entitled to under section 8627.

##### 8690  Application of Divisions 28 and 900 to personal services entities

    * This Division does not have the effect of applying Division 28 (about car expenses) or Division 900 (about substantiation rules) to a *personal services entity.

          * Note: Divisions 28 and 900 can still apply to a personal services entity that is a partnership: see subsections 2810(2) and 9005(2).

##### Guide to Division 87

##### 871  What this Division is about

    * Divisions 85 and 86 do not apply to personal services income that is income from conducting a personal services business.

    * It is not intended that the Divisions apply to independent contractors.

    * A personal services business exists if there is a personal services business determination or if one or more of 4 tests for what is a personal services business are met.

    * Regardless of how much of your personal services income is paid from one source, you can selfassess against the results test to determine whether you are an independent contractor. The results test is based on the traditional tests for determining independent contractors and it is intended that it apply accordingly.

    * However, you cannot "selfassess" whether you meet any of the other 3 tests if 80% or more of your personal services income is from one source. In these cases, you need a personal services business determination in order to be treated as conducting a personal services business.

##### 8710  Object of this Division

    * The object of this Division is to define *personal services businesses in a way that ensures that it covers genuine businesses but not situations that are merely arrangements for dealing with the *personal services income of individuals.

##### 8715  What is a personal services business?

    * (1) An individual or *personal services entity conducts a **_personal services business_** if:

      * (a) for an individual--a *personal services business determination is in force relating to the individual's *personal services income; or

      * (b) for a personal services entity--a personal services business determination is in force relating to an individual whose personal services income is included in the entity's *ordinary income or *statutory income; or

      * (c) in any case--the individual or entity meets at least one of the 4 *personal services business tests in the income year for which the question whether the individual or entity is conducting a personal services business is in issue.

          * Note 1: For personal services business determinations, see Subdivision 87B.

          * Note 2: Under subsection (3), the personal services business tests, apart from the results test under section 8718, do not apply if 80% or more of your personal services income is from one source (but they can still be used in deciding whether to make a personal services business determination).

    * (2) The 4 **_personal services business tests_** are:

      * (a) the results test under section 8718; and

      * (b) the unrelated clients test under section 8720; and

      * (c) the employment test under section 8725; and

      * (d) the business premises test under section 8730.

    * (3) However, if 80% or more of an individual's *personal services income (not including income referred to in subsection (4)) during an income year is income from the same entity (or one entity and its *associates), and:

      * (a) the individual's personal services income is not included in a *personal services entity's *ordinary income or *statutory income during an income year, and the individual does not meet the results test under section 8718 in that income year; or

      * (b) the individual's personal services income is included in a personal services entity's ordinary income or statutory income during an income year, and the entity does not, in relation to the individual, meet the results test under section 8718 in that income year;

    * the individual's personal services income is _not_ taken to be from conducting a *personal services business unless:

      * (c) when the personal services income is gained or produced, a *personal services business determination is in force relating to the individual's personal services income; and

      * (d) if the determination was made on the application of a personal services entity--the individual's personal services income is income from the entity conducting the personal services business.

          * Note: Sections 8735 and 8740 affect the operation of subsection (3) in relation to Australian government agencies and certain agents.

    * (4) Subsection (3) does not apply to income:

      * (a) that the individual receives as an employee; or

      * (b) that the individual receives as an individual referred to in paragraph 1245(1)(a), (b), (c), (d) or (e) (payments to office holders) in Schedule 1 to the _Taxation Administration Act 1953_; or 

      * (c) to the extent that it is a payment referred to in section 1247 (payments to *religious practitioners) in that Schedule.

##### 8718  The results test for a personal services business

    * (1) An individual meets the results test in an income year if, in relation to at least 75% of the individual's *personal services income (not including income referred to in subsection (2)) during the income year:

      * (a) the income is for producing a result; and

      * (b) the individual is required to supply the *plant and equipment, or tools of trade, needed to perform the work from which the individual produces the result; and

      * (c) the individual is, or would be, liable for the cost of rectifying any defect in the work performed.

    * (2) Paragraph (1)(a) does not apply to income:

      * (a) that the individual receives as an employee; or

      * (b) that the individual receives as an individual referred to in paragraph 1245(1)(a), (b), (c), (d) or (e) (payments to office holders) in Schedule 1 to the _Taxation Administration Act 1953_; or

      * (c) to the extent that it is a payment referred to in section 1247 (payments to *religious practitioners) in that Schedule.

    * (3) A *personal services entity meets the results test in an income year if, in relation to at least 75% of the *personal services income of one or more individuals that is included in the personal services entity's *ordinary income or *statutory income during the income year:

      * (a) the income is for producing a result; and

      * (b) the personal services entity is required to supply the *plant and equipment, or tools of trade, needed to perform the work from which the personal services entity produces the result; and

      * (c) the personal services entity is, or would be, liable for the cost of rectifying any defect in the work performed.

    * (4) For the purposes of paragraph (1)(a), (b) or (c) or (3)(a), (b) or (c), regard is to be had to whether it is the custom or practice, when work of the kind in question is performed by an entity other than an employee:

      * (a) for the *personal services income from the work to be for producing a result; and

      * (b) for the entity to be required to supply the *plant and equipment, or tools of trade, needed to perform the work; and

      * (c) for the entity to be liable for the cost of rectifying any defect in the work performed;

    * as the case requires.

##### 8720  The unrelated clients test for a personal services business

    * (1) An individual or a *personal services entity meets the unrelated clients test in an income year if:

      * (a) during the year, the individual or personal services entity gains or produces income from providing services to 2 or more entities that are not *associates of each other, and are not associates of the individual or of the personal services entity; and

      * (b) the services are provided as a direct result of the individual or personal services entity making offers or invitations (for example, by advertising), to the public at large or to a section of the public, to provide the services.

          * Note: Sections 8735 and 8740 affect the operation of paragraph (1)(a) in relation to Australian government agencies and certain agents.

    * (2) The individual or *personal services entity is _not_ treated, for the purposes of paragraph (1)(b), as having made offers or invitations to provide services merely by being available to provide the services through an entity that conducts a *business of arranging for persons to provide services directly for clients of the entity.

##### 8725  The employment test for a personal services business

    * (1) An individual meets the employment test in an income year if:

      * (a) the individual engages one or more entities (other than *associates of the individual that are not individuals) to perform work; and

      * (b) that entity performs, or those entities together perform, at least 20% (by *market value) of the individual's principal work for that year.

    * (2) A *personal services entity meets the employment test in an income year if:

      * (a) the entity engages one or more other entities to perform work, other than:

        * (i) individuals whose *personal services income is included in the entity's *ordinary income or *statutory income; or

        * (ii) *associates of the entity that are not individuals; and

      * (b) that other entity performs, or those other entities together perform, at least 20% (by *market value) of the entity's principal work for that year.

    * (2A) If the *personal services entity is a partnership, work that a partner performs is taken, for the purposes of subsection (2), to be work that the personal services entity engages another entity to perform.

    * (3) An individual or a *personal services entity also meets the employment test in an income year if, for at least half the income year, the individual or entity has one or more apprentices.

##### 8730  The business premises test for a personal services business

    * (1) An individual or a *personal services entity meets the business premises test in an income year if, at all times during the income year, the individual or entity maintains and uses business premises:

      * (a) at which the individual or entity mainly conducts activities from which *personal services income is gained or produced; and

      * (b) of which the individual or entity has exclusive use; and

      * (c) that are physically separate from any premises that the individual or entity, or any *associate of the individual or entity, uses for private purposes; and

      * (d) that are physically separate from the premises of the entity to which the individual or entity provides services and from the premises of any associate of the entity to which the individual or entity provides services.

    * (2) The individual or entity need not maintain and use the same business premises throughout the income year.

##### 8735  Personal services income from Australian government agencies

    * (1) *Australian government agencies are not treated as *associates of each other for the purposes of subsection 8715(3) and paragraph 8720(1)(a).

          * Example: You receive 60% of your personal services income from a Department of a State government and 40% of your personal services income from a corporation in which that State has a majority shareholding.

          * You are not treated as if 80% or more of your personal services income is income from the same entity and that entity's associates, and therefore you will not need a personal services business determination to satisfy subsection 8715(3).

          * In addition, you satisfy the first limb (but not necessarily the second limb) of the unrelated clients test in subsection 8720(1), because you receive your personal services income from 2 entities that are not treated as associates of each other.

    * (2) Each Agency within the meaning of the _Public Service Act 1999_:

      * (a) is treated as a separate entity; and

      * (b) is not treated as an *associate of any other such Agency, or of any *Australian government agency;

    * for the purposes of subsection 8715(3) and paragraph 8720(1)(a).

          * Example: You receive 70% of your personal services income from the Commonwealth Department of Treasury and 30% of your personal services income from the Australian Taxation Office (neither body has a legal identity separate from the Commonwealth Government).

          * You are not treated as if 80% or more of your personal services income is income from the same entity, or from the same entity and that entity's associates, and therefore you will not need a personal services business determination to satisfy subsection 8715(3).

          * In addition, you satisfy the first limb (but not necessarily the second limb) of the unrelated clients test in subsection 8720(1), because you receive your personal services income from 2 bodies that are treated as separate entities and that are not treated as associates of each other.

    * (3) Each part of the government of a State or Territory, and each part of an authority of the State or Territory, that has, under a law of the State or Territory, a status corresponding to an Agency within the meaning of the _Public Service Act 1999_:

      * (a) is treated as a separate entity; and

      * (b) is not treated as an *associate of any other part of such a government or authority, or of any *Australian government agency;

    * for the purposes of subsection 8715(3) and paragraph 8720(1)(a).

##### 8740  Application of this Division to certain agents

      * (a) the individual or personal services entity is an *agent of another entity (the **_principal_**) but not the principal's employee; and

      * (b) the agent receives income from the principal that is for services that the agent provides to other entities (**_customers_**) on the principal's behalf; and

      * (c) at least 75% of that income is commissions, or fees, based on the agent's performance in providing services to the customers on the principal's behalf; and

      * (d) the agent actively seeks other entities to whom the agent could provide services on the principal's behalf; and

      * (e) the agent does not provide any services to the customers, on the principal's behalf, using premises:

        * (i) that the principal or an *associate of the principal owns; or

        * (ii) in which the principal or an associate of the principal has a leasehold interest;

      * unless the agent uses the premises under an arrangement entered into at *arm's length.

    * Whether personal services income is from one source

    * (3) If the *agent is an individual, in applying subsection 8715(3) to the *personal services income of the agent during an income year, any part of the agent's personal services income from the principal that:

      * (a) the agent gains or produces during the income year; and

      * (b) is for services that the agent provided to a customer on the principal's behalf in the income year or an earlier income year;

    * is treated as if it were personal services income from the customer, and not personal services income from the principal.

    * (4) If the *agent is a *personal services entity, in applying subsection 8715(3) to an individual's *personal services income that is included in the entity's *ordinary income or *statutory income during an income year, any part of the individual's personal services income from the principal that:

      * (a) the agent gains or produces during the income year; and

      * (b) is for services that the individual or the agent provided to a customer on the principal's behalf in the income year or an earlier income year;

    * is treated as if it were personal services income from the customer, and not personal services income from the principal.

    * The unrelated clients test for a personal services business

    * (5) In determining whether, during an income year, the *agent meets the unrelated clients test under section 8720, any services the agent provided in the income year or an earlier income year:

      * (a) for which the agent gains or produces, during the income year, personal services income from the principal; and

      * (b) that were provided to a customer on the principal's behalf;

    * are treated for the purposes of paragraph 8720(1)(a) as if the agent, and not the principal, provided them to the customer.

    * (5) For the purposes of measuring the 60 days mentioned in subsection (3), disregard each period (if any):

      * (a) starting on the day when the Commissioner requests the applicant under subsection (2) to give the Commissioner specified information or a specified document; and

      * (b) ending at the end of the day the applicant gives the Commissioner the specified information or document.

##### 8775  When personal services business determinations have effect

    * (1) The determination, or a variation of the determination, has effect, or is taken to have had effect, on and from:

      * (a) the day specified in the notice as the day on which the determination or variation takes effect, or took effect; or

      * (b) if a day is not specified--the day on which the notice is given.

    * (2) The determination ceases to have effect at the end of the earliest day on which one or more of these occurs:

      * (a) one or more conditions to which the determination is subject are not met;

      * (b) the Commissioner revokes the determination;

      * (c) the period for which the determination has effect comes to an end.

##### 8780  Revoking personal services business determinations

##### 8785  Review of decisions

    * A person who is dissatisfied with;

      * (a) a decision of the Commissioner to make, vary or revoke a *personal services business determination; or

      * (b) the Commissioner's refusal of an application for a personal services business determination or for a variation of a personal services business determination;

    * may object against the decision in the manner set out in Part IVC of the _Taxation Administration Act 1953_.

##### 1005  Effect of this Division

    * This Division is a *Guide.

          * Note: In interpreting an operative provision, a Guide may be considered only for limited purposes: see section 950150.

##### 10010  Fundamentals of CGT

    * (1) CGT affects your income tax liability because your assessable income includes your net capital gain for the income year. Your net capital gain is the total of your capital gains for the income year, reduced by certain capital losses you have made.

          * See later in this Guide (section 10050) for more detail.

    * (2) When you prepare your income tax return, you need to check whether you have made any capital gains for the income year.

    * You also need to check whether you have made any capital losses. You cannot deduct a capital loss from your assessable income, but it will reduce your capital gain in the current income year or later income years. 

    * (3) You will also need to consider the impact of CGT when doing your financial planning. In particular, you will need adequate recordkeeping to deal most effectively with any immediate or future CGT liability.

    * To give you a sense of the range of things affected by CGT, if you are involved with any of the following, you may have a CGT liability now or at some time in the future:

##### 10015  Overview of Steps 1 and 2

          * Note: Capital proceeds and cost base are not relevant for some CGT events, for example CGT event K7 or any of the CGT events created by Subdivision 104L.

##### Step 1--Have you made a capital gain or a capital loss?

##### 10020  What events attract CGT?

    * (1) You can make a capital gain or loss _only if_ a CGT event happens.

    * (2) There are a wide range of CGT events. Some happen often and affect many different taxpayers. Others are rare and affect only a few.

          * A summary of all the CGT events is in section 1045.

    * Identifying the time of a CGT event

    * (3) The specific time when a CGT event happens is important for various reasons: in particular, for working out whether a capital gain or loss from the event affects your income tax for the current or another income year.

    * If a CGT event involves a contract, the time of the event will often be when the contract is _made_, not when it is completed.

          * The time of each CGT event is explained early in
          * the relevant section in Division 104.


##### 10025  What are CGT assets?

    * (1) Most CGT events involve a CGT asset. (For many, there is an _exception_ if the CGT asset was acquired _before_ 20 September 1985.) However, many CGT events are concerned directly with capital receipts and do _not_ involve a CGT asset.

          * See the summary of the CGT events in section 1045.

    * (2) Some CGT assets are reasonably wellknown:

       *  	land and buildings, for example, a weekender;

       *  	shares;

       *  	units in a unit trust;

       *  	collectables which cost over $500, for example, jewellery or an artwork;

       *  	personal use assets which cost over $10,000, for example, a boat.

    * (3) Other CGT assets are not so wellknown. For example:

       *  	your home;

       *  	contractual rights;

       *  	goodwill;

       *  	foreign currency.

          *  For a full explanation of what things are CGT assets: see Division 108.

##### 10030  Does an exception or exemption apply?

    * (1) Once you identify a CGT event which applies to you, you need to know if there is an exception or exemption that would reduce the capital gain or loss or allow you to disregard it.

    * (2) There are 4 categories of exemptions:

      * 1.	exempt assets: for example, cars;

      * 2.	exempt or lossdenying transactions: for example, compensation for personal injury or your tenancy comes to an end;

      * 3.	antioverlap provisions (that reduce your capital gain by the amount that is otherwise assessable);

      * 4.	small business relief.

          * Note: Most of the exceptions are in Division 104. You will find most of the possible exemptions in Division 118. The small business relief provisions are in Division 152.

    * Some exemptions are limited

    * (3) Take the family home for example. Generally, you are exempt from CGT when you make a capital gain on disposing of your main residence.

    * But this can change depending on how you came to own the house and what you have done with it. For example, if you rent it out, you may be liable to CGT when you sell it.

          * 
          * For the limits on the general exemption of your main residence: see Subdivision 118B.


##### 10033  Can there be a rollover?

    * (1) Rollovers allow you to defer or disregard a capital gain or loss from a CGT event. They apply in specific situations. Some require a choice (for example, where an asset is compulsorily acquired: see Subdivision 124B) and some are automatic (for example, where an asset is transferred because of marriage or relationship breakdown: see Subdivision 126A).

    * (2) There are 2 types of rollover:

      * 1.	a _replacementasset rollover_ allows you to defer a capital gain or loss from one CGT event until a later CGT event happens where a CGT asset is replaced with another one;

      * 2.	a _sameasset rollover _allows you to disregard a capital gain or loss from a CGT event where the same CGT asset is involved.

          * Note: The replacementasset rollovers are listed in section 112115, and the sameasset rollovers are listed in section 112150.

##### Step 2--Work out the amount of the capital gain or loss

##### 10035  What is a capital gain or loss?

    * For most CGT events: 

       *  	You make a capital gain if you receive (or are entitled to receive) capital amounts from the CGT event which exceed your total costs associated with that event.

       *  	You make a capital loss if your total costs associated with the CGT event exceed the capital amounts you receive (or are entitled to receive) from the event.

##### 10040  What factors come into calculating a capital gain or loss?

    * Capital proceeds

    * (1) For most CGT events, the capital amounts you receive (or are entitled to receive) from the event are called the **_capital proceeds_**.

          *  To work out the capital proceeds: see Division 116.

    * Cost base and reduced cost base

    * (2) For most CGT events, your total costs associated with the event are worked out in 2 different ways:

       *  	For the purpose of working out a capital _gain_, those costs are called the **_cost base_** of the CGT asset.

       *  	For the purpose of working out a capital _loss_, those costs are called the **_reduced cost base_** of the asset.

    * One of the main differences is that the costs may be indexed for inflation occurring before 1 October 1999 in working out a capital _gain_ for a CGT asset acquired at or before 11.45 am on 21 September 1999 (which reduces the size of the gain), but not in working out a capital _loss_.

          *  To work out the cost base and reduced cost base: see Division 110.

##### 10045  How to calculate the capital gain or loss for most CGT events

    * 1.	Work out your capital proceeds from the CGT event.

    * 2.	Work out the cost base for the CGT asset.

    * 3.	Subtract the cost base from the capital proceeds.

    * 4.	If the proceeds exceed the cost base, the difference is your capital _gain_.

    * 5.	If not, work out the reduced cost base for the asset.

    * 6.	If the reduced cost base exceeds the capital proceeds, the difference is your capital _loss_.

    * 7.	If the capital proceeds are less than the cost base but more than the reduced cost base, you have neither a capital _gain_ nor a capital _loss_.

##### Step 3--Work out your net capital gain or loss for the income year

##### 10050  How to work out your net capital gain or loss

    * 1.	Reduce your capital gains for the income year, in the order you choose, by your capital losses for the income year. (If the capital losses for the income year exceed the capital gains, the difference is your net capital loss. You cannot deduct a net capital loss from your assessable income.)

    * 2.	Reduce any remaining capital gains, in the order you choose, by any unapplied net capital losses for previous income years.

    * 3.	Reduce any remaining discount capital gains by the discount percentage.

          * 
          * To find out what is a discount capital gain and the discount percentage: see Division 115.


    * 4.	If you carry on a small business, apply the small business concessions in further reduction of your capital gains (whether or not the gains are discount capital gains).

          * 
          * For the small business concessions: see Division 152.


    * 5.	Add up:

      * (a) any remaining capital gains that are not discount capital gains; and

      * (b) any remaining discount capital gains.

    * The total is your net capital gain.

          * For the rules on working out your _net_ capital gain or loss:
          * see Division 102.


##### 10055  How do you comply with CGT?

    * Declare any net capital gain as assessable income in your income tax return.

    * Defer any net capital loss to the next income year for which you have capital gains that exceed the capital losses for that income year.

##### Keeping records for CGT purposes

##### 10060  Why keep records?

    * 1.	To ensure you do not disadvantage yourself.

    * 2.	To comply as easily as possible.

    * 3.	To plan for your CGT position in future income years.

    * 4.	The law requires you to: see Division 121.

##### 10065  What records?

    * Keeping full records will make it easier for you to comply. For example, keep records of:

       *  	receipts of purchase or transfer;

       *  	interest on money you borrowed;

       *  	costs of agents, accountants, legal, advertising etc.;

       *  	insurance costs and land rates or taxes;

       *  	any market valuations;

       *  	costs of maintenance, repairs or modifications;

       *  	brokerage on shares;

       *  	legal costs.

##### 10070  How long you need to keep records

    * The law requires you to keep records for 5 years after a CGT event has happened.

#### Division 102--Assessable income includes net capital gain

##### Guide to Division 102

##### 1021  What this Division is about

    * This Division tells you how to work out if you have made a net capital gain or a net capital loss for the income year. A net capital gain is included in your assessable income. However, you cannot deduct a net capital loss. (Amounts otherwise included in your assessable income do not form part of a net capital gain.)

##### 1023  Concessions in working out your net capital gain

    * (1) Concessional rules apply to working out the net capital gain of some entities (see subsection (2)) if:

      * (a) they have a capital gain (a **_discount capital gain_**) from a CGT asset acquired at least 12 months before the CGT event that caused the capital gain; and

      * (b) they have not chosen to include indexation in the cost base of the asset for working out the capital gain (if relevant).

          * Note 1: Division 115 explains what is a discount capital gain.

          * Note 2: Under Division 110, the entity can choose to include indexation in the cost base of a CGT asset acquired at or before 11.45 am on 21 September 1999.

    * (2) Only these entities get the concession:

      * (a) individuals;

      * (b) complying superannuation entities;

      * (c) trusts;

      * (d) life insurance companies, in relation to discount capital gains for CGT events in respect of CGT assets that are complying superannuation/FHSA assets.

          * Note: Shareholders in a listed investment company can also receive a concession equivalent to a discount capital gain: see Subdivision 115D.

    * (3) The concession is that the net capital gain includes only _part_ of the amount of the discount capital gain left after applying capital losses and net capital losses from earlier income years.

          * See subsection 1025(1).

##### Operative provisions

##### 1025  Assessable income includes net capital gain

    * (1) Your assessable income includes your net capital gain (if any) for the income year. You work out your **_net capital gain_** in this way:

Working out your net capital gain

        * Step 1.	Reduce the *capital gains you made during the income year by the *capital losses (if any) you made during the income year.

              * Note 1: You choose the order in which you reduce your capital gains. You have a net capital loss for the income year if your capital losses exceed your capital gains: see section 10210.

              * Note 2: Some provisions of this Act (such as Divisions 104 and 118) permit or require you to disregard certain capital gains or losses when working out your net capital gain. Subdivision 152B permits you, in some circumstances, to disregard a capital gain on an asset you held for at least 15 years.

        * Step 2.	Apply any previously unapplied *net capital losses from earlier income years to reduce the amounts (if any) remaining after the reduction of *capital gains under step 1 (including any capital gains not reduced under that step because the *capital losses were less than the total of your capital gains).

              * Note 1: Section 10215 explains how to apply net capital losses.

              * Note 2: You choose the order in which you reduce the amounts.

        * Step 3.	Reduce by the *discount percentage each amount of a *discount capital gain remaining after step 2 (if any).

              * Note: Only some entities can have discount capital gains, and only if they have capital gains from CGT assets acquired at least a year before making the gains. See Division 115.

        * Step 4.	If any of your *capital gains (whether or not they are *discount capital gains) qualify for any of the small business concessions in Subdivisions 152C, 152D and 152E, apply those concessions to each capital gain as provided for in those Subdivisions.

              * Note 1: The basic conditions for getting these concessions are in Subdivision 152A.

              * Note 2: Subdivision 152C does not apply to CGT events J2, J5 and J6. In addition, Subdivision 152E does not apply to CGT events J5 and J6.

        * Step 5.	Add up the amounts of *capital gains (if any) remaining after step 4. The sum is your **_net capital gain_** for the income year.

          * Note: For exceptions and modifications to these rules: see section 10230.

    * (2) However, if during the income year:

      * (a) you became bankrupt; or

      * (b) you were released from debts under a law relating to bankruptcy;

    * any *net capital loss you made for an earlier income year must be disregarded in working out whether you made a *net capital gain for the income year or a later one.

    * (3) Subsection (2) applies even though your bankruptcy is annulled if:

      * (a) the annulment happens under section 74 of the _Bankruptcy Act 1966_; and

      * (b) under the composition or scheme of arrangement concerned, you were, will be or may be released from debts from which you would have been released if instead you had been discharged from the bankruptcy.

##### 10210  How to work out your net capital loss

    * (1) You work out if you have a **_net capital loss _**for the income year in this way:

    * Working out your net capital loss

        * Step 1.	Add up the *capital losses you made during the income year. Also add up the *capital gains you made.

        * Step 2.	Subtract your *capital gains from your *capital losses.

        * Step 3.	If the Step 2 amount is _more than_ zero, it is your **_net capital loss _**for the income year.

          * Note: For exceptions and modifications to these rules: see section 10230.

    * (2) You _cannot _deduct from your assessable income a *net capital loss for any income year.

##### 10215  How to apply net capital losses

    * In working out if you have a *net capital gain, your *net capital losses are applied in the order in which you made them.

          * Note 1: A net capital loss can be applied only to the extent that it has not already been utilised: see subsection 96020(1).

          * Note 2: For applying a net capital loss for the 199798 income year or an earlier income year, see section 10215 of the _Income Tax (Transitional Provisions) Act 1997_.

##### 10220  Ways you can make a capital gain or a capital loss

    * You can make a *capital gain or *capital loss if and only if a *CGT event happens. The gain or loss is made at the time of the event.

          * Note 1: The full list of CGT events is in section 1045.

          * Note 2: The gain or loss may be affected by an exemption, or may be able to be rolledover. For exemptions generally, see Division 118. For rollovers, see Divisions 122, 123, 124 and 126.

          * Note 3: You may make a capital gain or capital loss as a result of a CGT event happening to another entity: see subsections 115215(3), 170275(1) and 170280(3).

          * Note 4: You cannot make a capital loss from a CGT event that happens to your original interests during a trust restructuring period if you choose a rollover under Subdivision 124N.

          * Note 5: The capital loss may be affected if the CGT asset was owned by a member of a demerger group just before a demerger: see section 125170.

          * Note 6: Under subsection 230310(4) gains and losses are taken to arise from a CGT event in particular circumstances.

##### 10222  Amounts of capital gains and losses

    * Most *CGT events provide for calculating a *capital gain or *capital loss by comparing 2 different amounts. The amount of the gain or loss is the difference between those amounts.

##### 10223  CGT event still happens even if gain or loss disregarded

    * A *CGT event still happens even if:

      * (a) it does not result in a *capital gain or *capital loss; or

      * (b) a capital gain or capital loss from the event is disregarded.

          * Example: Lindy sells a car. Section 1185 says that any capital gain or loss from a CGT event happening to a car is disregarded. However, the sale is still an example of CGT event A1.

##### 10225  Order of application of CGT events

    * (1) Work out if a *CGT event (except *CGT events D1 and H2) happens to your situation. If more than one event can happen, the one you use is the one that is the most specific to your situation.

    * (2) However, there are 3 exceptions: one for *CGT event J2, one for CGT event K5 and one for CGT event K12.

    * (2A) If the circumstances that gave rise to *CGT event J2 constitute another CGT event, CGT event J2 applies in addition to the other event.

          * Example: CGT event J2 happens because a replacement asset for a small business rollover under Subdivision 152E becomes your trading stock (in circumstances where CGT event K4 happens). Both CGT events apply.

    * (2B) *CGT event K5 happens if CGT event A1, C2 or E8 happens. CGT event K5 applies in addition to the other event.

    * (2C) If:

      * (a) *CGT events happen for which you make *capital gains or *capital losses; and

      * (b) the capital gains or losses are taken into account in working out a *foreign hybrid net capital loss amount; and

      * (c) the foreign hybrid net capital loss amount is itself taken into account in determining that *CGT event K12 happens;

    * CGT event K12 applies in addition to the other CGT events.

    * (3) If no *CGT event (except *CGT events D1 and H2) happens:

      * (a) work out if CGT event D1 happens and use that event if it does; and

      * (b) if it does not, work out if CGT event H2 happens and use that event if it does.

          * Note: The full list of CGT events is in section 1045.

##### 10230  Exceptions and modifications

    * Provisions of this Act are in normal text. The other provisions, **in bold**, are provisions of the _Income Tax Assessment Act 1936_.

#### Division 103--General rules

##### Guide to Division 103

##### 1031  What this Division is about

    * This Division sets out some general rules that apply to the provisions dealing with capital gains and capital losses.

##### Table of sections

  * Operative provisions

       * 1035	Giving property as part of a transaction

       * 10310	Entitlement to receive money or property

       * 10330	Reduction of cost base etc. by net input tax credits

##### Operative provisions

##### 1035  Giving property as part of a transaction

    * There are a number of provisions in this Part and Part 33 that say that a payment, cost or expenditure can include giving property.

    * To the extent that such a provision does say that a payment, cost or expenditure can include giving property, use the *market value of the property in working out the amount of the payment, cost or expenditure.

##### 10310  Entitlement to receive money or property

    * (1) This Part and Part 33 apply to you as if you had received money or other property if it has been applied for your benefit (including by discharging all or part of a debt you owe) or as you direct.

    * (2) Those Parts apply to you as if you are entitled to receive money or other property:

      * (a) if you are entitled to have it so applied; or

      * (b) if:

        * (i) you will not receive it until a later time; or

        * (ii) the money is payable by instalments.

##### 10315  Requirement to pay money or give property

    * This Part and Part 33 apply to you as if you are required to pay money or give other property even if: 

      * (a) you do not have to pay or give it until a later time; or

      * (b) the money is payable by instalments.

##### 10325  Choices

    * (1) A choice you can make under this Part or Part 33 must be made:

      * (a) by the day you lodge your *income tax return for the income year in which the relevant *CGT event happened; or

      * (b) within a further time allowed by the Commissioner.

    * (2) The way you (and any other entity making the choice) prepare your *income tax returns is sufficient evidence of the making of the choice.

    * (3) However, there are some exceptions:

      * (aa) subsection 115230(3) (relating to assessment of *capital gains of resident testamentary trusts) requires a trustee to make a choice by the time specified in subsection 115230(5); and

      * (b) subsections 152315(4) and (5) (relating to the small business retirement exemption) require a choice to be made in writing.

          * Note: This section is modified in calculating the attributable income of a CFC: see section 421 of the _Income Tax Assessment Act 1936_.

##### 10330  Reduction of cost base etc. by net input tax credits

    * Reduce the *cost base and *reduced cost base of a *CGT asset, and any other amount that could be involved in the calculation of an entity's *capital gain or *capital loss, by the amount of any *net input tax credit of the entity in relation to that amount.

          * Example: The other amount could be expenditure in the case of some CGT events (see, for example, CGT event D1).

          * Note: Subsection 11620(5) deals with the effect of net GST on supplies for the purposes of capital proceeds.

##### Guide to Division 104

##### 1041  What this Division is about

    * This Division sets out all the CGT events for which you can make a capital gain or loss. It tells you how to work out if you have made a gain or loss from each event and the time of each event. It also contains exceptions for gains and losses for many events (such as the exception for CGT assets acquired before 20 September 1985) and some cost base adjustment rules.

##### 1045  Summary of the CGT events

          * Note: Subsection 230310(4) (which deals with hedging financial arrangements) provides that in certain circumstances a CGT event is taken to have occurred in relation to a hedging financial arrangement at the same time as a CGT event actually occurs in relation to a hedged item covered by the arrangement.

##### Subdivision 104A--Disposals

##### 10410  Disposal of a CGT asset: CGT event A1

    * (1) **_CGT event A1_** happens if you *dispose of a *CGT asset.

    * (2) You **_dispose of_** a *CGT asset if a change of ownership occurs from you to another entity, whether because of some act or event or by operation of law. However, a change of ownership does not occur if you stop being the legal owner of the asset but continue to be its beneficial owner.

          * Note: A change in the trustee of a trust does not constitute a change in the entity that is the trustee of the trust (see subsection 960100(2)). This means that CGT event A1 will not happen merely because of a change in the trustee.

    * (3) The time of the event is:

      * (a) when you enter into the contract for the *disposal; or

      * (b) if there is no contract--when the change of ownership occurs.

          * Example: In June 1999 you enter into a contract to sell land. The contract is settled in October 1999. You make a capital gain of $50,000.

          * The gain is made in the 199899 income year (the year you entered into the contract) and not the 19992000 income year (the year that settlement takes place).

          * Note 1: If the contract falls through before completion, this event does not happen because no change in ownership occurs.

          * Note 2: If the asset was compulsorily acquired from you: see subsection (6).

    * (4) You make a **_capital gain_** if the *capital proceeds from the disposal are _more_ than the asset's *cost base. You make a **_capital loss_** if those capital proceeds are _less_ than the asset's *reduced cost base.

    * Exceptions

    * (5) A *capital gain or *capital loss you make is disregarded if:

      * (a) you *acquired the asset before 20 September 1985; or

      * (b) for a lease that you granted:

        * (i) it was granted before that day; or

        * (ii) if it has been renewed or extended--the start of the last renewal or extension occurred before that day.

          * Note 1: You can make a gain if you dispose of shares in a company, or an interest in a trust, that you acquired before that day: see CGT event K6.

          * Note 2: A capital gain or loss you make because you assign a right under or in relation to a general insurance policy you held with an HIH company to the Commonwealth, the trustee of the HIH Trust or a prescribed entity is also disregarded: see section 32215.

          * Note 3: A capital gain or loss made by a demerging entity from CGT event A1 happening as a result of a demerger is also disregarded: see section 125155.

          * Note 4: A capital gain or loss you make because of section 16AI of the _Banking Act 1959_ is disregarded: see section 25310 of this Act. Section 16AI of the _Banking Act 1959_:

            * (a) reduces your right to be paid an amount by an ADI in connection with an account to the extent of your entitlement under Division 2AA of Part II of that Act to be paid an amount by APRA; and

            * (b) provides that, to the extent of the reduction, the right becomes a right of APRA.

          * Note 5: A capital gain or loss you make because, under section 62ZZL of the _Insurance Act 1973_, you dispose of a CGT asset consisting of your rights against a general insurance company to APRA is disregarded: see section 32230 of this Act.

    * Compulsory acquisition

    * (6) If the asset was *acquired from you by an entity under a power of compulsory acquisition conferred by an *Australian law or a *foreign law, the time of the event is the earliest of:

      * (a) when you received compensation from the entity; or

      * (b) when the entity became the asset's owner; or

      * (c) when the entity entered it under that power; or

      * (d) when the entity took possession under that power.

          * Note: You may be able to choose a rollover if an asset is compulsorily acquired: see Subdivision 124B.

##### Subdivision 104B--Use and enjoyment before title passes

##### 10415  Use and enjoyment before title passes: CGT event B1

    * (1) **_CGT event B1_** happens if you enter into an agreement with another entity under which:

      * (a) the right to the use and enjoyment of a *CGT asset you own passes to the other entity; and

      * (b) title in the asset will or may pass to the other entity at or before the end of the agreement.

          * Note: Division 240 provides for the inclusion of amounts under hire purchase agreements in assessable income.

    * (2) The time of the event is when the other entity first obtains the use and enjoyment of the asset.

    * (3) You make a **_capital gain_** if the *capital proceeds from the agreement are _more_ than the asset's *cost base. You make a **_capital loss_** if those capital proceeds are _less_ than the asset's *reduced cost base.

    * Exceptions

    * (4) A *capital gain or *capital loss you make is disregarded if:

      * (a) title in the asset does not pass to the other entity at or before the end of the agreement; or

      * (b) you *acquired the asset before 20 September 1985.

          * Note: This event can apply to part of a CGT asset: see section 1085 (definition of **_CGT asset_**).

    * (2) The time of the event is:

      * (a) when you first receive compensation for the loss or destruction; or

      * (b) if you receive no compensation--when the loss is discovered or the destruction occurred.

    * (3) You make a **_capital gain_** if the *capital proceeds from the loss or destruction are _more_ than the asset's *cost base. You make a **_capital loss_** if those capital proceeds are _less_ than the asset's *reduced cost base.

    * Exception

    * (4) A *capital gain or *capital loss you make is disregarded if you *acquired the asset before 20 September 1985.

##### 10425  Cancellation, surrender and similar endings: CGT event C2

    * (1) **_CGT event C2_** happens if your ownership of an intangible *CGT asset ends by the asset:

      * (a) being redeemed or cancelled; or

      * (b) being released, discharged or satisfied; or

      * (c) expiring; or

      * (d) being abandoned, surrendered or forfeited; or

      * (e) if the asset is an option--being exercised; or

      * (f) if the asset is a *convertible interest--being converted.

    * (2) The time of the event is:

      * (a) when you enter into the contract that results in the asset ending; or

      * (b) if there is no contract--when the asset ends.

    * (3) You make a **_capital gain_** if the *capital proceeds from the ending are _more_ than the asset's *cost base. You make a **_capital loss_** if those capital proceeds are _less_ than the asset's *reduced cost base.

          * Note: The capital proceeds referred to in this subsection are reduced if the gain or loss was for shares and an amount was taken into account as a capital gain for the shares under former section 160ZL of the _Income Tax Assessment Act 1936_ for the 199798 income year or an earlier income year: see section 10425 of the _Income Tax (Transitional Provisions) Act 1997_.

    * (4) A lease is taken to have expired even if it is extended or renewed.

    * Exceptions

    * (5) A *capital gain or *capital loss you make is disregarded if:

      * (a) you *acquired the asset before 20 September 1985; or

      * (b) for a lease that you granted:

        * (i) it was granted before that day; or

        * (ii) if it has been renewed or extended--the start of the last renewal or extension occurred before that day.

          * Note 1: There are other exceptions if:

            *  	 your lease expires and you did not use it mainly to produce assessable income: see section 11840; or

            *  	 you exercise rights to acquire shares or units: see section 13040; or

            *  	 you acquire shares or units by converting a convertible interest: see section 13060; or

            *  	 you exercise an option: see section 1341.

          * Note 2: A company can agree to forgo any capital loss it makes as a result of forgiving a commercial debt owed to it by another company where the companies are under common ownership: see section 24590.

          * Note 3: A capital gain or loss a company makes because shares in its 100% subsidiary are cancelled (an example of CGT event C2) on the liquidation of the subsidiary may be reduced if there was a rollover for a CGT asset under Subdivision 126B: see section 12685.

          * Note 4: A capital gain on the repayment of certain debt given to an ultimate holding company is disregarded where an entity obtains a rollover under Subdivision 124M for interests acquired or cancelled: see section 124784.

          * Note 5: Cost base adjustments are made only under Subdivision 125B if there is a rollover under that Subdivision for CGT event C2 happening as a result of a demerger.

          * Note 6: A capital gain or loss made by a demerging entity from CGT event C2 happening as a result of a demerger is also disregarded: see section 125155.

##### 10430  End of option to acquire shares etc.: CGT event C3

    * (1) **_CGT event C3_** happens if an option a company or a trustee of a unit trust granted to an entity to *acquire a *CGT asset that is:

      * (a) *shares in the company or units in the unit trust; or

      * (b) *debentures of the company or unit trust;

    * ends in one of these ways: 

      * (c) it is not exercised by the latest time for its exercise;

      * (d) it is cancelled;

      * (e) it is released or abandoned.

    * (2) The time of the event is when the option ends.

    * (3) The company or trustee makes a **_capital gain_** if the *capital proceeds from the grant of the option are _more_ than the expenditure incurred in granting it. It makes a **_capital loss_** if those capital proceeds are _less_.

    * (4) The expenditure can include giving property: see section 1035. However, it does not include an amount you have received as *recoupment of it and that is not included in your assessable income.

    * Exception

##### Subdivision 104D--Bringing into existence a CGT asset

##### Table of sections

       *  10435	Creating contractual or other rights: CGT event D1

       *  10440	Granting an option: CGT event D2

       *  10445	Granting a right to income from mining: CGT event D3

       *  10447	Conservation covenants: CGT event D4

##### 10435  Creating contractual or other rights: CGT event D1

    * (1) **_CGT event D1 _**happens if you create a contractual right or other legal or equitable right in another entity.

          * Example: You enter into a contract with the purchaser of your business not to operate a similar business in the same town. The contract states that $20,000 was paid for this.

          * You have created a contractual right in favour of the purchaser. If you breach the contract, the purchaser can enforce that right.

    * (2) The time of the event is when you enter into the contract or create the other right.

    * (3) You make a **_capital gain_** if the *capital proceeds from creating the right are _more_ than the *incidental costs you incurred that relate to the event. You make a **_capital loss_** if those capital proceeds are _less_.

          * Example: To continue the example: If you paid your lawyer $1,500 to draw up the contract, you make a capital gain of:

    * (4) The costs can include giving property: see section 1035. However, they do not include an amount you have received as *recoupment of them and that is not included in your assessable income, or an amount to the extent that you have deducted or can deduct it.

    * Exceptions

    * (5) **_CGT event D1_** does not happen if:

      * (a) you created the right by borrowing money or obtaining credit from another entity; or

      * (b) the right requires you to do something that is another *CGT event that happens to you; or

      * (c) a company issues or allots *equity interests or *nonequity shares in the company; or

      * (d) the trustee of a unit trust issues units in the trust; or 

      * (e) a company grants an option to acquire equity interests, nonequity shares or *debentures in the company; or

      * (f) the trustee of a unit trust grants an option to acquire units or debentures in the trust.

          * Example: You agree to sell land. You have created a contractual right in the buyer to enforce completion of the transaction. The sale results in you disposing of the land, an example of CGT event A1. This means that CGT event D1 does not happen.

##### 10440  Granting an option: CGT event D2

    * (1) **_CGT event D2_** happens if you grant an option to an entity, or renew or extend an option you had granted.

          * Note: Some options are not covered: see subsections (6) and (7).

    * (2) The time of the event is when you grant, renew or extend the option.

    * (3) You make a **_capital gain_** if the *capital proceeds from the grant, renewal or extension of the option are _more_ than the expenditure you incurred to grant, renew or extend it. You make a **_capital loss_** if those capital proceeds are _less_.

    * (4) The expenditure can include giving property: see section 1035. However, it does not include an amount you have received as *recoupment of it and that is not included in your assessable income, or an amount to the extent that you have deducted or can deduct it.

    * Exceptions

    * (5) A *capital gain or *capital loss you make from the grant, renewal or extension of the option is disregarded if the option is exercised.

          * Note 1: Section 1341 sets out the consequences of an option being exercised.

          * Note 2: A capital gain or capital loss you made for the 199798 income year or an earlier income year under former Part IIIA of the _Income Tax Assessment Act 1936 _is also disregarded where the option is exercised in the 199899 income year or a later one: see section 10440 of the _Income Tax (Transitional Provisions) Act 1997_.

    * (6) This section does not apply to an option granted, renewed or extended by a company or the trustee of a unit trust to *acquire a *CGT asset that is:

      * (a) *shares in the company or units in the unit trust; or

      * (b) debentures of the company or unit trust.

          * Note: Section 10430 deals with this situation.

    * (7) Nor does it apply to an option relating to a *personal use asset or a *collectable.

##### 10445  Granting a right to income from mining: CGT event D3

    * (1) **_CGT event D3_** happens if you own a *prospecting entitlement or *mining entitlement, or an interest in one, and you grant another entity a right to receive *ordinary income or *statutory income from operations permitted to be carried on by the entitlement.

          * Note: If this event applies, there is no disposal of the entitlement.

    * (2) The time of the event is:

      * (a) when you enter into the contract with the other entity; or

      * (b) if there is no contract--when you grant the right to receive *ordinary income or *statutory income.

    * (3) You make a **_capital gain_** if the *capital proceeds from the grant of the right are _more_ than the expenditure you incurred in granting it. You make a **_capital loss_** if those capital proceeds are _less_.

    * (4) The expenditure can include giving property: see section 1035. However, it does not include an amount you have received as *recoupment of it and that is not included in your assessable income, or an amount to the extent that you have deducted or can deduct it.

##### 10447  Conservation covenants: CGT event D4

    * (1) **_CGT event D4_** happens if you enter into a *conservation covenant over land you own.

    * (2) The time of the event is when you enter into the covenant.

    * (3) You make a *capital gain if the *capital proceeds from entering into the covenant are _more_ than that part of the *cost base of the land that is apportioned to the covenant. You make a *capital loss if those capital proceeds are _less_ than the part of the *reduced cost base of the land that is apportioned to the covenant.

          * Note: The capital proceeds from entering into the covenant are modified if you do not receive anything for entering into the covenant: see section 116105.

    * (4) The part of the *cost base of the land that is apportioned to the covenant is worked out in this way:

    * The part of the *reduced cost base of the land that is apportioned to the covenant is worked out similarly.

    * (5) The *cost base and *reduced cost base of the land are reduced by the part of the cost base or reduced cost base of the land that is apportioned to the covenant.

          * Example: Lisa receives $10,000 for entering into a conservation covenant that covers 15% of the land she owns. Lisa uses the following figures in calculating the cost base of the land that is apportioned to the covenant:

          * The cost base of the entire land is $200,000.

          * The market value of the entire land before entering into the covenant is $300,000, and its market value after entering into the covenant is $285,000.

          * Lisa calculates the cost base of the land that is apportioned to the covenant to be: 

         * She reduces the cost base of the land by the part that is apportioned to the covenant: 

    * Exceptions

    * (6) *CGT event D4 does not happen if:

      * (a) you did not receive any *capital proceeds for entering into the covenant; and

      * (b) you cannot deduct an amount under Division 31 for entering into the covenant.

          * Note: In this case, CGT event D1 will apply.

    * (7) A *capital gain or *capital loss you make is disregarded if you *acquired the land before 20 September 1985.

    * (1) **_CGT event E1_** happens if you create a trust over a *CGT asset by declaration or settlement.

          * Note: A change in the trustee of a trust does not constitute a change in the entity that is the trustee of the trust (see subsection 960100(2)). This means that CGT event E1 will not happen merely because of a change in the trustee.

    * (2) The time of the event is when the trust over the asset is created.

    * (3) You make a **_capital gain_** if the *capital proceeds from the creation are _more_ than the asset's *cost base. You make a **_capital loss_** if those capital proceeds are _less_ than the asset's *reduced cost base.

    * Cost base rule

    * (4) If you are the trustee of the trust and no beneficiary is absolutely entitled to the asset as against you (disregarding any legal disability), the first element of the asset's *cost base and *reduced cost base in your hands is its *market value when the trust is created.

##### 10460  Transferring a CGT asset to a trust: CGT event E2

    * (1) **_CGT event E2_** happens if you transfer a *CGT asset to an existing trust.

          * Note: A change in the trustee of a trust does not constitute a change in the entity that is the trustee of the trust (see subsection 960100(2)). This means that CGT event E2 will not happen merely because of a change in the trustee.

    * (2) The time of the event is when the asset is transferred.

    * (3) You make a **_capital gain_** if the *capital proceeds from the transfer are _more_ than the asset's *cost base. You make a **_capital loss_** if those capital proceeds are _less_ than the asset's *reduced cost base.

    * (4) If you are the trustee of the trust and no beneficiary is absolutely entitled to the asset as against you (disregarding any legal disability), the first element of the asset's *cost base and *reduced cost base in your hands is its *market value when the asset is transferred.

##### 10465  Converting a trust to a unit trust: CGT event E3

    * (1) **_CGT event E3 _**happens if:

      * (a) a trust (that is not a unit trust) over a *CGT asset is converted to a unit trust; and

      * (b) just before the conversion, a beneficiary under the trust was absolutely entitled to the asset as against the trustee (disregarding any legal disability the beneficiary is under).

    * (2) The time of the event is when the trust is converted.

    * (3) The beneficiary makes a **_capital gain_** if the *market value of the asset (when the trust is converted) is _more_ than the asset's *cost base. The beneficiary makes a **_capital loss_** if that market value is _less_ than the asset's *reduced cost base.

    * Exception

    * (4) A *capital gain or *capital loss the beneficiary makes is disregarded if it *acquired the asset before 20 September 1985.

##### 10470  Capital payment for trust interest: CGT event E4

    * (1) **_CGT event E4_** happens if:

      * (a) the trustee of a trust makes a payment to you in respect of your unit or your interest in the trust (except for *CGT event A1, C2, E1, E2, E6 or E7 happening in relation to it); and

      * (b) some or all of the payment (the **_nonassessable part_**) is not included in your assessable income.

    * To avoid doubt, in applying paragraph (b) to work out what part of the payment is included in your assessable income, disregard your share of the trust's net income that is subject to the rules in subsection 115215(3).

          * Note 1: Subsections 10471(1) (taxexempted amounts), 10471(3) (taxfree amounts) and 10471(4) (CGT concession amounts) can affect the calculation of the nonassessable part.

          * Note 2: The nonassessable part includes amounts (taxdeferred amounts) associated with the small business 50% reduction, frozen indexation, building allowance and accounting differences in income.

          * Note 3: A payment made to you after you stop owning the unit or interest in the trust forms part of the capital proceeds for the CGT event that happened when you stopped owning it.

    * (2) The payment can include giving property (see section 1035).

    * (3) The time of the event is:

      * (a) just before the end of the income year in which the trustee makes the payment; or

      * (b) if another *CGT event (except CGT event E4) happens in relation to the unit or interest or part of it after the trustee makes the payment but before the end of that income year--just before the time of that other CGT event.

    * (4) You make a **_capital gain_** if the sum of the amounts of the nonassessable parts of the payments made in the income year made by the trustee in respect of the unit or interest is _more_ than its *cost base.

          * Note: You cannot make a capital loss.

    * (5) If you make a *capital gain, the *cost base and *reduced cost base of the unit or interest are reduced to nil.

          * Note: A capital gain under former section 160ZM of the _Income Tax Assessment Act 1936_ is also taken into account for the purposes of this subsection: see subsection 10470(3) of the _Income Tax (Transitional Provisions) Act 1997_.

    * (6) However, if that sum is not more than the *cost base:

      * (a) the cost base is reduced by that sum; and

      * (b) the *reduced cost base is reduced by that sum (without the adjustment in subsection 10471(3)).

          * Example: Mandy owns units in a unit trust that she bought on 1 July 1998 for $10 each. During the 19992000 income year the trustee makes 4 nonassessable payments of $0.50 per unit. If at the end of the income year Mandy's cost base for each unit (including indexation) would otherwise be $10.10, the payments require that it be reduced by $2, giving a new cost base of $8.10. If Mandy sells the units (CGT event A1) in the 200001 year for more than their cost base at that time, she will make a capital gain equal to the difference.

          * Note: Cost base adjustments are made only under Subdivision 125B if there is a rollover under that Subdivision for CGT event E4 happening as a result of a demerger.

    * Exceptions

    * (7) A *capital gain you make from *CGT event E4 is disregarded if you *acquired the *CGT asset that is the unit or interest before 20 September 1985.

    * (8) **_CGT event E4_** does not happen to the extent that the payment is reasonably attributable to a *LIC capital gain.

    * (9) **_CGT event E4_** does not happen for a payment made to a foreign resident to the extent that the payment is reasonably attributable to *ordinary income or *statutory income from sources other than an *Australian source. However, this exception does not apply if the trust is a *corporate unit trust or a *public trading trust.

##### 10471  Adjustment of nonassessable part

    * (1) In working out the nonassessable part referred to in section 10470, disregard any part of the payment that is:

      * (a) *nonassessable nonexempt income; or

      * (c) paid from an amount that has been assessed to the trustee; or

      * (d) paid from an amount that is *personal services income included in your assessable income, or another entity's assessable income, under section 8615; or

      * (da) a payment to which paragraph 11837(1)(ba) applies (about compensation paid through a trust); or

      * (db) a payment to which subsection 118300(1A) applies (about insurance and annuity payments paid through a trust); or

      * (e) repaid by you; or

      * (f) compensation you paid that can reasonably be regarded as a repayment of all or part of the payment; or

      * (g) an amount referred to in section 152125 (which exempts a payment of a small business 15year exemption amount) as an exempt amount.

    * The payment can include giving property (see section 1035).

    * (2) However, the nonassessable part is not reduced by any part of the payment that you can deduct.

    * (3) The amount of the nonassessable part referred to in section 10470 is adjusted to exclude any part of it that is attributable to:

      * (a) an amount that is not included in the assessable income of an entity because of:

        * (i) section 124ZM or 124ZN (which exempt income arising from *shares in a *PDF) of the _Income Tax Assessment Act 1936_; or

        * (ii) section 159GZZZZE (which exempts certain payments related to infrastructure borrowings) of that Act; or

      * (b) proceeds from a *CGT event that happens in relation to *shares in a company that was a *PDF when that event happened.

    * (4) The amount of the nonassessable part referred to in section 10470 for an entity shown in the table is adjusted to exclude the amount or amounts applicable to the entity under the table.

          * Example: Claude is paid $100 by the trustee of a unit trust. The trustee advises that the amount comprises $50 CGT discount, $25 small business 50% reduction and $25 net income from a capital gain made by the trust.

          * In applying the rules in Subdivision 115C of the _Income Tax Assessment Act 1997_, Claude reduces his capital gain of $100 by a $20 net capital loss from an earlier year. He then reduces the remaining $80 gain by $40 (CGT discount) and $20 (small business 50% reduction) leaving a net capital gain of $20.

          * In applying the rules in CGT event E4, the $100 payment is reduced by $25 (being the amount assessed under section 97 of the _Income Tax Assessment Act 1936_). It is further reduced by $50 under item 1 of the table and $5 under item 3. Claude's nonassessable part is $20.

          * Effectively, CGT event E4 applies to the $20 small business 50% reduction allowed to Claude in applying Subdivision 115C of the _Income Tax Assessment Act 1997_.

          * Note 1: Step 3 of the method statement in subsection 1025(1) (see table item 1) reduces by 50% the trust's discount capital gains remaining after applying capital losses and earlier net capital losses. That 50% is excluded from the trust's net capital gain.

          * Note 2: Subdivision 152C (small business 50% reduction--see table items 2, 3, 4, 5, 6 and 7) reduces by 50% the trust's capital gains or discount capital gains remaining after applying step 3 of the method statement in subsection 1025(1). That 50% is also excluded from the trust's net capital gain.

          * Note 3: Paragraph 115215(3)(b) or (c) (see table items 2, 3, 4, 5 and 6) treats a beneficiary as having an extra capital gain if an amount of the trust's net income that is included in the beneficiary's assessable income is attributable to trust gains that were reduced by step 3 of the method statement in subsection 1025(1) and/or the small business 50% reduction.

    * (5) A **_chain of trusts_** consists of 2 or more trusts where at least one of these conditions is satisfied for each of the trusts:

      * (a) the trustee of the trust owns units or interests in another of the trusts; or

      * (b) the trustee of another of the trusts owns units or interests in the trust.

##### 10472  Reducing your capital gain under CGT event E4 if you are a trustee

    * (1) A *capital gain you make under subsection 10470(4) is reduced if:

      * (a) you are the trustee of another trust that is a *fixed trust and is not a *complying superannuation entity; and

      * (b) you are taken to have a *capital gain under paragraph 115215(3)(b) or (c) (your **_notional gain_**) in respect of a corresponding trust gain (the **_trust gain_**); and

      * (c) some or all (the **_attributable amount_**) of the total of the nonassessable parts referred to in subsection 10470(4) is attributable to proceeds from the trust gain.

    * (2) The *capital gain is reduced (but not below 0) by the lesser of:

      * (a) your notional gain; and

      * (b) the attributable amount.

##### 10475  Beneficiary becoming entitled to a trust asset: CGT event E5

    * (1) **_CGT event E5 _**happens if a beneficiary becomes absolutely entitled to a *CGT asset of a trust (except a unit trust or a trust to which Division 128 applies) as against the trustee (disregarding any legal disability the beneficiary is under).

          * Note: Division 128 deals with the effect of death.

    * (2) The time of the event is when the beneficiary becomes absolutely entitled to the asset.

    * Trustee makes a capital gain or loss

    * (3) The trustee makes a **_capital gain_** if the *market value of the asset (at the time of the event) is _more_ than its *cost base. The trustee makes a **_capital loss_** if that market value is _less_ than the asset's *reduced cost base.

    * Exception for trustee

    * (4) A *capital gain or *capital loss the trustee makes is disregarded if it *acquired the asset before 20 September 1985.

    * Beneficiary makes a capital gain or loss

    * (5) The beneficiary makes a **_capital gain_** if the *market value of the asset (at the time of the event) is _more_ than the *cost base of the beneficiary's interest in the trust capital to the extent it relates to the asset. 

    * The beneficiary makes a **_capital loss_** if that market value is _less_ than the *reduced cost base of that beneficiary's interest in the trust capital to the extent it relates to the asset.

    * Exceptions for beneficiary

    * (6) A *capital gain or *capital loss the beneficiary makes is disregarded if:

      * (a) the beneficiary *acquired the *CGT asset that is the interest (except by way of an assignment from another entity) for no expenditure; or

      * (b) the beneficiary acquired it before 20 September 1985; or

      * (c) all or part of the capital gain or capital loss the trustee makes from the *CGT event is disregarded under Subdivision 118B (about main residence).

    *  Expenditure can include giving property: see section 1035.

          * Note 1: For provisions affecting the application of Subdivision 118B to the trustee, see sections 118215 to 118230.

##### 10480  Disposal to beneficiary to end income right: CGT event E6

    * (1) **_CGT event E6 _**happens if the trustee of a trust (except a unit trust or a trust to which Division 128 applies) *disposes of a *CGT asset of the trust to a beneficiary in satisfaction of the beneficiary's right, or part of it, to receive *ordinary income or *statutory income from the trust.

          * Note: Division 128 deals with the effect of death.

    * (2) The time of the event is when the disposal occurs.

    * Trustee makes a capital gain or loss

    * (3) The trustee makes a **_capital gain_** if the *market value of the asset (at the time of the disposal) is _more_ than its *cost base. It makes a **_capital loss_** if that market value is _less_ than the asset's *reduced cost base.

    * Exception for trustee

    * (4) A *capital gain or *capital loss the trustee makes is disregarded if it *acquired the asset before 20 September 1985.

    * Beneficiary makes a capital gain or loss

    * (5) The beneficiary makes a **_capital gain_** if the *market value of the asset (at the time of the disposal) is _more_ than the *cost base of the right, or the part of it. The beneficiary makes a **_capital loss_** if that market value is _less_ than the *reduced cost base of the right or part.

          * Note: If the beneficiary did not pay anything for the right, the market value substitution rule does not apply: see section 11220.

    * Exception for beneficiary

    * (6) A *capital gain or *capital loss the beneficiary makes is disregarded if it *acquired the *CGT asset that is the right before 20 September 1985.

##### 10485  Disposal to beneficiary to end capital interest: CGT event E7

    * (1) **_CGT event E7 _**happens if the trustee of a trust (except a unit trust or a trust to which Division 128 applies) *disposes of a *CGT asset of the trust to a beneficiary in satisfaction of the beneficiary's interest, or part of it, in the trust capital.

      * (b) if there is no contract--when you stop owning the interest or part.

          * Note 1: You work out if you have made a capital gain or capital loss under sections 10495 and 104100.

          * Note 2: There is a special indexation rule for this event: see section 11410.

##### 10495  Making a capital gain

    * You are the only beneficiary

    * (1) If you are the only beneficiary with an interest in the trust capital and you *dispose of that interest, you work out if you have made a *capital gain in this way:

    * _Working out your capital gain_

        * _Step 1.	Work out the *capital proceeds from the *disposal.

        * Step 2.	Work out the *net asset amount.

        * Step 3.	If the Step 1 amount is _greater_, you make a **_capital gain_** equal to the difference.

    * (2) The **_net asset amount_** is worked out in this way:

    * _Working out the net asset amount_

        * _Step 1.	Work out the total of the *cost bases (at the time of the disposal) of the *CGT assets that the trustee *acquired on or after 20 September 1985 and that formed part of the trust capital at that time.

        * Step 2.	Work out the total of the *market values (at the time of the disposal) of the *CGT assets that the trustee *acquired before 20 September 1985 and that formed part of the trust capital at that time.

        * Step 3.	Work out the amount of money that formed part of the trust capital at the time of the disposal.

        * Step 4.	Add up the Step 1, 2 and 3 amounts.

        * Step 5.	Subtract from the Step 4 amount any liabilities of the trust at the time of the disposal.

        * Step 6.	The result is the **_net asset amount_**.

          * Example: You dispose of your interest in the trust capital for $10,000 (the capital proceeds).

          * The total of the cost bases of the CGT assets that the trustee acquired on or after 20 September 1985 is $6,000.

          * The total of the market values of the CGT assets that the trustee acquired before 20 September 1985 is $2,500.

          * There is $1,000 in the trust. The trust liabilities are $500.

          * The net asset amount is: 

          * You make a capital gain of: 

    * (3) If you *dispose of only _part_ of that interest, any *capital gain is worked out using the method statement in subsection (1), except that the Step 2 amount is replaced by:

          * Example: To vary the example in subsection (2), suppose you dispose of 50% of your interest for $5,000 (the capital proceeds).

          * The Step 2 amount becomes: 

          * You make a capital gain of: 

    * There is more than one beneficiary

    * (4) If you are _not_ the only beneficiary with an interest in the trust capital and you *dispose of your interest, any *capital gain is worked out using the method statement in subsection (1), except that the Step 2 amount is replaced by:

          * Example: To vary the example in subsection (2), suppose you have a 20% interest in the trust capital and you dispose of it for $4,000 (the capital proceeds).

          * The Step 2 amount becomes: 

          * You make a capital gain of: 

    * (5) If you are _not_ the only beneficiary with an interest in the trust capital and you *dispose of _part_ of your interest, any *capital gain is worked out using the method statement in subsection (1), except that the Step 2 amount is replaced by:

          * Example: To vary the example in subsection (2), suppose you have a 50% interest in the trust capital. You dispose of 20% of it for $1,000 (the capital proceeds).

          * The Step 2 amount becomes: 

          * You make a capital gain of: 

    * Exception

    * (6) A *capital gain you make is disregarded if you *acquired the *CGT asset that is the interest in the trust capital before 20 September 1985.

          * Note: You can make a gain if you dispose of an interest in a trust that you acquired before that day: see CGT event K6.

##### 104100  Making a capital loss

    * You are the only beneficiary

    * (1) If you are the only beneficiary with an interest in the trust capital and you *dispose of that interest, you work out if you have made a *capital loss in this way:

    * _Working out your capital loss_

        * _Step 1.	Work out the *capital proceeds from the *disposal.

        * Step 2.	Work out the *reduced net asset amount.

        * Step 3.	If the Step 1 amount is _less_, you make a **_capital loss_** equal to the difference.

    * (2) The **_reduced net asset amount_** is worked out in this way:

    * _Working out the reduced net asset amount_

        * _Step 1.	Work out the total of the *reduced cost bases (at the time of the disposal) of the *CGT assets that the trustee *acquired on or after 20 September 1985 and that formed part of the trust capital at that time.

        * Step 2.	Work out the total of the *market values (at the time of the disposal) of the *CGT assets that the trustee *acquired before 20 September 1985 and that formed part of the trust capital at that time.

        * Step 3.	Work out the amount of money that formed part of the trust capital at the time of the disposal.

        * Step 4.	Add up the Step 1, 2 and 3 amounts.

        * Step 5.	Subtract from the Step 4 amount any liabilities of the trust at the time of the disposal.

        * Step 6.	The result is the **_reduced net asset amount_**.

    * (3) If you *dispose of only _part_ of that interest, any *capital loss is worked out using the method statement in subsection (1), except that the Step 2 amount is replaced by:

    * There is more than one beneficiary

    * (4) If you are _not_ the only beneficiary with an interest in the trust capital and you *dispose of your interest, any *capital loss is worked out using the method statement in subsection (1), except that the Step 2 amount is replaced by:

    * (5) If you are _not_ the only beneficiary with an interest in the trust capital and you *dispose of _part_ of your interest, any *capital loss is worked out using the method statement in subsection (1), except that the Step 2 amount is replaced by:

    * Exception

    * (6) A *capital loss you make is disregarded if you *acquired the *CGT asset that is the interest in the trust capital before 20 September 1985.

##### 104105  Creating a trust over future property: CGT event E9

    * (1) **_CGT event E9_** happens if:

      * (a) you agree for consideration that when property comes into existence you will hold it on trust; and

      * (b) at the time of the agreement, no potential beneficiary under the trust has a beneficial interest in the rights created by the agreement.

    * (2) The time of the event is when you made the agreement.

    * (3) You make a **_capital gain_** if the *market value the property would have had if it had existed when you made the agreement is _more_ than any *incidental costs you incurred that relate to the event. You make a **_capital loss_** if that market value is _less_.

    * (4) The costs can include giving property: see section 1035. However, they do not include an amount you have received as *recoupment of them and that is not included in your assessable income, or an amount to the extent that you have deducted or can deduct it.

##### Subdivision 104F--Leases

##### 104110  Granting a lease: CGT event F1

    * (1) **_CGT event F1_** happens if a lessor grants, renews or extends a lease.

          * Note 1: Other CGT events can apply to leases. An assignment of a lease is an example of CGT event A1.

          * Note 2: There are special rules that apply to some lease transactions: see Division 132.

    * (2) The time of the event is:

      * (a) for the grant of a lease:

        * (i) when the contract for the lease is entered into; or

        * (ii) if there is no contract--at the start of the lease; or

      * (b) for a renewal or extension--at the start of the renewal or extension.

    * (3) The lessor makes a **_capital gain_** if the *capital proceeds from the grant, renewal or extension are _more_ than the expenditure it incurred on the grant, renewal or extension. It makes a **_capital loss_** if those capital proceeds are _less_.

    * (4) The expenditure can include giving property: see section 1035. However, it does not include an amount you have received as *recoupment of it and that is not included in your assessable income, or an amount to the extent that you have deducted or can deduct it.

    * Exception

    * (5) The lessor can choose to apply section 104115 to certain long term leases. If it does so, this section does not apply.

##### 104115  Granting a longterm lease: CGT event F2

    * (1) **_CGT event F2_** happens if:

      * (a) a lessor grants a lease over land (whether or not the lessor owns an estate in fee simple in the land), or renews or extends a lease over land; and

      * (b) the lease, renewal or extension is for at least 50 years and:

        * (i) at the time of the grant, renewal or extension, it was reasonable to expect that it would continue for at least 50 years; and

        * (ii) the terms of the lease, renewal or extension as they apply to the lessee are substantially the same as those under which the lessor owned the land or held a lease of the land; and

      * (c) the lessor chooses to apply this section instead of section 104110.

          * Note: Section 10325 tells you when the choice must be made.

    * (2) The time of the event is when the lessor grants the lease, or at the start of the renewal or extension, as appropriate.

    * (3) The lessor makes a **_capital gain_** if the *capital proceeds from the event are _more_ than the *cost base of the lessor's interest in the land. The lessor makes a **_capital loss _**if those capital proceeds are _less_ than the *reduced cost base of that interest.

    * Exceptions

    * (4) A *capital gain or *capital loss the lessor makes is disregarded if:

      * (a) it *acquired the *CGT asset that is the land, or the lease to the lessor was granted, before 20 September 1985; or

      * (b) the lease to the lessor has been renewed or extended and the last renewal or extension started before that day.

          * Note: For any later CGT event that happens to the land or the lessor's lease of it: see section 13210.

##### 104120  Lessor pays lessee to get lease changed: CGT event F3

    * (1) **_CGT event F3_** happens if a lessor incurs expenditure in getting the lessee's agreement to vary or waive a term of the lease. The lessor makes a **_capital loss_** equal to the amount of expenditure it incurred. (The expenditure can include giving property: see section 1035.)

    * (2) The time of the event is when the term is varied or waived.

    * Exception

    * (3) However, this event does not apply to expenditure for a lease to which the lessor has chosen to apply section 104115.

##### 104125  Lessee receives payment for changing lease: CGT event F4

    * (1) **_CGT event F4 _**happens if a lessee receives a payment from the lessor for agreeing to vary or waive a term of the lease.

    *  The payment can include giving property: see section 1035.

    * (2) The time of the event is when the term is varied or waived.

    * (3) The lessee makes a **_capital gain_** if the *capital proceeds from the event are _more_ than the lease's *cost base (at the time of the event). If the lessee makes a *capital gain, the lease's cost base is also reduced to nil.

          * Note: The lessee cannot make a capital loss.

    * (4) On the other hand, if those *capital proceeds are _less_, the lease's *cost base is reduced by that amount at the time of the event.

          * Example: On 1 January 1999 a lessee enters a lease. On 1 May 1999 the lessee agrees to waive a term. The lessor pays the lessee $1,000 for this.

          * If the lease's cost base at the time of the waiver is $2,500, it is reduced from $2,500 to $1,500.

          * On 1 September 1999 the lessee agrees to waive another term. The lessor pays the lessee $2,000 for this.

          * If the lease's cost base at the time of the waiver is $1,500, the lessee makes a capital gain of $500, and the cost base is reduced to nil.

    * Exceptions

    * (5) A *capital gain the lessee makes is disregarded if:

      * (a) the lease was granted before 20 September 1985; or

      * (b) for a lease that has been renewed or extended--the start of the last renewal or extension occurred before that day.

##### 104130  Lessor receives payment for changing lease: CGT event F5

    * (1) **_CGT event F5_** happens if a lessor receives a payment from the lessee for agreeing to vary or waive a term of the lease.

    *  The payment can include giving property: see section 1035.

    * (2) The time of the event is when the term is varied or waived.

    * (3) The lessor makes a **_capital gain_** if the *capital proceeds from the event are _more_ than the expenditure the lessor incurs in relation to the variation or waiver. The lessor makes a **_capital loss_** if those capital proceeds are _less_.

          * Example: You own a shopping centre. The lessee of a shop in the centre pays you $10,000 for agreeing to change the terms of its lease. You incur expenses of $1,000 for a solicitor and $500 for a valuer. You make a capital gain of $8,500.

    * (4) The expenditure can include giving property: see section 1035. However, it does not include an amount you have received as *recoupment of it and that is not included in your assessable income.

    * Exceptions

    * (5) A *capital gain or *capital loss the lessor makes is disregarded if:

      * (a) the lease was granted before 20 September 1985; or

      * (b) for a lease that has been renewed or extended--the start of the last renewal or extension occurred before that day.

      * (a) repaid by you; or

      * (b) compensation you paid that can reasonably be regarded as a repayment of all or part of the payment; or

    *  The payment can include giving property: see section 1035.

    * (1B) However, the nonassessable part is not reduced by any part of the payment that you can deduct.

    * (2) The time of the event is when the company makes the payment.

    * (3) You make a **_capital gain_** if the amount of the nonassessable part is _more_ than the *share's *cost base. If you make a *capital gain, the share's *cost base and *reduced cost base are reduced to nil.

          * Note 1: You cannot make a capital loss.

          * Note 2: A capital gain under former section 160ZL of the _Income Tax Assessment Act 1936_ is also taken into account for the purposes of this subsection: see section 104135 of the _Income Tax (Transitional Provisions) Act 1997_.

    * (4) However, if the amount of the nonassessable part is not more than the *share's *cost base, that cost base and its *reduced cost base are reduced by the amount of the nonassessable part.

          * Note: Cost base adjustments are made only under Subdivision 125B if there is a rollover under that Subdivision for CGT event G1 happening as a result of a demerger.

    * Exceptions

    * (5) A *capital gain you make is disregarded if you *acquired the *CGT asset that is the *share before 20 September 1985.

    * (6) You disregard a payment by a liquidator for the purposes of this section if the company ceases to exist within 18 months of the payment.

          * Note: The payment will be part of your capital proceeds for CGT event C2 happening when the share ends.

    * (7) You also disregard a payment that is *personal services income included in your assessable income, or another entity's assessable income, under section 8615.

##### 104145  Liquidator or administrator declares shares or financial instruments worthless: CGT event G3

    * (1) **_CGT event G3_** happens if you own *shares in a company, or financial instruments issued by or created by or in relation to a company, and a liquidator or administrator of the company declares in writing that the liquidator or administrator has reasonable grounds to believe (as at the time of the declaration) that:

      * (a) for shares--there is no likelihood that shareholders in the company, or shareholders of the relevant class of shares, will receive any further distribution for their shares; or

      * (b) for financial instruments--the instruments, or a class of instruments that includes instruments of that kind, have no value or have only negligible value.

    * (3) Examples of financial instruments referred to in subsection (1) are:

      * (a) *debentures, bonds or promissory notes issued by the company; and

      * (b) loans to the company; and

      * (c) futures contracts, forward contracts or currency swap contracts relating to the company; and

      * (d) rights or options to acquire an asset referred to in a preceding paragraph of this subsection; and

      * (e) rights or options to acquire *shares in the company.

    * (4) You can choose to make a **_capital loss_** equal to the *reduced cost base of your *shares or financial instruments (as at the time of the declaration).

    * (5) If you make the choice, the *cost base and *reduced cost base of the *shares or financial instruments are reduced to nil just after the declaration was made.

          * Note: This is for the purpose of working out if you make a capital gain or loss from any later CGT event in relation to the shares or financial instruments.

    * Exceptions

    * (6) You cannot choose to make a *capital loss if:

      * (a) you *acquired the shares or financial instruments before 20 September 1985; or

    *  The payment can include giving property: see section 1035.

          * Example: You decide to sell land. Before entering into a contract of sale, the prospective purchaser pays you a 2 month holding deposit of $1,000.

          * The negotiations fail and the deposit is forfeited.

    * (1A) The amount of the deposit is reduced by any part of the deposit that is:

          * No contractual rights or obligations are created by the arrangement.

          * The payment is made because of an event (the inducement to start construction early) in relation to your land.

          * Note: This event does not apply if any other CGT event applies: see section 10225.

    * (2) The time of the event is when the act, transaction or event occurs.

      * (a) if there is only one replacement asset that satisfied paragraph (1)(b) and, if applicable, paragraph (1)(c)--the amount of the capital gain that you disregarded under Subdivision 152E (the **_152E amount_**); or

      * (b) if there are 2 or more replacement assets that satisfied paragraph (1)(b) and, if applicable, paragraph (1)(c) and a change of a kind specified in subsection (2) or (3) occurs for all of them--the 152E amount; or

      * (c) if there are 2 or more replacement assets that satisfied paragraph (1)(b) and, if applicable, paragraph (1)(c) and such a change occurs for one or more but not all of them--so much (if any) of the 152E amount as exceeds the sum of the following:

        * (i) the first element of the *cost base of each of those replacement assets *acquired;

        * (ii) the *incidental costs you incurred to acquire each of those replacement assets (which can include giving property, see section 1035);

        * (iii) the amount of *fourth element expenditure incurred in relation to each of those replacement assets;

      * in relation to which such a change did not occur.

    * (6) If *CGT event J6 has happened in relation to the small business rollover under Subdivision 152E, subsection (5) applies to the 152E amount reduced by the amount of the capital gain under that event.

    * (7) If *CGT event J2 happens again in a later income year in relation to the small business rollover under Subdivision 152E, subsection (5) applies to any remaining part of the 152E amount reduced by the amount of the capital gain under the earlier event.

    * (8) **_CGT event J2_** does not happen because of paragraph (2)(a) for a *share in a company or an interest in a trust if the share or interest ceased to be an *active asset only because of changes in the *market values of assets that were owned by the company or trust when you *acquired the share or interest or incurred the *fourth element expenditure.

    * (9) You incur **_fourth element expenditure_** in relation to a *CGT asset if you incur capital expenditure that is included, under subsection 11025(5), in the fourth element of the *cost base of the asset.

##### 104190  Modifying or extending the replacement asset period

    * (1) The replacement asset period is modified if your *capital proceeds for the *CGT event are increased under subsection 11645(2) or 11660(3) after the end of that period. Instead, you have until 12 months after you receive those additional proceeds to *acquire a replacement asset, or incur *fourth element expenditure in relation to a *CGT asset, or do both.

          * Note: Section 11645 applies if you do not receive your capital proceeds despite having taken all reasonable steps to get them, and section 11660 applies if your capital proceeds are misappropriated by your employee or agent.

    * (2) The Commissioner may extend the replacement asset period, or that period as modified by subsection (1).

##### 104195  Trust failing to cease to exist after rollover under Subdivision 124N: CGT event J4

    * (1) **_CGT event J4_** happens if:

      * (a) there is a rollover under Subdivision 124N for a trust *disposing of a *CGT asset to a company under a trust restructure; and

      * (b) the trust fails to cease to exist:

        * (i) within 6 months after the start of the *trust restructuring period; or

        * (ii) if that is not possible because of circumstances outside the control of the trustee--as soon as practicable after the end of that 6 month period; and

      * (c) the company owns the asset when the failure happens.

          * Example: Circumstances would be outside the control of the trustee if the trustee is involved in litigation concerning the trust and cannot wind up the trust until the litigation is finished.

    * (2) **_CGT event J4_** also happens if:

      * (a) there is a rollover under Subdivision 124N for an entity (the **_shareholding entity_**) receiving a *share in a company in exchange for a unit or interest in a trust under a trust restructure; and

      * (b) the trust fails to cease to exist:

        * (i) within 6 months after the start of the *trust restructuring period; or

        * (ii) if that is not possible because of circumstances outside the control of the trustee--as soon as practicable after the end of that 6 month period; and

      * (c) the shareholding entity owns the share when the failure happens.

    * (3) The time of the event is when the failure to cease to exist happens.

    * (4) The company makes a **_capital gain_** if the *CGT asset's *market value at the time the company *acquired the asset is more than its *cost base at that time. The company makes a **_capital loss_** if that market value is less than the asset's *reduced cost base at that time.

    * (5) This Part and Part 33 apply to the company from just after the time of the event as if the first element of the *cost base and *reduced cost base of the asset were its *market value at the time the company *acquired the asset.

    * (6) The shareholding entity makes a **_capital gain_** if the *share's *market value at the time the entity *acquired the share is more than its *cost base at that time. The shareholding entity makes a **_capital loss_** if that market value is less than the share's *reduced cost base at that time.

    * (7) This Part and Part 33 apply to the shareholding entity from just after the time of the event as if the first element of the *cost base and *reduced cost base of the *share were its *market value at the time the entity *acquired the share.

    * Exception

    * (8) This section does not apply to a *CGT asset acquired under a trust restructure that happened before the day on which the _Taxation Laws Amendment Act (No. 4) 2002_ received the Royal Assent.

##### 104197  Failure to acquire replacement asset and to incur fourth element expenditure after a rollover under Subdivision 152E: CGT event J5

    * (1) **_CGT event J5 _**happens if you choose a small business rollover under Subdivision 152E for a *CGT event that happens in relation to a *CGT asset in an income year and, by the end of the replacement asset period:

      * (a) you have not *acquired a replacement asset (the **_replacement asset_**), and have not incurred *fourth element expenditure in relation to a CGT asset (also the **_replacement asset_**); or

      * (b) the replacement asset does not satisfy the conditions set out in subsection (2).

          * Note: You do not have to satisfy the basic conditions in Subdivision 152A for the gain in relation to CGT event J5 (see subsection 152305(4)).

    * (2) The conditions are:

      * (a) the replacement asset must be your *active asset; and

      * (b) if the replacement asset is a *share in a company or an interest in a trust:

        * (i) you, or an entity *connected with you, must be a *CGT concession stakeholder in the company or trust; or

        * (ii) CGT concession stakeholders in the company or trust must have a *small business participation percentage in you of at least 90%.

          * Example: Joseph owns 50% of the shares in Company A and Company B. He is therefore a CGT concession stakeholder in the companies: see section 15260. The companies are connected with Joseph (see section 328125) because he controls both of them.

          * Company A owns land which it leases to Joseph for use in a business. It sells the land at a profit and buys shares in Company B.

          * Subsection (2) is satisfied for the shares because Joseph is connected with Company A and is a CGT concession stakeholder in Company B.

    * (3) The time of the event is at the end of the replacement asset period.

    * (4) You make a **_capital gain_** equal to the amount of the *capital gain that you disregarded under Subdivision 152E.

    * (5) The replacement asset period may be modified or extended as mentioned in section 104190.

##### 104198  Cost of acquisition of replacement asset or amount of fourth element expenditure, or both, not sufficient to cover disregarded capital gain: CGT event J6

    * (1) **_CGT event J6 _**happens if you choose a small business rollover under Subdivision 152E for a *CGT event that happens in relation to a *CGT asset in an income year and:

      * (a) by the end of the replacement asset period, you have done either or both of the following:

        * (i) *acquired a replacement asset (the **_replacement asset_**);

        * (ii) incurred *fourth element expenditure in relation to a CGT asset (also the **_replacement asset_**); and

      * (b) at the end of the replacement asset period, the replacement asset is your *active asset; and

      * (c) if the replacement asset is a *share in a company or an interest in a trust, at the end of the replacement asset period:

        * (i) you, or an entity *connected with you, are a *CGT concession stakeholder in the company or trust; or

        * (ii) CGT concession stakeholders in the company or trust have a *small business participation percentage in you of at least 90%; and

      * (d) the total (the **_amount incurred_**) of the following, in relation to each replacement asset that satisfied paragraph (b) and, if applicable, paragraph (c), is less than the amount of the capital gain that you disregarded:

        * (i) the first element of the *cost base;

        * (ii) the *incidental costs you incurred (which can include giving property, see section 1035);

        * (iii) the amount of fourth element expenditure incurred.

          * Note: You do not have to satisfy the basic conditions in Subdivision 152A for the gain in relation to CGT event J6 (see subsection 152305(4)).

    * (2) The time of the event is at the end of the replacement asset period.

    * (3) You make a **_capital gain_** equal to the difference between:

      * (a) the amount of the *capital gain that you disregarded under Subdivision 152E; and

      * (b) the amount incurred.

    * (4) The replacement asset period may be modified or extended as mentioned in section 104190.

##### 104205  Incoming international transfer of emissions unit: CGT event K1

    * (1) **_CGT event K1_** happens if:

      * (a) any of the following conditions is satisfied:

        * (iii) a *Kyoto unit is transferred from your foreign account (within the meaning of the _Australian National Registry of Emissions Units Act 2011_) to your Registry account (within the meaning of that Act) or your nominee's Registry account (within the meaning of that Act);

        * (iv) a Kyoto unit is transferred from your nominee's foreign account (within the meaning of the _Australian National Registry of Emissions Units Act 2011_) to your Registry account (within the meaning of that Act) or your nominee's Registry account (within the meaning of that Act);

        * (v) an *Australian carbon credit unit is transferred from your foreign account (within the meaning of the _Carbon Credits (Carbon Farming Initiative) Act 2011_) to your Registry account (within the meaning of the _Australian National Registry of Emissions Units Act 2011_) or your nominee's Registry account (within the meaning of the _Australian National Registry of Emissions Units Act 2011_);

        * (vi) an *Australian carbon credit unit is transferred from your nominee's foreign account (within the meaning of the _Carbon Credits (Carbon Farming Initiative) Act 2011_) to your Registry account (within the meaning of the _Australian National Registry of Emissions Units Act 2011_) or your nominee's Registry account (within the meaning of the _Australian National Registry of Emissions Units Act 2011_); and

      * (b) as a result of the transfer, you start to *hold the unit as a *registered emissions unit; and

      * (c) just before the transfer, the unit was neither your *trading stock nor your *revenue asset.

    * (2) The time of the event is when you start to *hold the unit as a *registered emissions unit.

    * (3) You make a **_capital gain_** if the unit's *market value (just before you started to *hold the unit as a *registered emissions unit) is _more_ than its *cost base. You make a**_ capital loss_** if that market value is _less_ than its *reduced cost base.

##### 104210  Bankrupt pays amount in relation to debt: CGT event K2

    * (1) **_CGT event K2_** happens if:

      * (a) you made a *net capital loss for an income year that, because of subsection 1025(2), cannot be applied in working out whether you made a *net capital gain for the income year or a later one; and

      * (b) you make a payment in an income year (the **_payment year_**) in respect of a debt that was taken into account in working out the amount of that net capital loss; and

      * (c) ignoring subsection 1025(2), some part of the net capital loss (the **_denied part_**) would have been applied (if you had made sufficient *capital gains) in working out whether you had made a *net capital gain for the payment year.

    *  The payment can include giving property: see section 1035.

    * (2) The time of the event is when you make the payment.

    * (3) You make a **_capital loss_** equal to the smallest of:

      * (a) the amount you paid; or

      * (b) that part of it that was taken into account in working out the denied part; or

      * (c) the denied part less the sum of *capital losses you made as a result of previous payments you made in respect of the debt that was taken into account in working out the denied part.

    * (4) In calculating that **_capital loss_**, disregard any amount you have received as *recoupment of the payment and that is not included in your assessable income.

##### 104215  Asset passing to taxadvantaged entity: CGT event K3

    * (1) **_CGT event K3_** happens if you die and a *CGT asset you owned just before dying *passes to a beneficiary in your estate who (when the asset passes):

      * (a) is an *exempt entity; or

      * (b) is the trustee of a *complying superannuation entity; or

      * (c) is a foreign resident.

    * (2) If the asset passes to a beneficiary who is a foreign resident, **_CGT event K3 _**happens only if:

      * (a) you were an Australian resident just before dying; and

      * (b) the asset (in the hands of the beneficiary) is not *taxable Australian property.

    * (3) The time of the event is just before you die.

    * (4) A **_capital gain_** is made if the *market value of the asset on the day you died is _more_ than the asset's *cost base. A **_capital loss_** is made if that market value is _less_ than the asset's *reduced cost base.

          * Note: The trustee of the estate must include in the date of death return any net capital gain for the income year when you died.

    * Exception

    * (5) A *capital gain or *capital loss is disregarded if you *acquired the asset before 20 September 1985.

          * Note: There is also an exception for certain philanthropic testamentary gifts: see section 11860.

##### 104220  CGT asset starts being trading stock: CGT event K4

    * (1) **_CGT event K4_** happens if:

      * (a) you start holding as *trading stock a *CGT asset you already own but do not hold as trading stock; and

      * (b) you elect under paragraph 7030(1)(a) to be treated as having sold the asset for its *market value.

          * Note 1: Paragraph 7030(1)(a) allows you to elect the cost of the asset, or its market value, just before it became trading stock.

          * Note 2: There is an exemption if you elect its cost: see section 11825.

    * (2) The time of the event is when you start.

    * (3) You make a **_capital gain_** if the asset's *market value (just before it became *trading stock) is _more_ than its *cost base. You make a **_capital loss_** if that market value is _less_ than its *reduced cost base.

    * Exception

    * (4) A *capital gain or *capital loss you make is disregarded if you *acquired the asset before 20 September 1985.

##### 104225  Special collectable losses: CGT event K5

    * (1) **_CGT event K5 _**happens if the requirements in subsections (2), (3) and (4) are satisfied.

    * (2) There is a fall in the *market value of a *collectable of a company or trust.

    * (3) *CGT event A1, C2 or E8 happens to:

      * (a) *shares you own in the company (or in a company that is a member of the same *whollyowned group); or

      * (b) an interest you have in the trust;

    * and there is no rollover for that CGT event.

    * (4) As a result of the *capital proceeds from that event being replaced under section 11680:

      * (a) you make a *capital gain that you would not otherwise have made; or

      * (b) you do not make the *capital loss you would otherwise have made; or

      * (c) you make a capital loss that is less than you would otherwise have made.

          * Note: The capital proceeds from that event are replaced with the market value of the shares or the interest in the trust as if the fall in the market value of collectables and personal use assets had not occurred: see section 11680.

    * (5) The time of CGT event K5 is the time of *CGT event A1, C2 or E8.

    * (6) You make a **_capital loss _**from a *collectable equal to:

       *  	the *market value of the *shares or the interest in the trust (worked out as at the time of *CGT event A1, C2 or E8 as if the fall in market value of the collectable had not occurred);

    * less: 

       *  	the actual *capital proceeds from CGT event A1, C2 or E8.

          * Example: You own 50% of the shares in a company. You bought them in 1999 for $60,000. The company owns a painting worth $100,000 and another asset worth $20,000. The painting falls in value to $50,000.

          * In 1999 you sell your shares for $35,000 (the actual capital proceeds). You would otherwise make a capital loss of $25,000.

          * However, the actual capital proceeds are replaced with $60,000 (the market value of the shares if the painting had not fallen in value). You do not make a capital loss from selling the shares.

          * You do make a collectable loss equal to: 

          * Note: You can subtract capital losses from collectables only from your capital gains from collectables: see section 10810.

##### 104230  PreCGT shares or trust interest: CGT event K6

    * (1) **_CGT event K6_** happens if:

      * (a) you own *shares in a company or an interest in a trust you *acquired _before_ 20 September 1985; and

      * (b) *CGT event A1, C2, E1, E2, E3, E5, E6, E7, E8, J1 or K3 happens in relation to the shares or interest; and

      * (c) there is no rollover for the other CGT event; and

      * (d) the applicable requirement in subsection (2) is satisfied.

    * (2) Just before the other event happened:

      * (a) the *market value of property of the company or trust (that is not its *trading stock) that was *acquired on or after 20 September 1985; or

      * (b) the market value of interests the company or trust owned through interposed companies or trusts in property (except trading stock) that was *acquired on or after 20 September 1985;

    * must be at least 75% of the *net value of the company or trust.

    * (5) The time of CGT event K6 is when the other event happens.

    * (6) You make a *capital gain equal to that part of the *capital proceeds from the *share or interest that is reasonably attributable to the amount by which the *market value of the property referred to in subsection (2) is _more_ than the sum of the *cost bases of that property.

          * Note: You cannot make a capital loss.

    * (7) This section applies to property that a company that is a foreign resident *acquired after 15 August 1989 from another company as if it were acquired before 20 September 1985 if:

      * (a) the other company acquired it before 20 September 1985; and

      * (b) the companies are members of the same *whollyowned group; and

      * (c) the property is not *taxable Australian property.

    * (8) In working out the *net value of a company or trust for the purposes of subsection (2), disregard:

      * (a) the discharge or release of any liabilities; or

      * (b) the *market value of any *CGT assets acquired;

    * if the discharge or release, or the *acquisition, was done for a purpose that included ensuring that the requirement in subsection (2) would not be satisfied in a particular situation.

    * Exceptions

    * (9) **_CGT event K6_** does not happen if:

      * (a) for a company referred to in subsection (2)--some of its *shares were listed for quotation in the official list of a stock exchange in Australia or a foreign country at the time of the other event and at all times in the period of 5 years before the time of the other event; or

      * (b) for a trust referred to in subsection (2) that is a unit trust--some of its units were so listed, or were ordinarily available to the public for subscription or purchase, at the time of the other event and at all times in that period.

    * (9A) Paragraph (9)(a) applies to a case where:

      * (a) the company referred to in subsection (2) is a *demerged entity; and

      * (b) *shares in the demerged entity do not satisfy the test referred to in that paragraph; and

      * (c) the demerger happened not more than 5 years before the other CGT event happened;

    * as if shares in the demerged entity were listed for quotation in the official list of a stock exchange in Australia or a foreign country at all times when some of the shares in the *head entity of the *demerger group were so listed.

          * Example: Louise owns shares in a company which has been listed for 3 years. The company is the head entity of a demerger group. As part of a demerger, she receives new interests in a demerged entity. The demerged entity then lists in its own right.

          * Since the head entity was listed for only 3 years, the demerged entity must remain listed for 2 years before Louise's new interests become eligible for the exception from CGT event K6.

    * (9B) Paragraph (9)(b) applies to a case where:

      * (a) the trust referred to in subsection (2) is a *demerged entity and a unit trust; and

      * (b) units in the demerged entity do not satisfy the test referred to in that paragraph; and

      * (c) the demerger happened not more than 5 years before the other CGT event happened;

    * as if units in the demerged entity were listed for quotation in the official list of a stock exchange in Australia or a foreign country, or were ordinarily available to the public for subscription or purchase, at all times when some of the units in the *head entity of the *demerger group were so listed or available.

    * (10) A *capital gain is disregarded for a *share in a company or an interest in a trust to the extent that, had you *acquired it on or after 20 September 1985, you could have chosen a rollover for the other *CGT event under Subdivision 124M (scrip for scrip rollover).

          * Example: Bill owns a unit in a trust that he acquired before 20 September 1985. He exchanges the unit for a unit in another trust worth $60 and $40 cash. He makes a capital gain of $50 because of CGT event K6.

          * Had the unit been acquired after 20 September 1985, Bill would have been entitled to a partial rollover of the capital gain under Subdivision 124M to the extent that his capital proceeds constituted a replacement unit.

          * Bill can therefore disregard 60/100 of the $50 gain ($30). The cost base of Bill's replacement unit is reduced by this amount. Bill must include the remaining $20 of the CGT event K6 gain in the calculation of his net capital gain or loss for the year.

          * Note: A capital gain or loss made by a demerging entity from CGT event K6 happening as a result of a demerger is also disregarded: see section 125155.

##### 104235  Balancing adjustment events for depreciating assets and certain assets used for R&D: CGT event K7

    * (1) **_CGT event K7_** happens if:

      * (a) a *balancing adjustment event occurs for a *depreciating asset you *held; and

      * (b) at some time when you held the asset, you used it, or had it *installed ready for use, for a purpose other than a *taxable purpose.

    * (1A) However, subsection (1) does not apply if:

      * (a) you are an *R&D entity and you could deduct an amount under section 4025 for the *depreciating asset if the following assumptions were made:

        * (i) despite paragraph 4030(1)(c) and subsection 4030(2), all intangible assets were excluded from the definition of **_depreciating asset_** in section 4030;

        * (ii) subsection 4045(2) did not, except in the case of buildings, prevent Division 40 from applying to capital works to which Division 43 applies, or to which Division 43 would apply but for expenditure being incurred, or capital works being started, before a particular day;

        * (iii) you satisfied any relevant requirement for deductibility under Division 40; or

      * (b) there is rollover relief for the *balancing adjustment event under section 40340 of this Act; or

      * (c) the asset is one for which you or another entity has deducted or can deduct amounts under Subdivision 40F or 40G.

    * (1AA) Without limiting subsection (1A), if the asset is a vessel for which:

      * (a) you have a *shipping exempt income certificate; or

      * (b) you have at any time had such a certificate;

    * subsection (1) does not apply in relation to the asset to the extent that you are using, or at any time have used, it to produce income that is exempt under section 51100.

    * (1B) **_CGT event K7 _**also happens if:

##### Guide to Division 106

##### 1061  What this Division is about

    * This Division sets out the cases where a capital gain or loss is made by someone other than the entity to which a CGT event happens.

    * The entities affected are: 

    * partnerships (Subdivision 106A);

     * bankruptcy trustees and company liquidators (Subdivision 106B);

     * trustees where there is an absolutely entitled beneficiary (Subdivision 106C);

    * security holders (Subdivision 106D).

##### Subdivision 106A--Partnerships

##### 1065  Partnerships

    * (1) Any *capital gain or *capital loss from a *CGT event happening in relation to a partnership or one of its *CGT assets is made by the partners individually.

    * Each partner's gain or loss is calculated by reference to the partnership agreement, or partnership law if there is no agreement.

          * Example 1: A partnership creates contractual rights in another entity (CGT event D1). Each partner's capital gain or loss is calculated by allocating an appropriate share of the capital proceeds from the event and the incidental costs that relate to the event (according to the partnership agreement, or partnership law if there is no agreement).

          * Example 2: Helen and Clare set up a business in partnership. Helen contributes a block of land to the partnership capital. Their partnership agreement recognises that Helen has a 75% interest in the land and Clare 25%. The agreement is silent as to their interests in other assets and profit sharing.

          * When the land is sold, Helen's capital gain or loss will be determined on the basis of her 75% interest. For other partnership assets, Helen's gain or loss will be determined on the basis of her 50% interest (under the relevant Partnership Act).

    * (2) Each partner has a separate *cost base and *reduced cost base for the partner's interest in each *CGT asset of the partnership.

    * (3) If a partner leaves a partnership, a remaining partner *acquires a separate *CGT asset to the extent that the remaining partner acquires a share of the departing partner's interest in a partnership asset.

          * Note: The remaining partners would not be affected if the departing partner sells its interests to an entity that was not a partner.

          * Example: (Indexation is ignored for the purpose of this example).

          * John, Wil and Patricia form a partnership (in equal shares).

          * John contributes a building (which is a pre20 September 1985 asset) having a market value of $200,000. Wil and Patricia contribute $200,000 each in cash.

          * The partnership buys another asset for $400,000.

          * John is taken to have disposed of 2/3 of his interest in the building (1/3 to Wil and 1/3 to Patricia). His remaining 1/3 share in the building remains a preCGT asset. The 1/3 shares that Wil and Patricia acquire are postCGT assets.

          * Wil retires from the partnership when the partnership assets have a market value of $1,200,000 ($500,000 for the building and $700,000 for the other asset). John and Patricia pay Wil $400,000 for his interest in the partnership.

          * Wil has a capital gain of $100,000 on the building and $100,000 on the other asset. John and Patricia each acquire an additional 1/6 interest in the partnership assets. These additional interests are separate assets and postCGT assets.

    * (4) If a new partner is admitted to a partnership:

      * (a) the new partner *acquires a share (according to the partnership agreement, or partnership law if there is no agreement) of each partnership asset; and

      * (b) the existing partners are treated as having *disposed of part of their interest in each partnership asset to the extent that the new partner has acquired it.

          * Example: (Indexation is ignored for the purpose of this example).

          * Lyn and Barry form a partnership, each contributing $15,000 to its capital. The partnership buys land for $30,000.

          * The land increases in value to $300,000.

          * Andrew is admitted as an equal partner, paying Lyn and Barry $50,000 each to acquire a 1/3 share in the land. His cost base is $100,000.

          * Lyn and Barry have each disposed of 1/3 of their interest in the land. Each has a cost base for that interest of $5,000, and capital proceeds of $50,000, leaving them with a capital gain of $45,000 each on Andrew's admission to the partnership.

          * The land is sold for its market value.

          * Andrew has no capital gain on the land.

          * Lyn and Barry have disposed of their remaining 2/3 original interest in the land for capital proceeds of $100,000, leaving each of them with a capital gain of:

       * 10630	Effect of bankruptcy

       * 10635	Effect of liquidation

##### 10630  Effect of bankruptcy

    * (1) For the purposes of this Part and Part 33 (about capital gains and losses) and Subdivision 328C (What is a small business entity), the vesting of the individual's *CGT assets in the trustee under the _Bankruptcy Act 1966_ or under a similar foreign law is ignored.

    * (2) This Part, Part 33 and Subdivision 328C apply to an act done in relation to a *CGT asset of an individual in these circumstances as if the act had been done by the individual (instead of by the trustee etc.):

      * (a) as a result of the bankruptcy of the individual by the Official Trustee in Bankruptcy or a registered trustee, or the holder of a similar office under a *foreign law;

      * (b) by a trustee under a personal insolvency agreement made under Part X of the _Bankruptcy Act 1966_, or under a similar instrument under a foreign law;

      * (c) by a trustee as a result of an arrangement with creditors under that Act or a foreign law.

          * Example: A CGT asset of an individual vests in a trustee because of the bankruptcy of the individual. No CGT event happens as a result of the vesting.

          * The trustee later sells the CGT asset. Any capital gain or loss is made by the individual, not the trustee.

##### 10635  Effect of liquidation

    * (1) For the purposes of this Part and Part 33 (about capital gains and losses) and Subdivision 328C (What is a small business entity), the vesting of a company's *CGT assets in a liquidator, or the holder of a similar office under a *foreign law, is ignored.

    * (2) This Part, Part 33 and Subdivision 328C apply to an act done by a liquidator of a company, or the holder of a similar office under a *foreign law, as if the act had been done by the company (instead of by the liquidator etc.).

          * Example: Ben, a liquidator of a company, sells a CGT asset of the company. Any capital gain or loss is made by the company, not by Ben.

##### 10650  Absolutely entitled beneficiaries

    * (1) For the purposes of this Part and Part 33 (about capital gains and losses) and Subdivision 328C (What is a small business entity), from just after the time you become absolutely entitled to a *CGT asset as against the trustee of a trust (disregarding any legal disability), the asset is treated as being your asset (instead of being an asset of the trust).

    * (2) This Part, Part 33 and Subdivision 328C apply, from just after the time you become absolutely entitled to a *CGT asset as against the trustee of a trust (disregarding any legal disability), to an act done in relation to the asset by the trustee as if the act had been done by you (instead of by the trustee).

          * Example: An individual becomes absolutely entitled to a CGT asset of a trust. The trustee later sells the asset. Any capital gain or loss from the sale is made by the individual, not the trustee.

##### Subdivision 106D--Securities, charges and encumbrances

##### Table of sections

       * 10660	Securities, charges and encumbrances

##### 10660  Securities, charges and encumbrances

    * (1) For the purposes of this Part and Part 33 (about capital gains and losses) and Subdivision 328C (What is a small business entity):

      * (a) the vesting of a *CGT asset in an entity is ignored, if:

        * (i) the vesting is for the purpose of enforcing, giving effect to or maintaining a security, charge or encumbrance over the asset; and

        * (ii) the security, charge or encumbrance remains over the asset just after the vesting; and

      * (b) a CGT asset is treated as vesting in an entity at the time a security, charge or encumbrance ceases to be over the asset, if:

        * (i) the entity holds the asset just after that time because the asset vested in the entity at an earlier time; and

        * (ii) that earlier vesting was ignored under paragraph (a) because it was for the purpose of enforcing, giving effect to or maintaining the security, charge or encumbrance.

    * (2) This Part, Part 33 and Subdivision 328C apply to an act done by an entity (or an *agent of the entity) in relation to a *CGT asset for the purpose of enforcing, giving effect to or maintaining a security, charge or encumbrance over the asset as if the act had been done by the entity that provided the security (instead of by the firstmentioned entity or its agent).

          * Example: A CGT asset of a borrower vests in a lender as security for a loan. No CGT event happens as a result of the vesting.

          * If the borrower fails to make payments on the loan and the lender sells the CGT asset under the security arrangement, any capital gain or loss is made by the borrower, not the lender.

##### Guide to Division 108

##### 1081  What this Division is about

    * This Division defines the various categories of assets that are relevant to working out your capital gains and losses. They are CGT assets, collectables and personal use assets.

    * It also tells you how capital losses from collectables and personal use assets are relevant to working out your net capital gain or loss.

    * It also sets out when land, buildings and capital improvements are taken to be separate CGT assets.

##### Subdivision 108A--What a CGT asset is

##### Table of sections

       * 1085	CGT assets

       * 1087	Interest in CGT assets as joint tenants

##### 1085  CGT assets

    * (1) A **_CGT asset _**is:

      * (a) any kind of property; or

      * (b) a legal or equitable right that is not property.

    * (2) To avoid doubt, these are **_CGT assets_**:

      * (a) part of, or an interest in, an asset referred to in subsection (1);

      * (b) goodwill or an interest in it;

      * (c) an interest in an asset of a partnership;

      * (d) an interest in a partnership that is not covered by paragraph (c).

          * Note 1: Examples of CGT assets are:

            *  	land and buildings;

            *  	shares in a company and units in a unit trust;

            *  	options;

            *  	debts owed to you;

            *  	a right to enforce a contractual obligation;

            *  	foreign currency.

          * Note 2: An asset is not a CGT asset if the asset was last acquired before 26 June 1992 and was not an asset for the purposes of former Part IIIA of the _Income Tax Assessment Act 1936_: see section 1085 of the _Income Tax (Transitional Provisions) Act 1997_.

##### 1087  Interest in CGT assets as joint tenants

    * Individuals who own a *CGT asset as joint tenants are treated as if they each owned a separate CGT asset constituted by an equal interest in the asset and as if each of them held that interest as a tenant in common.

          * Note: Section 12850 contains rules that apply when a joint tenant dies.

##### Subdivision 108B--Collectables

##### Table of sections

       * 10810	Losses from collectables to be offset only against gains from collectables

       * 10815	Sets of collectables

       * 10817	Cost base of a collectable

##### 10810  Losses from collectables to be offset only against gains from collectables

    * (1) In working out your *net capital gain or *net capital loss for the income year, *capital losses from *collectables can be used only to reduce *capital gains from collectables.

          * Note: You choose the order in which you reduce your capital gains from collectables by your capital losses from collectables.

          * Example: Your capital gains from collectables total $200 and your capital losses from collectables total $400. You have other capital gains of $500. You have a net capital gain of $500 and a net capital loss from collectables of $200.

          * The losses from collectables cannot be used to reduce the $500 capital gain.

    * (2) A **_collectable_** is:

      * (a) *artwork, jewellery, an antique, or a coin or medallion; or

      * (b) a rare folio, manuscript or book; or

      * (c) a postage stamp or first day cover;

    * that is used or kept mainly for your (or your *associate's) personal use or enjoyment.

    * (3) These are also **_collectables_**:

      * (a) an interest in any of the things covered by subsection (2); or

      * (b) a debt that arises from any of those things; or

      * (c) an option or right to *acquire any of those things.

          * Note: Collectables acquired for $500 or less are exempt. However, you get an exemption for an interest in one only if the market value of all the interests combined is $500 or less: see Subdivision 118A.

    * (4) If some or all of a *capital loss from a *collectable cannot be applied in an income year, the unapplied amount can be applied in the next income year for which your *capital gains from *collectables exceed your *capital losses (if any) from collectables.

          * Example: You have a capital gain from a collectable for the income year of $200 and a capital loss from another collectable of $600.

          * Your capital loss from one collectable reduces your capital gain from the other to zero. You cannot apply the remaining $400 of the capital loss in this income year, but you can apply it in a later income year.

    * (5) If you have 2 or more unapplied *net capital losses from *collectables, you must apply them in the order you made them.

##### 10815  Sets of collectables

    * (1) This section sets out what happens if:

      * (a) you own *collectables that are a set; and

      * (b) they would ordinarily be *disposed of as a set; and

      * (c) you dispose of them in one or more transactions for the purpose of trying to obtain the exemption in section 11810.

          * Example: You buy a set of 3 books for $900. You apportion the $900 among each book: see section 11230. If the books are of equal value, you have acquired each one for $300.

          * If you dispose of each book individually, you would ordinarily obtain the exemption in section 11810, because you acquired each one for less than $500.

    * (2) The set of *collectables is taken to be a single *collectable and each of your *disposals is a disposal of part of that collectable.

          * Example: To continue the example, the 3 books are taken to be a single collectable. You will not obtain the exemption in section 11810, because you acquired the set for more than $500.

          * You work out if you make a capital gain or loss from a disposal of part of an asset by comparing the capital proceeds from it with the cost base or reduced cost base (as appropriate) of the disposed part.

          * Note 1: Section 11230 tells you how to apportion the cost base and reduced cost base of a CGT asset on a disposal of part of an asset.

          * Note 2: This section does not apply to a collectable you last acquired before 16 December 1995: see section 10815 of the _Income Tax (Transitional Provisions) Act 1997_.

##### 10817  Cost base of a collectable

    * In working out the *cost base of a *collectable, disregard the third element (about costs of ownership).

##### Subdivision 108C--Personal use assets

##### Table of sections 

       * 10820	Losses from personal use assets must be disregarded

       * 10825	Sets of personal use assets

       * 10830	Cost base of a personal use asset

##### 10820  Losses from personal use assets must be disregarded

    * (1) In working out your *net capital gain or *net capital loss for the income year, any *capital loss you make from a *personal use asset is disregarded.

    * (2) A **_personal use asset_** is:

      * (a) a *CGT asset (except a *collectable) that is used or kept mainly for your (or your *associate's) personal use or enjoyment; or

      * (b) an option or right to *acquire a *CGT asset of that kind; or

      * (c) a debt arising from a *CGT event in which the *CGT asset the subject of the event was one covered by paragraph (a); or

      * (d) a debt arising other than:

        * (i) in the course of gaining or producing your assessable income; or

        * (ii) from your carrying on a *business.

          * Note 1: There is an exemption for a personal use asset you acquire for $10,000 or less: see section 11810.

          * Note 2: A debt arising from a CGT event involving a CGT asset kept mainly for your personal use and enjoyment is a personal use asset to prevent any loss arising from the debt being a normal capital loss.

    * (3) A **_personal use asset _**does _not_ include land, a *stratum unit or a building or structure that is taken to be a separate *CGT asset because of Subdivision 108D.

##### 10825  Sets of personal use assets

    * (1) This section sets out what happens if:

      * (a) you own *personal use assets that are a set; and

      * (b) they would ordinarily be *disposed of as a set; and

      * (c) you dispose of them in one or more transactions for the purpose of trying to obtain the exemption in section 11810.

    * (2) The set of *personal use assets is taken to be a single *personal use asset and each of your *disposals is a disposal of part of that asset.

##### 10830  Cost base of a personal use asset

    * In working out the *cost base of a *personal use asset, disregard the third element (about the costs of ownership).

##### Subdivision 108D--Separate CGT assets

##### Guide to Subdivision 108D

##### 10850  What this Subdivision is about

      * For CGT purposes, there are:

### exceptions to the common law principle that what is attached to the land is part of the land; and

#### special rules about buildings and adjacent land; and

### rules about when a capital improvement to a CGT asset is treated as a separate CGT asset.

          * Note: In addition to the circumstances set out in this Subdivision, separate asset treatment can apply under section 124595 (about a rollover for a Crown lease) and section 124725 (about a rollover for a prospecting or mining entitlement).

##### Table of sections

       * 10885	Meaning of improvement threshold

##### Operative provisions

##### 10855  When is a building a separate asset from land?

    * (1) A building or structure on land that you *acquired _on or after_ 20 September 1985 is taken to be a separate *CGT asset from the land if one of these balancing adjustment provisions applies to the building or structure (whether or not there is a balancing adjustment):

      * (a) Subdivision 40D; or

      * (b) section 355315 or 355525 (about R&D).

          * Example: You construct a timber mill building on land you own. The building is subject to a balancing adjustment on its disposal, loss or destruction. It is taken to be a separate CGT asset from the land.

    * (2) A building or structure that is constructed on land that you *acquired _before_ 20 September 1985 is taken to be a separate *CGT asset from the land if:

      * (a) you entered into a contract for the construction on or after that day; or

      * (b) if there is no contract--the construction started on or after that day.

          * Example: You bought a block of land with a building on it on 10 August 1984. On 1 December 1999 you construct another building on the land. The other building is taken to be a separate CGT asset from the land.

##### 10860  Depreciating asset that is part of a building is a separate asset

    * A *depreciating asset that is part of a building or structure is taken to be a separate *CGT asset from the building or structure.

          * Example: You own a factory from which you carry on a business. You install rest rooms for your employees. The plumbing fixtures and fittings are depreciating assets. These are taken to be a separate CGT asset from the factory.

##### 10865  Land adjacent to land acquired before 20 September 1985

    * Land that you *acquire on or after 20 September 1985 that is adjacent to land (the **_original land_**) you acquired before that day is taken to be a separate *CGT asset from the original land if it and the original land are amalgamated into one title.

          * Example: On 1 April 1984 you bought a block of land. On 1 June 1999 you bought another block of land adjacent to the first block. You amalgamate the titles to the 2 blocks into 1 title.

          * The second block is treated as a separate CGT asset. You can make a capital gain or loss from it if you sell the whole area of land.

##### 10870  When is a capital improvement a separate asset?

    * Improvements to land

    * (1) A capital improvement to land is taken to be a separate *CGT asset from the land if one of the balancing adjustment provisions set out in subsection 10855(1) applies to the improvement (whether or not there is a balancing adjustment).

          * Example: You own land that you use for pastoral operations. You build some fences that are destroyed by fire. The fences are depreciating assets and are subject to a balancing adjustment on their destruction under Division 40. The fences are taken to be a separate CGT asset from the land.

    * Unrelated improvements to preCGT assets

    * (2) A capital improvement to a *CGT asset (the **_original asset_**) that you *acquired _before_ 20 September 1985 (that is not related to any other capital improvement to the asset) is taken to be a separate *CGT asset if its *cost base (assuming it were a separate CGT asset) when a CGT event happens (except one that happens because of your death) in relation to the original asset is:

      * (a) more than the *improvement threshold for the income year in which the event happened; and

      * (b) more than 5% of the *capital proceeds from the event.

          * Example: In 1983 you bought a boat. In 1999 you install a new mast (a capital improvement) for $30,000. Later, you sell the boat for $150,000.

          * If the cost base of the improvement in the sale year is $41,000 and the improvement threshold for that year is $96,000, the improvement will not be treated as a separate asset.

          * Note 1: Section 10880 sets out the factors for deciding whether capital improvements are related to each other.

          * Note 2: If the improvement is a separate asset, the capital proceeds from the event must be apportioned between the original asset and the improvement: see section 11640.

    * Related improvements to preCGT assets

    * (3) Capital improvements to a *CGT asset (the **_original asset_**) that you *acquired _before_ 20 September 1985 that are related to each other are taken to be a separate *CGT asset if the total of their *cost bases (assuming each one were a separate CGT asset) when a *CGT event happens in relation to the original asset is:

      * (a) more than the *improvement threshold for the income year in which the event happened; and

      * (b) more than 5% of the *capital proceeds from the event.

          * Note: If the improvements are a separate asset, the capital proceeds from the event must be apportioned between the original asset and the improvements: see section 11640.

    * Some improvements not relevant

    * (4) This section does not apply to a capital improvement:

      * (a) that took place under a contract that you entered into before 20 September 1985; or

      * (b) if there is no contract--that started or occurred before that day.

    * (5) Subsections (2) and (3) do not apply if the capital improvement is made to:

      * (a) a *Crown lease; or

      * (b) a *prospecting entitlement or *mining entitlement; or

      * (c) a *statutory licence; or

      * (d) a *depreciating asset to which Subdivision 124K applies.

          * Note: Section 10875 deals with this situation.

    * (6) This section does not apply to a capital improvement consisting of repairs to or restoration of a *CGT asset *acquired before 20 September 1985 in circumstances where there is a rollover under Subdivision 124B.

##### 10875  Capital improvements to CGT assets for which a rollover may be available

    * (1) This section is relevant only if a *CGT event happens in relation to a *CGT asset that is:

      * (a) a *Crown lease; or

      * (b) a *prospecting entitlement or *mining entitlement; or

      * (c) a *statutory licence; or

      * (d) a *depreciating asset to which Subdivision 124K applies.

    * You must have *acquired it before 20 September 1985.

          * Note: Division 124 treats you as having acquired a CGT asset before that day in some situations.

    * (2) There are possible consequences if there has been one or more capital improvements to:

      * (a) the *CGT asset the subject of the *CGT event; or

      * (b) any *CGT assets of the same kind that were in existence before the CGT asset and came to an end where a rollover was obtained under a provision set out in this table:

          * Note: Rollovers under former sections 160ZWA, 160ZZF, 160ZZPE and 160ZWC of the _Income Tax Assessment Act 1936_ are also relevant: see section 10875 of the _Income Tax (Transitional Provisions) Act 1997_.

          * Example: In 1984 you acquired a commercial fishing licence. In 1986 you paid $62,000 to get an extra right (a capital improvement) attached to the licence.

          * In June 1999 the licence expired and you got a new licence. You obtained a rollover for the old licence expiring. In April 2000 you sold the new fishing licence for $200,000.

    * (3) Any capital improvement that is not related to another capital improvement is taken to be a separate *CGT asset if its *cost base (assuming it were a separate CGT asset) when the *CGT event happens is:

      * (a) more than the *improvement threshold for the income year in which the event happened; and

      * (b) more than 5% of the *capital proceeds from the event.

          * Example: To continue the example, suppose the cost base of the right is $101,000 and the improvement threshold for the 19992000 income year is $96,000.

          * Since the cost base of the right is more than the improvement threshold and more than 5% of the capital proceeds, the right is taken to be a separate CGT asset.

          * Note 1: Section 10880 sets out the factors for deciding whether capital improvements are related to each other.

          * Note 2: If the improvement is a separate asset, the capital proceeds from the event must be apportioned between the asset and the improvement: see section 11640.

    * (4) Any capital improvements that are related to each other are taken to be a separate *CGT asset if the total of their *cost bases (assuming each one were a separate CGT asset) when the *CGT event happens is:

      * (a) more than the *improvement threshold for the income year in which the event happened; and

      * (b) more than 5% of the *capital proceeds from the event.

          * Note: If the improvements are a separate asset, the capital proceeds from the event must be apportioned between the asset and the improvements: see section 11640.

    * (5) This section does not apply to any capital improvement:

      * (a) that took place under a contract that you entered into before 20 September 1985; or

      * (b) if there is no contract--that started or occurred before that day.

##### 10880  Deciding if capital improvements are related to each other

    * In deciding whether capital improvements are related to each other, the factors to be considered include:

      * (a) the nature of the *CGT asset to which the improvements are made; and

      * (b) the nature, location, size, value, quality, composition and utility of each improvement; and

      * (c) whether an improvement depends in a physical, economic, commercial or practical sense on another improvement; and

      * (d) whether the improvements are part of an overall project; and

      * (e) whether the improvements are of the same kind; and

      * (f) whether the improvements are made within a reasonable period of time of each other.

##### 10885  Meaning of improvement threshold

    * (1) The **_improvement threshold_** for the 199798 income year is $89,992.

    * (2) The *improvement threshold is indexed annually.

          * Note: Subdivision 960M shows you how to index amounts.

    * (3) The Commissioner must publish before the beginning of each *financial year the *improvement threshold for that year.

##### 1091  What this Division is about

    * This Division sets out the ways in which you can _acquire_ a CGT asset and the time of acquisition.

    * The time of acquisition is important for indexation, and for the exemption of assets acquired _before_ 20 September 1985.

    * Generally, you _acquire_ a CGT asset when you become its owner. You can also _acquire _a CGT asset:

      *  	 as a result of a CGT event happening: see section 1095; or

      *  	 in other circumstances: see section 10910.

    * This Division also directs you to special acquisition rules in other Divisions.

##### 1095  General acquisition rules

    * (1) In general, you **_acquire_** a *CGT asset when you become its owner. In this case, the time when you *acquire the asset is when you become its owner.

    * (2) This table sets out specific rules for the circumstances in which, and the time at which, you **_acquire_** a *CGT asset as a result of a *CGT event happening.

          * Note: The full list of CGT events is in section 1045.

          * Note 1: For CGT events E1, E2 and E3, if the circumstances specified in the second column of the table happened to an asset before 12 January 1994, there may be no acquisition: see section 1095 of the _Income Tax (Transitional Provisions) Act 1997_.

          * Note 2: The acquisition rule for CGT event E9 in the table does not apply to you as trustee if the agreement to create the trust was made before 12 noon on 12 January 1994: see section 1095 of the _Income Tax (Transitional Provisions) Act 1997_.

##### 10910  When you acquire a CGT asset without a CGT event

       * 1105	Modifications to general rules

       * 11010	Rules about cost base not relevant for some CGT events

##### 1105  Modifications to general rules

    * After you have read the general rules, you need to know if there are any modifications to them. Division 112 lists each situation that may result in a modification and tells you where you can find the detailed provisions for each situation.

##### 11010  Rules about cost base not relevant for some CGT events 

    * This table sets out each CGT event for which you do not need to know what the cost base or reduced cost base of a CGT asset is to work out if you make a capital gain or loss. The section describing the event tells you what amount is relevant instead.

##### 11025  General rules about cost base

    * (1) The **_cost base_** of a *CGT asset consists of 5 elements.

          * Note 1: You need to keep records of each element: see Division 121.

          * Note 2: The cost base is reduced by net input tax credits: see section 10330.

          * Note 3: An amount that makes up all or part of an element of the cost base of an asset may be determined under section 230505, if the amount is provided for acquiring a thing, and you start or cease to have a Division 230 financial arrangement as consideration for the acquisition of the thing.

    * 5 elements of the cost base

    * (2) The first element is the total of:

      * (a) the money you paid, or are required to pay, in respect of *acquiring it; and

      * (b) the *market value of any other property you gave, or are required to give, in respect of acquiring it (worked out as at the time of the acquisition).

          * Note 1: There are special rules for working out when you are required to pay money or give other property: see section 10315.

          * Note 2: This element is replaced with another amount in many situations: see Division 112.

    * (3) The second element is the *incidental costs you incurred. These costs can include giving property: see section 1035.

          * Note: There is one situation to do with options in which the incidental costs relating to the CGT event are modified: see section 11285.

    * (4) The third element is the costs of owning the *CGT asset you incurred (but only if you *acquired the asset after 20 August 1991). These costs include:

      * (a) interest on money you borrowed to acquire the asset; and

      * (b) costs of maintaining, repairing or insuring it; and

      * (c) rates or land tax, if the asset is land; and

      * (d) interest on money you borrowed to refinance the money you borrowed to acquire the asset; and

      * (e) interest on money you borrowed to finance the capital expenditure you incurred to increase the asset's value.

    *  These costs can include giving property: see section 1035.

          * Note: This element does not apply to personal use assets or collectables: see sections 10817 and 10830.

    * (5) The fourth element is capital expenditure you incurred:

      * (a) the purpose or the expected effect of which is to increase or preserve the asset's value; or

      * (b) that relates to installing or moving the asset.

    *  The expenditure can include giving property: see section 1035.

          * Note: There are 3 situations involving leases in which this element is modified: see section 11280.

    * (5A) Subsection (5) does not apply to capital expenditure incurred in relation to goodwill.

    * (6) The fifth element is capital expenditure that you incurred to establish, preserve or defend your title to the asset, or a right over the asset. (The expenditure can include giving property: see section 1035.)

    * Assume a CGT event for purposes of working out cost base at a particular time

    * (12) If:

      * (a) it is necessary to work out the *cost base at a particular time; and

      * (b) a *CGT event does not happen in relation to the asset at or just after that time;

    * assume, for the purpose only of working out the cost base at the particular time, that such an event does happen in relation to the asset at or just after that time.

          * Note 1: For example, in order to apply subsection 11037(1), it is necessary for there to be a CGT event.

          * Note 2: The assumption that a CGT event happens does not have any consequence beyond that stated. For example, it does _not_ mean that the asset is afterwards to be treated as having been acquired at the particular time with a first element of cost base equal to all of its former cost base elements.

##### 11035  Incidental costs

    * (1) There are a number of **_incidental costs_** you may have incurred. Except for the _ninth_, they are costs you may have incurred:

      * (a) to *acquire a *CGT asset; or

      * (b) that relate to a *CGT event.

    * (2) The _first _is remuneration for the services of a surveyor, valuer, auctioneer, accountant, broker, *agent, consultant or legal adviser. However, remuneration for professional advice about the operation of this Act is not included unless it is provided by a *recognised tax adviser.

          * Note: Expenditure for professional advice about taxation incurred before 1 July 1989 does _not_ form part of the cost base of a CGT asset: see section 11035 of the _Income Tax (Transitional Provisions) Act 1997_.

    * (3) The _second _is costs of transfer.

    * (4) The _third _is stamp duty or other similar duty.

    * (5) The _fourth _is:

      * (a) if you *acquired a *CGT asset--costs of advertising or marketing to find a seller; or

      * (b) if a *CGT event happened--costs of advertising or marketing to find a buyer.

    * (6) The _fifth _is costs relating to the making of any valuation or apportionment for the purposes of this Part or Part 33.

    * (7) The _sixth_ is search fees relating to a *CGT asset.

    * (8) The _seventh_ is the cost of a conveyancing kit (or a similar cost).

    * (9) The _eighth_ is borrowing expenses (such as loan application fees and mortgage discharge fees).

    * (10) The _ninth_ is expenditure that:

      * (a) is incurred by the *head company of a *consolidated group or *MEC group to an entity that is not a *member of the group; and

      * (b) reasonably relates to a *CGT asset *held by the head company; and

      * (c) is incurred because of a transaction that is between members of the group.

          * Example: Land is transferred by one company to another company. The companies are members of a consolidated group. Stamp duty is payable as a result of the transaction.

          * The transaction has no taxation consequences because of its intragroup nature.

          * The stamp duty is included in the cost base and reduced cost base of the land.

          * Note: Intragroup assets are not held by the head company because of the operation of subsection 7011(1) (the single entity rule). An example of an intragroup asset is a debt owed by a member of the consolidated group to another member of the group.

    * (11) The _tenth_ is termination or other similar fees incurred as a direct result of your ownership of a *CGT asset ending.

##### 11036  Indexation

    * (1) The **_cost base_** of a *CGT asset *acquired at or before 11.45 am (by legal time in the Australian Capital Territory) on 21 September 1999 also includes indexation of the elements of the cost base (except the third element) if the requirements of Division 114 are met.

    * (2) However, for the purposes of working out the *capital gain of an entity mentioned in an item of the table from a *CGT event happening after 11.45 am (by legal time in the Australian Capital Territory) on 21 September 1999, the **_cost base_** includes indexation only if the entity mentioned in the item chooses that the cost base includes indexation.

          * Note 1: Section 10325 specifies when you must make the choice and provides that the way you prepare your income tax return is evidence of your choice.

          * Note 2: For each CGT asset whose cost base you need to work out, you may either choose to index the expenditure included in the asset's cost base or not make that choice. If you do not choose to index the expenditure, your net capital gain includes only part of your capital gain on the CGT asset as worked out on the basis of the cost base not including indexation and reduced by your capital losses.

    * (3) Also, for the purpose of working out the *capital gain of a *life insurance company from a *CGT event happening after 30 June 2000 in respect of a *CGT asset that is a *complying superannuation/FHSA asset, the **_cost base_** includes indexation only if the life insurance company chooses that the cost base includes indexation.

          * Note: Section 11025 of the _Income Tax (Transitional Provisions) Act 1997 _provides that, in working out the capital gain from a CGT event after 11.45 am on 21 September 1999 and before 1 July 2000 in respect of an asset of a life insurance company or registered organisation, the cost base includes indexation only if the company or organisation chooses it.

##### What does not form part of the cost base

##### 11037  Expenditure forming part of cost base or element

    * (1) If a later provision of this Subdivision says that:

      * (a) certain expenditure does not form part of the *cost base of a *CGT asset; or

      * (b) the cost base is reduced by certain expenditure;

    * the expenditure is initially included in the cost base, which is then reduced by the amount of the expenditure just before a *CGT event happens in relation to the asset.

          * Note: This has the effect of recognising in the cost base any indexed component relating to the expenditure.

    * (2) On the other hand, if such a provision says that:

      * (a) certain expenditure does not form part of one or more _elements _of the *cost base of a *CGT asset; or

      * (b) one or more _elements_ of the cost base are reduced by certain expenditure;

    * the expenditure is never included in the relevant elements of the cost base.

          * Note: This has the effect of _not_ recognising to any extent this expenditure in the cost base.

##### 11038  Exclusions

    * (1) Expenditure does _not_ form part of any element of the **_cost base_** to the extent that section 2654 prevents it being deducted (even if some other provision also prevents it being deducted).

          * Note: Section 2654 prevents deductions for expenditure related to certain offences.

    * (2) Expenditure does _not_ form part of any element of the **_cost base_** to the extent that it is a *bribe to a foreign public official or a *bribe to a public official.

    * (3) Expenditure does _not_ form part of any element of the **_cost base_** to the extent that it is in respect of providing *entertainment.

    * (4) Expenditure does _not_ form part of any element of the **_cost base_** to the extent that section 265 prevents it being deducted (even if some other provision also prevents it being deducted).

          * Note: Section 265 denies deductions for penalties.

    * (5) Expenditure does _not_ form part of any element of the **_cost base_** to the extent that section 2647 prevents it being deducted.

          * Note: Section 2647 denies deductions for the excess of boat expenditure over boat income.

    * (6) Expenditure does _not_ form part of any element of the **_cost base_** to the extent that section 2622 prevents it being deducted.

          * Note: Section 2622 denies deductions for political contributions and gifts.

    * (7) Expenditure does _not_ form any part of any element of the **_cost base_** to the extent that section 2697 prevents it being deducted (even if some other provision also prevents it being deducted).

          * Note: Section 2697 denies deductions for National Disability Insurance Scheme expenditure.

    * (8) Expenditure does not form part of any element of the **_cost base_** to the extent that section 26100 prevents it being deducted.

          * Note: Section 26100 denies deductions for certain expenditure on water infrastructure improvements.

##### 11043  Partnership interests acquired before 7.30 pm on 13 May 1997

    * (1) This section prevents some expenditure from forming part of one or more elements of the *cost base of your interest in a *CGT asset of a partnership if you *acquired the interest at or before 7.30 pm, by legal time in the Australian Capital Territory, on 13 May 1997. (The expenditure mentioned in this section can include giving property: see section 1035.)

(The expenditure mentioned in this section can include giving property: see section 1035.)

          * For the cost base of interests in partnership assets acquired after that time, see section 11050.

          * For exceptions to the application of this section, see section 11053.

    * (1A) This section also applies to expenditure incurred after 30 June 1999 on land or a building if:

      * (a) the land or building was *acquired at or before the time mentioned in subsection (1); and

    * (4) The **_cost base_** is reduced to the extent that you have deducted or can deduct for an income year capital expenditure incurred by another entity in respect of the *CGT asset. (This rule does not apply so far as the deduction is covered by paragraph (2)(a) or (b).) 

          * Example: Under Division 43 you can deduct expenditure incurred by a previous owner of capital works you own.

    * Landcare and water facility expenditure giving rise to a tax offset

    * (5) Expenditure does _not_ form part of the **_cost base_** to the extent that you choose a *tax offset for it under the former section 38855 (about the landcare and water facility tax offset) instead of deducting it.

    * Heritage conservation expenditure giving rise to a tax offset

    * (6) Expenditure does _not_ form part of the **_cost base_** to the extent that:

        * (i) Division 43 of this Act;

        * (ii) former Division 10C or 10D of Part III of that Act;

      * but for the exclusions in paragraph 4370(2)(h) of this Act and former subsections 124ZB(4) and 124ZG(5) of that Act.

          * Note: Because eligible heritage conservation expenditure is the subject of a tax offset, it is also not deductible.

##### 11050  Partnership interests acquired after 7.30 pm on 13 May 1997

    * (1) This section prevents some expenditure from forming part of the *cost base, or of an element of the cost base, of your interest in a *CGT asset of a partnership if you *acquired the interest after 7.30 pm, by legal time in the Australian Capital Territory, on 13 May 1997. (The expenditure mentioned in this section can include giving property: see section 1035.)

      * (a) the deduction has been reversed by an amount being included in your assessable income for an income year, or in the assessable income of a partnership in which you are or were a partner, by a provision of this Act (outside this Part and Part 33 and Division 243); or

            * Note: Division 20 contains some of the provisions that reverse deductions. Section 205 lists some others.

      * (ab) the deduction is under Division 243; or

      * (b) the deduction would have been so reversed apart from a provision listed in the table in subsection 11045(2) (relief from including a balancing charge in your assessable income).

        * (i) Division 43 of this Act;

        * (ii) former Division 10C or 10D of Part III of that Act;

      * but for the exclusions in paragraph 4370(2)(h) of this Act and former subsections 124ZB(4) and 124ZG(5) of that Act.

          * Note: Because eligible heritage conservation expenditure is the subject of a tax offset, it is also not deductible.

##### 11053  Exceptions to application of sections 11045 and 11050

    * (1) Subsection 11045(2), (4), (5) or (6) or 11050(2), (4), (5) or (6) does not prevent expenditure from forming part of the **_cost base_** to the extent that the deduction mentioned in that subsection could reasonably be regarded as arising before 7.30 pm, by legal time in the Australian Capital Territory, on 13 May 1997, or as relating to a period before that time.

    * (2) Subsections 11045(5) and (6) and 11050(5) and (6) do not apply to expenditure incurred before the day on which the Bill that became the _Taxation Laws Amendment Act (No. 1) 1999_ was introduced into the House of Representatives.

##### 11054  Debt deductions disallowed by thin capitalisation rules

    * Expenditure does _not_ form part of the third element of the **_cost base _**to the extent that Division 820 (Thin capitalisation rules) prevented or prevents you, or a partnership in which you are or were a partner, from deducting it.

##### Subdivision 110B--Reduced cost base

##### Table of sections

       * 11055	General rules about _reduced cost base_

       * _11060	Reduced cost base for partnership assets

##### 11055  General rules about reduced cost base

    * (1) The **_reduced cost base _**of a *CGT asset consists of 5 elements. It does _not_ include indexation of those elements.

          * Note: The reduced cost base is reduced by net input tax credits: see section 10330.

    * 5 elements of the reduced cost base

    * (2) All of the elements (except the third one) of the **_reduced cost base_** of a *CGT asset are the same as those for the *cost base.

    * (3) The third element is:

      * (a) any amounts worked out under whichever of the following subparagraphs applies:

        * (i) if Division 58 does not apply to the asset--any amount included in your assessable income for any income year because of a balancing adjustment for the asset; 

        * (ii) if Division 58 applies to the asset and an amount has been included in your assessable income for an income year because of a balancing adjustment for the asset--any part of that amount that was attributable to amounts you have deducted or can deduct for the decline in value of the asset; and

      * (b) any amount that would have been so included apart from any of these (which provide relief from including a balancing charge in your assessable income):

        * (i) section 40365; or

        * (ii) any of these former sections--section 42285, 42290 or 42293; or

        * (iii) former subsection 59(2A) or (2D) of the _Income Tax Assessment Act 1936_.

    * What does not form part of the reduced cost base

    * (4) The **_reduced cost base _**does not include an amount to the extent that you have deducted or can deduct it (including because of a balancing adjustment) or could have deducted apart from paragraph 4370(2)(h).

          * Note: That paragraph excludes from deductibility under Division 43 expenditure that qualifies for the heritage conservation rebate.

    * (5) The **_reduced cost base_** does not include an amount that you could have deducted for a *CGT asset had you used it wholly for the *purpose of producing assessable income.

    * (6) Expenditure does _not_ form part of the **_reduced cost base_** to the extent of any amounts you have received as *recoupment of it. However, this rule does not apply to the extent that the amounts are included in your assessable income.

    * (6A) Expenditure does _not_ form part of the **_reduced cost base_** to the extent that you chose a *tax offset for it under the former section 38855 (about the landcare and water facility tax offset) instead of deducting it.

    * (7) If your *CGT asset is a *share in a company, its **_reduced cost base_** is reduced by the amount calculated under subsection (8) if:

      * (aa) you are a *corporate tax entity; and

      * (a) the company makes a distribution to you under an *arrangement; and

      * (b) an amount (the **_attributable amount_**) representing the distribution or part of it is reasonably attributable to profits *derived by the company before you cacquired the share; and

      * (c) you are entitled to a *tax offset under Division 207 on the part of the distribution that is a *dividend (the **_dividend amount_**); and

      * (d) you were a *controller (for CGT purposes) of the company, or an *associate of such a controller, when the arrangement was made or carried out.

    * (8) The amount of the reduction is:

    * (9) The **_reduced cost base_** is to be reduced by any amount that you have deducted or can deduct, or could have deducted except for Subdivision 170D, as a result of a *CGT event that happens in relation to a *CGT asset. However, do not make a reduction for an amount that relates to a cost that could never have formed part of the reduced cost base or is excluded from the reduced cost base as a result of another provision of this section.

    * (9A) Expenditure does _not_ form part of the **_reduced cost base_** to the extent that section 2654 prevents it being deducted (even if some other provision also prevents it being deducted).

          * Note: Section 2654 prevents deductions for expenditure related to certain offences.

    * (9B) Expenditure does _not_ form part of the **_reduced cost base_** to the extent that it is a *bribe to a foreign public official or a *bribe to a public official.

    * (9C) Expenditure does _not_ form part of the **_reduced cost base_** to the extent that it is in respect of providing *entertainment.

    * (9D) Expenditure does _not_ form part of the **_reduced cost base_** to the extent that section 265 prevents it being deducted (even if some other provision also prevents it being deducted).

          * Note: Section 265 denies deductions for penalties.

    * (9E) Expenditure does _not_ form part of the **_reduced cost base_** to the extent that section 2647 prevents it being deducted.

          * Note: Section 2647 denies deductions for the excess of boat expenditure over boat income.

    * (9F) Expenditure does _not_ form part of the **_reduced cost base_** to the extent that section 2622 prevents it being deducted.

          * Note: Section 2622 denies deductions for political contributions and gifts.

    * (9G) Expenditure does not form part of the **_reduced cost base_** to the extent that section 26100 prevents it being deducted.

          * Note: Section 26100 denies deductions for certain expenditure on water infrastructure improvements.

    * (9H) Expenditure does _not_ form any part of any element of the **_reduced cost base_** to the extent that section 2697 prevents it being deducted (even if some other provision also prevents it being deducted).

          * Note: Section 2697 denies deductions for National Disability Insurance Scheme expenditure.

    * Assume a CGT event for purposes of working out reduced cost base at a particular time

    * (10) If:

      * (a) it is necessary to work out the *reduced cost base at a particular time; and

      * (b) a *CGT event does not happen in relation to the asset at or just after that time;

    * assume, for the purpose only of working out the reduced cost base at the particular time, that such an event does happen in relation to the asset at or just after that time.

##### 11060  Reduced cost base for partnership assets

    * (1) The third element of an entity's **_reduced cost base_** for its interest in a *CGT asset of a partnership is the entity's share of:

      * (a) any amounts worked out under whichever of the following subparagraphs applies:

        * (i) if Division 58 does not apply to the asset--any amount included in the assessable income of the partnership for any income year because of a balancing adjustment for the asset; 

        * (ii) if Division 58 applies to the asset and an amount has been included in the assessable income of the partnership for an income year because of a balancing adjustment for the asset--any part of that amount that was attributable to amounts that the partnership has deducted or can deduct for depreciation of the asset; and

      * (b) any amount that would have been so included apart from any of these (which provide relief from including a balancing charge in your assessable income):

        * (i) section 40365; or

        * (ii) any of these former sections--section 42285, 42290 or 42293; or

        * (iii) former subsection 59(2A) or (2D) of the _Income Tax Assessment Act 1936_;

    * calculated according to the entity's share in the partnership net income or net loss.

    * (2) Expenditure does_ not _form part of an entity's **_reduced cost base_** for its interest in a *CGT asset of a partnership to the extent that a partnership in which the entity is or was a partner has deducted or can deduct it (including because of a balancing adjustment), or could have deducted it apart from paragraph 4370(2)(h).

    * (3) Expenditure does _not_ form part of an entity's **_reduced cost base_** for its interest in a *CGT asset of a partnership to the extent that a partnership in which the entity is or was a partner could have deducted an amount for the asset if it had used it wholly for the *purpose of producing assessable income.

    * (4) Expenditure does not form part of an entity's **_reduced cost base_** for its interest in a *CGT asset of a partnership to the extent of any amounts that a partnership in which the entity is or was a partner has received as *recoupment of it and that are not included in the assessable income of the partnership.

    * (4A) Expenditure does _not_ form part of an entity's **_reduced cost base_** for its interest in a *CGT asset of a partnership to the extent that the entity chose a *tax offset for the expenditure under the former section 38855 (about the landcare and water facility tax offset) instead of deducting it.

    * (7) The **_reduced cost base_** of an entity's interest in a *CGT asset of a partnership is to be reduced by the entity's share of any amount that the partnership has deducted or can deduct, or could have deducted except for Subdivision 170D, as a result of a *CGT event that happens in relation to the asset. However, a reduction is not to be made for an amount that relates to a cost that could never have formed part of the reduced cost base or is excluded from the reduced cost base as a result of another provision of this section.

##### Guide to Division 112

##### 1121  What this Division is about

    * This Division tells you the situations that may modify the general rules about the cost base and reduced cost base of a CGT asset.

##### 1125  Discussion of modifications

    * (1) Modifications can occur from the time you acquired the CGT asset to when a CGT event happens in relation to it.

          * Note: You should keep records of the modifications: see Division 121.

    * (2) Most modifications replace the first element (what you paid for a CGT asset) of the cost base and reduced cost base of the asset.

    * (3) Subdivision 112A contains operative provisions setting out the general situations that may result in a modification to the general rules.

    * (4) Subdivision 112B (which is a guide) has a number of tables (each one covering a specialist topic) that tell you each situation that _may_ result in a modification to the general rules.

    * (5) Subdivision 112C (which is a guide) explains what a _replacementasset_ rollover is and how it can modify the cost base or reduced cost base.

    * (6) Subdivision 112D (which is a guide) explains what a _sameasset_ rollover is and how it can modify the cost base or reduced cost base.

    * (7) Section 230505 provides special rules for working out the amount of consideration for an asset if the asset is a *Division 230 financial arrangement or a Division 230 financial arrangement is involved in that consideration.

##### Subdivision 112A--General modifications

##### Table of sections

       * 11215	General rule for replacement modifications

       * 11220	Market value substitution rule

       * 11225	Split, changed or merged assets

       * 11230	Apportionment rules

       * 11235	Assumption of liability rule

       * 11237	Put options

##### 11215  General rule for replacement modifications

    * If a cost base modification replaces an element of the *cost base of a *CGT asset with an amount, this Part and Part 33 apply to you as if you had paid that amount.

          * Example: An individual pays $10,000 to acquire an option. The individual dies and the option devolves to his legal personal representative, who exercises the option.

          * Section 1341 applies to the legal personal representative as if the representative had paid $10,000 for the option.

##### 11220  Market value substitution rule

    * (1) The first element of your *cost base and *reduced cost base of a *CGT asset you *acquire from another entity is its *market value (at the time of acquisition) if:

      * (a) you did not incur expenditure to acquire it, except where your acquisition of the asset resulted from:

        * (i) *CGT event D1 happening; or

        * (ii) another entity doing something that did not constitute a CGT event happening; or

      * (b) some or all of the expenditure you incurred to acquire it cannot be valued; or

      * (c) you did not deal at *arm's length with the other entity in connection with the acquisition.

    *  The expenditure can include giving property: see section 1035.

    * (2) Despite paragraph (1)(c), if:

      * (a) you did not deal at *arm's length with the other entity; and

      * (b) your *acquisition of the *CGT asset resulted from another entity doing something that did not constitute a CGT event happening;

    * the *market value is substituted only if what you paid to acquire the CGT asset was more than its market value (at the time of acquisition).

    *  The payment can include giving property: see section 1035.

    * (3) There are some situations in which the rule in subsection (1) does not apply. They include the situations set out in this table:

          * Note 1: Disregard subsections (2) and (3) for shares or units that you acquired before 16 August 1989: see section 11220 of the _Income Tax (Transitional Provisions) Act 1997_.

          * Note 2: This section does not apply to ESS interests acquired under employee share schemes: see subsection 13080(4).

##### 11225  Split, changed or merged assets

    * Split or changed assets

    * (1) This section sets out what happens if:

      * (a) a *CGT asset (the **_original asset_**) is split into 2 or more assets (the **_new assets_**); or

      * (b) a *CGT asset (also the **_original asset_**) changes in whole or in part into an asset (also the **_new asset_**) of a different nature;

    * and you are the beneficial owner of the original asset and each new asset.

          * Example: You subdivide a block of land into 3 separate blocks. Each of those blocks is a _new asset_.

    * (2) The splitting or change is not a *CGT event.

    * (3) You work out the *cost base and *reduced cost base of each new asset as follows:

        * _Method statement_

        * _Step 1.	Work out each element of the *cost base and *reduced cost base of the original asset at the time of the event referred to in subsection (1).

        * Step 2.	Apportion in a reasonable way each element to each new asset. The result is each corresponding element of the new asset's *cost base and *reduced cost base.

    * Merged assets

    * (4) If 2 or more *CGT assets (the **_original assets_**) are merged into a single asset (the **_new asset_**) and you are the beneficial owner of the original assets and the new asset:

      * (a) the merger is not a *CGT event; and

      * (b) each element of the *cost base and *reduced cost base of the new asset (at the time of the merging) is the sum of the corresponding elements of each original asset.

##### 11230  Apportionment rules

    * Apportionment on acquisition of an asset

    * (1) If you *acquire a *CGT asset because of a transaction and only part of the expenditure you incurred under the transaction relates to the acquisition of the asset, the first element of your *cost base and *reduced cost base of the asset is that part of the expenditure that is reasonably attributable to the acquisition of the asset.

    *  The expenditure can include giving property: see section 1035.

    * Apportionment of expenditure in other elements

    * (1A) If you incur expenditure and only part of it relates to another element of the *cost base or *reduced cost base of a *CGT asset, that element includes that part of the expenditure that is reasonably attributable to that element.

    * Apportionment for CGT asset that was part of another asset

    * (2) The *cost base and *reduced cost base of a *CGT asset is apportioned if a *CGT event happens to some part of the asset, but not to the remainder of it.

          * Note: The full list of CGT events is in section 1045.

    * (3) The *cost base for the *CGT asset representing the part to which the *CGT event happened is worked out using the formula:

    * The *reduced cost base is worked out similarly.

    * (4) The remainder of the *cost base and *reduced cost base of the asset is attributed to the part that remains.

          * Example: You acquire a truck for $24,000 and sell its motor for $9,000. Suppose the market value of the remainder of the truck is $16,000.

          * Under subsection (3), the cost base of the motor is:

          * Under subsection (4), the cost base of the remainder of the truck is:

    * (5) However, an amount forming part of the *cost base or *reduced cost base of the asset is not apportioned if, on the facts, that amount is wholly attributable to the part to which the *CGT event happened or to the remaining part.

##### 11235  Assumption of liability rule

    * If you *acquire a *CGT asset from another entity that is subject to a liability, the first element of your *cost base and *reduced cost base of the asset includes the amount of the liability you assume.

          * Example: You acquire a block of land for $150,000. You pay $50,000 and assume a liability for an outstanding mortgage of $100,000. The first element of your cost base and reduced cost base is $150,000.

          * Note: The first element of cost base is dealt with in subsection 11025(2). The first element of reduced cost base is the same: see subsection 11055(2).

##### 11237  Put options

    * The first element of the *cost base and *reduced cost base of a right to *dispose of a *share in a company that you *acquire as a result of *CGT event D2 happening to the company is the sum of:

      * (a) the amount that is included in your assessable income as ordinary income as a result of your acquisition of the right; and

      * (b) the amount (if any) that you paid to acquire the right.

##### 112100  Effect of this Subdivision

    * This Subdivision is a *Guide.

          * Note: In interpreting an operative provision, a Guide may be considered only for limited purposes: see section 950150.

##### 112105  What is a replacementasset rollover?

    * (1) A **_replacementasset rollover _**allows you to defer the making of a capital gain or a capital loss from one CGT event until a later CGT event happens.

    * (2) It involves your ownership of one CGT asset (the **_original asset_**) ending and you acquiring another one (the **_replacement asset_**).

    * (3) All replacementasset rollovers are set out in the table in section 112115.

##### 112110  How is the cost base of the replacement asset modified?

    * If you acquired the original asset on or after 20 September 1985: 

      * (a) the first element of the replacement asset's cost base is replaced by the original asset's cost base at the time you acquired the replacement asset; and

      * (b) the first element of the replacement asset's reduced cost base is replaced by the original asset's reduced cost base at the time you acquired the replacement asset.

          * Note 1: Some replacementasset rollovers involve other rules that affect the cost base or reduced cost base of the replacement asset.

          * Note 2: If you acquired the original asset before 20 September 1985, you are taken to have acquired the replacement asset before that day: see Subdivision 124A.

          * Note 3: The reduced cost base may be further modified if the replacement asset rollover happens after a demerger: see section 125170.

##### 112115  Table of replacementasset rollovers

    * This table sets out all the replacementasset rollovers and tells you where you can find more detail about each one.

    * Provisions of this Act are in normal text. The other provisions, **in bold**, are provisions of the _Income Tax Assessment Act 1936_.

##### 112135  Effect of this Subdivision

    * This Subdivision is a *Guide.

          * Note: In interpreting an operative provision, a Guide may be considered only for limited purposes: see section 950150.

##### 112140  What is a sameasset rollover?

    * A **_sameasset rollover _**allows one entity (the **_transferor_**) to disregard a capital gain or loss it makes from disposing of a CGT asset to, or creating a CGT asset in, another entity (the **_transferee_**). Any gain or loss is deferred until another CGT event happens in relation to the asset (in the hands of the transferee).

    * All sameasset rollovers are set out in the table in section 112150.

##### 112145  How is the cost base of the asset modified?

    * If the transferor acquired the asset on or after 20 September 1985: 

      * (a) the first element of the asset's cost base (in the hands of the transferee) is replaced by the asset's cost base at the time the transferee acquired it; and

      * (b) the first element of the asset's reduced cost base (in the hands of the transferee) is replaced by the asset's reduced cost base at the time the transferee acquired it.

          * Note 1: If the transferor acquired the asset before 20 September 1985, the transferee is taken to have acquired it before that day: see Subdivision 126A.

          * Note 2: The reduced cost base may be further modified if the same asset rollover happens after a demerger: see section 125170.

##### 112150  Table of sameasset rollovers

    * This table sets out all the sameasset rollovers and tells you where you can find more detail about each one.

       * 11410	Requirement for 12 months ownership

       * 11415	Cost base modifications

       * 11420	When expenditure is incurred for rollovers

##### 1141  Indexing elements of cost base

    * In working out the *cost base of a *CGT asset *acquired at or before 11.45 am (by legal time in the Australian Capital Territory) on 21 September 1999, index expenditure incurred at or before that time in each element. (The expenditure can include giving property: see section 1035).

          * Note 1: Subdivision 960M shows you how to index amounts. The indexation does not take account of inflation after 30 September 1999.

          * Note 2: You have to work out the cost base of a CGT asset if a CGT event happens in relation to it or if there is a cost base modification.

          * Note 3: You cannot index expenditure in the third element (costs of ownership): see subsection 960275(4).

          * Note 4: Indexation is not relevant to expenditure incurred after 11.45 am on 21 September 1999 or any expenditure relating to a CGT asset acquired after that time.

          * Example: Peter purchases a building as an investment on 1 January 1994 for $250,000. This amount forms the first element of his cost base.

          * He sold the building on 1 February 1996.

          * The index number for the quarter in which he sold the building (the March quarter 1996) is 119.0. The index number for the quarter in which he purchased the building (the March quarter 1994) is 110.4.

          * Applying section 960275, work out the indexation factor as follows:

          * The indexed first element of Peter's cost base is:

##### 1145  When indexation relevant

    * (1) Indexation is only relevant if the *cost base of a *CGT asset is relevant to a *CGT event.

          * Note 1: The table in section 11010 sets out the CGT events for which cost base is not relevant.

          * Note 2: Indexation is not relevant to the reduced cost base of a CGT asset.

    * Indexation for some entities only if indexation chosen

    * (2) Indexation is _not_ relevant to the *capital gain of an entity mentioned in an item of the table from a *CGT event happening after 11.45 am (by legal time in the Australian Capital Territory) on 21 September 1999, unless the relevant entity mentioned in that item has chosen that the *cost base include indexation:

    * (3) Indexation is _not_ relevant to the *capital gain of a *life insurance company from a *CGT event happening after 30 June 2000 in respect of a *CGT asset that is a *complying superannuation/FHSA asset unless the company has chosen that the *cost base include indexation.

          * Note: Section 1145 of the _Income Tax (Transitional Provisions) Act 1997_ provides that indexation is not relevant to the capital gain of a life insurance company or registered organisation from a CGT event after 11.45 am on 21 September 1999 and before 1 July 2000 unless the company or organisation chooses it.

##### 11410  Requirement for 12 months ownership

    * (1) You only index expenditure in the *cost base of a *CGT asset for a *CGT event happening in relation to the asset if you, or the entity whose cost base is being worked out, had *acquired the asset at or before 11.45 am (by legal time in the Australian Capital Territory) on 21 September 1999 and at least 12 months before the time of that *CGT event.

          * Note: Generally, expenditure is indexed from when it is incurred: see subsection 960275(2). The exception is when there is an acquisition that did not result from a CGT event. The first element in this case is indexed from when the expenditure was paid: see subsection 960275(3).

    * (2) There are 5 exceptions:

       *  	one for *CGT event E8: see subsection (3); and

       *  	 one for rollovers: see subsections (4) and (5); and

       *  	 one for deceased estates: see subsection (6); and

       *  	 one for a surviving joint tenant: see subsection (7); and

       *  	one for *CGT event J1: see subsection (8).

    * CGT event E8

    * (3) For *CGT event E8, the beneficiary indexes the *cost bases of the *CGT assets of the trust only if the beneficiary *acquired the *CGT asset that is the interest in the trust capital at least 12 months before *disposing of it.

    * It does not matter (for indexation from the beneficiary's point of view) how long the trustee owned any of the assets of the trust.

    * Same asset rollovers

    * (4) The 12 month rule is satisfied for both the entity that owned a *CGT asset before a *sameasset rollover and the entity that owned it after the rollover if the sum of their periods of ownership of the asset (and the sum of the periods of ownership of the asset of other entities involved in an unbroken series of rollovers) is at least 12 months.

    * Replacement asset rollovers

    * (5) The 12 month rule is satisfied for an entity obtaining a *replacementasset rollover for a *CGT event happening in relation to a *CGT asset if the period of the entity's ownership of the original asset (and of other assets for an unbroken series of replacementasset rollovers) and of the replacement asset are together at least 12 months.

          * Example: Company A transfers a CGT asset to Company B (which is a member of the same whollyowned group and a foreign resident) 5 months after acquiring it. There is a rollover for the transfer under Subdivision 126B.

          * Company B sells the asset 8 months after the transfer.

          * Company A indexes expenditure in its cost base up to the transfer. That cost base becomes the first element of Company B's cost base. Company B indexes its cost base from the transfer to the sale.

    * Deceased estates

    * (6) If a *CGT asset you owned just before dying devolves to your *legal personal representative or *passes to a beneficiary in your estate, the 12 month rule applies to the legal personal representative or the beneficiary as if that entity had *acquired the asset when you acquired it.

    * Surviving joint tenant

    * (7) If individuals own a *CGT asset as joint tenants and one of them dies, the 12 month rule applies to the surviving joint tenant as if the surviving joint tenant had *acquired the deceased's interest in the asset when the deceased acquired it.

          * Note: The surviving joint tenant is taken to have acquired the deceased's interest in the asset: see section 12850.

    * CGT event J1

    * (8) If *CGT event J1 happens, the company that owns the rollover asset ignores (for indexation purposes) the acquisition rule in subsection 104175(8).

##### 11415  Cost base modifications

    * (1) There are a number of modifications to the *cost base of *CGT assets (see sections 11220 and 11235 and Subdivisions 112B, 112C and 112D). These affect the way indexation works.

    * (2) If a cost base modification replaces an element of the *cost base of a *CGT asset with an amount, or includes an amount in such an element, you index the element or the amount as if expenditure equal to the amount had been incurred in the *quarter in which the modification occurred.

          * Example: A trust is declared over a CGT asset (an example of CGT event E1). The first element of the cost base in the hands of the trustee is its market value. The trustee indexes that market value from the quarter in which the trust was declared.

    * (3) A different rule applies if a cost base modification reduces the _total _*cost base of a *CGT asset.

Method statement

        * Step 1.	Work out the *cost base (all elements) of the asset as at the *quarter in which the modification occurred.

        * Step 2.	Subtract the amount of the reduction.

        * Step 3.	The Step 2 amount forms a new first element of your *cost base, and is later indexed as if you had incurred expenditure equal to that amount in the *quarter in which the modification occurred.

          * Example: Margaret receives a capital payment of $1,000 for shares (an example of CGT event G1). The first element of her cost base is $10,250 (indexed to the quarter in which the payment was made) and the second element (similarly indexed) is $210. Add those amounts ($10,460) and subtract the $1,000. Her new first element of the cost base is $9,460. There are no other elements at that time.

    * (4) Despite subsection (2), there are different rules for the exercise of an option or the conversion of a *convertible interest.

    * Exercise of options

    * (5) The amount you paid for the option, and the amount you paid to exercise it, are indexed from the *quarter in which the liabilities to pay the amounts were incurred.

          * Example: On 1 April 1997, Robyn grants Andrew an option to buy land she owns. The option fee is $10,000, and the option is to buy the land on 30 June 1998 for $100,000.

          * Andrew exercises the option and acquires the land on 30 June 1998. To work out whether there is a capital gain when Andrew disposes of the land, indexation is available if the land is disposed of 12 months or more after its acquisition.

          * The $10,000 option fee can be indexed from 1 April 1997 (when the liability to pay it was incurred). The $100,000 exercise price can be indexed from 30 June 1998 (when the liability to pay the price was incurred).

    * Convertible interests

    * (6) If you *acquire *shares in a company or units in a unit trust by converting a *convertible interest, the amount paid for the convertible interest, and the amount paid to convert it, are indexed from the *quarter in which the liabilities to pay the amounts were incurred.

          * Note: If shares or units are acquired as a result of the exercise of the option or the conversion of the convertible interest, and an amount is paid to the company or trust on the shares or units after the day of acquisition, that amount is indexed from the time it is paid: see subsection 960275(3).

##### 11420  When expenditure is incurred for rollovers

    * If there is a rollover for a *CGT event happening in relation to a *CGT asset and the first element of the *cost base of the asset is the whole of the cost base of:

      * (a) for a *replacementasset rollover, the original asset; or

      * (b) for a *sameasset rollover, the CGT asset;

    * you index that element as if expenditure equal to the amount in that element had been incurred in the *quarter in which the CGT event happened.

##### Guide to Division 115

##### 1151  What this Division is about

    * A discount capital gain remaining after the application of any capital losses and net capital losses from previous income years is reduced by the discount percentage when working out your net capital gain.

    * A capital gain from a CGT asset is a discount capital gain only if the entity making the gain acquired the asset at least a year before the CGT event causing the gain and no choice has been made to include indexation in the cost base of the asset.

    * Special rules apply to the net income of trusts with net capital gains, to ensure that the appropriate discount percentage is applied and to let beneficiaries apply their capital losses against their share of the trust's capital gains.

    * Special rules apply to certain capital gains made by listed investment companies to enable shareholders receiving dividends that include these gains to obtain benefits similar to those conferred by the CGT discount.

##### What is a discount capital gain?

##### 1155  What is a discount capital gain?

    * A **_discount capital gain_** is a *capital gain that meets the requirements of sections 11510, 11515, 11520 and 11525.

          * Note: Sections 11540, 11545 and 77570 identify capital gains that are _not_ discount capital gains, despite this section.

##### 11510  Who can make a discount capital gain?

    * To be a *discount capital gain, the *capital gain must be made by:

      * (a) an individual; or

      * (b) a *complying superannuation entity; or

      * (c) a trust; or

      * (d) a *life insurance company in relation to a *discount capital gain from a *CGT event in respect of a *CGT asset that is a *complying superannuation/FHSA asset.

##### 11515  Discount capital gain must be made after 21 September 1999

    * To be a *discount capital gain, the *capital gain must result from a *CGT event happening after 11.45 am (by legal time in the Australian Capital Territory) on 21 September 1999.

##### 11520  Discount capital gain must not have indexed cost base

    * (1) To be a *discount capital gain, the *capital gain must have been worked out:

      * (a) using a *cost base that has been calculated without reference to indexation at any time; or

      * (b) for a capital gain that arose under *CGT event K7--using the *cost of the *depreciating asset concerned.

          * Note: A listed investment company must also calculate capital gains without reference to indexation in order to allow its shareholders to access the concessions in Subdivision 115D.

    * (2) For the purposes of working out whether the *capital gain is a *discount capital gain and the amount of that gain, the *cost base taken into account in working out the capital gain may be recalculated without reference to indexation if the cost base had an element including indexation because of another provision of this Act. This subsection has effect despite that other provision.

          * Note: This lets a capital gain of an entity (the **_gain entity_**) on a CGT asset be a discount capital gain even if:

            * (a) another provision of this Act (such as a provision for a sameasset rollover or Division 128) set the gain entity's cost base for the asset by reference to the cost base for the asset when it was owned by another entity (the **_earlier owner_**), and the earlier owner's cost base for the asset included indexation; or

            * (b) another provision of this Act (such as a provision for a replacementasset rollover) set the cost base of the asset by reference to the cost base of the original asset involved in the rollover, and the original asset's cost base included indexation.

          * Example: In 1995 Elizabeth acquired land from her exhusband under an order made by a court under the _Family Law Act 1975_. Former section 160ZZM of the _Income Tax Assessment Act 1936_ treated her as having paid $56,000 for the land, equal to her exhusband's _indexed_ cost base for it. His cost base for the land then was $40,000.

          * In 2000, she sold the land for capital proceeds of $150,000.

          * Her discount capital gain on the land is $110,000 (equal to the capital proceeds less the cost base for the land without indexation).

    * (3) This section does not apply to a *capital gain worked out under subsection 104255(3) (about carried interests).

##### 11525  Discount capital gain must be on asset acquired at least 12 months before

    * (1) To be a *discount capital gain, the *capital gain must result from a *CGT event happening to a *CGT asset that was *acquired by the entity making the capital gain at least 12 months before the CGT event.

          * Note 1: Even if the capital gain results from a CGT event happening at least a year after the CGT asset was acquired, the gain may not be a discount capital gain, depending on the cause of the CGT event (see section 11540) and the nature of the asset (see sections 11545 and 11550).

          * Note 2: Section 11530 or 11534 may affect the time when the entity is treated as having acquired the CGT asset.

    * (2) To avoid doubt, subsection (1) applies to the *CGT asset shown in the table for a *CGT event listed in the table.

    * (2A) If the *capital gain results from a *CGT event K9 happening:

      * (a) subsection (1) does not apply; and

      * (b) to be a *discount capital gain, the *carried interest to which the CGT event relates must arise under a partnership agreement entered into at least 12 months before the CGT event.

    * (3) A *capital gain from one of these *CGT events is _not_ a **_discount capital gain_** (despite section 1155):

      * (a) *CGT event D1;

      * (b) *CGT event D2;

      * (c) *CGT event D3;

      * (d) *CGT event E9;

      * (e) *CGT event F1;

      * (f) *CGT event F2;

      * (g) *CGT event F5;

      * (h) *CGT event H2;

      * (ha) *CGT event J2;

      * (hb) *CGT event J5;

      * (hc) *CGT event J6;

      * (i) *CGT event K10.

          * Note: Capital gains from the CGT events mentioned in paragraphs (3)(a) to (f) are not discount capital gains because the CGT asset involved in the CGT event comes into existence at the time of the event, so it is impossible to meet the requirement in this section that the asset have been acquired at least 12 months before the event.

##### 11530  Special rules about time of acquisition

    * Entity is treated as acquiring some CGT assets early

    * (1) Sections 11525, 11540, 11545, 115105, 115110 and 115115 (the **_affected sections_**) apply as if an entity (the **_acquirer_**) had acquired a *CGT asset described in an item of the table at the time mentioned in the item:

          * Note: Under section 12850, the acquirer is taken to acquire the interest of a deceased individual in a CGT asset the acquirer and the deceased held as joint tenants immediately before the deceased's death (or an equal share of that interest if there are other surviving joint tenants).

    * (1A) For the purposes of sections 115105, 115110 and 115115, item 2 of the table in subsection (1) applies in relation to all *replacementasset rollovers, including those covered by paragraph 11534(1)(c).

    * CGT event E8

    * (2) For the purposes of applying sections 11525 and 11540 in relation to *CGT event E8 and the *CGT asset consisting of a beneficiary's interest in trust capital, it does not matter how long the trustee owned any of the assets of the trust.

          * Note: Section 11545 limits the effect of this subsection in some cases.

    * Relationship with Subdivision 109A and Division 128

    * (3) This section has effect despite Subdivision 109A and Division 128 (which contain rules about the time when you *acquire a *CGT asset).

##### 11532  Special rule about time of acquisition for certain replacementasset rollovers

    * (1) This section applies if:

      * (a) a *CGT event happens to:

        * (i) your *share in a company; or

        * (ii) your *trust voting interest, unit or other fixed interest in a trust; and

      * (b) you *acquired the share or interest as a replacement asset for a *replacementasset rollover (other than a rollover covered by paragraph 11534(1)(c)); and

      * (c) at the time of the CGT event, the company or trust:

        * (i) owns a *membership interest in an entity (the **_original entity_**); and

        * (ii) has owned that membership interest for less than 12 months; and

      * (d) that membership interest is the original asset for the rollover.

          * Note: This section does not affect the time when you are treated as having acquired the replacement asset. That time is worked out under item 2 of the table in subsection 11530(1).

    * Application of tests about the assets of the company or trust

    * (2) Subsection 11545(4) applies as if the company or trust had *acquired the original asset at least 12 months before the *CGT event, if the condition in that subsection would not be met were it to be applied to the original entity and the CGT event.

    * (3) Subsection 11545(6) applies as if the company or trust had *acquired the original asset at least 12 months before the *CGT event, if the condition in subsection 11545(5) would not be met were it to be applied to the original entity and the CGT event.

##### 11534  Further special rule about time of acquisition for certain replacementasset rollovers

    * (1) This section applies if:

      * (a) a *CGT event happens to your *share in a company; and

      * (b) at the time of the CGT event, you had owned the share for less than 12 months; and

      * (c) you *acquired the share as a replacement asset for:

        * (i) a *replacementasset rollover under Subdivision 122A (disposal of assets by individuals or trustees to a whollyowned company) for which you *disposed of a *CGT asset, or all the assets of a *business, to the company; or

        * (ii) a replacementasset rollover under Subdivision 122B (disposal of assets by partners to a whollyowned company) for which you disposed of your interests in a CGT asset, or your interests in all the assets of a business, to the company; or

        * (iii) a replacementasset rollover under Subdivision 124N (disposal of assets by trusts to a company) for which a trust of which you were a beneficiary disposed of all of its CGT assets to the company.

    * Application of tests about when you acquired the share

    * (2) Sections 11525 and 11540 apply as if you had *acquired the *share at least 12 months before the *CGT event.

    * Application of tests about the company's assets

    * (3) For each asset mentioned in subparagraph (1)(c)(i), subsections 11545(4) and (6) apply as if the company had *acquired that asset when you acquired it.

    * (4) For each asset mentioned in subparagraph (1)(c)(ii), subsections 11545(4) and (6) apply as if the company had *acquired that asset when you acquired your interests in it.

    * (5) For each asset mentioned in subparagraph (1)(c)(iii), subsections 11545(4) and (6) apply as if the company had *acquired that asset when the trust acquired it.

    * Relationship with Subdivision 109A

    * (6) This section has effect despite Subdivision 109A (which contains rules about the time of acquisition of CGT assets).

##### What are not discount capital gains?

##### 11540  Capital gain resulting from agreement made within a year of acquisition

    * Your *capital gain on a *CGT asset from a *CGT event is _not_ a **_discount capital gain_** (despite section 1155) if the CGT event occurred under an agreement you made within 12 months of *acquiring the CGT asset.

          * Note: Section 11530 or 11534 may affect the time when you are treated as having acquired the CGT asset.

##### 11545  Capital gain from equity in an entity with newly acquired assets

    * Purpose of this section

    * (1) The purpose of this section is to deny you a *discount capital gain on your *share in a company or interest in a trust if you would _not_ have had *discount capital gains on the majority of *CGT assets (by cost and by value) underlying the share or interest if:

      * (a) you had owned them for the time the company or trust did; and

      * (b) *CGT events had happened to them when the CGT event happened to your share or interest.

    * When a capital gain is not a discount capital gain

    * (2) Your *capital gain from a *CGT event happening to:

      * (a) your *share in a company; or

      * (b) your *trust voting interest, unit or other fixed interest in a trust;

    * is _not_ a **_discount capital gain_** if the 3 conditions in subsections (3), (4) and (5) are met. This section has effect despite section 1155 and subsection 11530(2).

          * Note: This section does not prevent a capital gain from being a discount capital gain if there are at least 300 members or beneficiaries of the company or trust and control of the company or trust is not and cannot be concentrated (see section 11550).

    * You had at least 10% of the equity in the entity before the event

    * (3) The first condition is that, just before the *CGT event, you and your *associates beneficially owned:

      * (a) at least 10% by value of the *shares in the company (except shares that carried a right only to participate in a distribution of profits or capital to a limited extent); or

      * (b) at least 10% of the *trust voting interests, issued units or other fixed interests (as appropriate) in the trust.

    * Cost bases of new assets are more than 50% of all cost bases of entity's assets

    * (4) The second condition is that the total of the *cost bases of *CGT assets that the company or trust owned at the time of the *CGT event and had *acquired _less_ than 12 months before then is _more_ than half of the total of the *cost bases of the *CGT assets the company or trust owned at the time of the event.

          * Note: Sections 11530 and 11532, or section 11534, may affect the time when the company or trust is treated as having acquired a CGT asset.

    * Net capital gain on entity's new assets would be more than 50% of net capital gain on all the entity's assets

    * (5) The third condition is that the amount worked out under subsection (6) is _more_ than half of the amount worked out under subsection (7).

    * (6) Work out the amount that would be the *net capital gain of the company or trust for the income year if:

      * (a) just before the *CGT event, the company or trust had *disposed of all of the *CGT assets that it owned then and had *acquired less than 12 months before the *CGT event; and

      * (b) it had received the *market value of those assets for the disposal; and

      * (c) the company or trust did not have any *capital gains or *capital losses from *CGT events other than the disposal; and

      * (d) the company or trust did not have a *net capital loss for an earlier income year.

          * Note: Sections 11530 and 11532, or section 11534, may affect the time when the company or trust is treated as having acquired a CGT asset.

    * (7) Work out the amount that would be the *net capital gain of the company or trust for the income year if:

      * (a) just before the *CGT event, the company or trust had *disposed of all of the *CGT assets that it owned then; and

      * (b) it had received the *market value of those assets for the disposal; and

      * (c) all of the *capital gains and *capital losses from those assets were taken into account in working out the net capital gain, despite any rules providing that one or more of those capital gains or losses are not to be taken into account in working out the net capital gain; and

      * (d) the company or trust did not have any *capital gains or *capital losses from *CGT events other than the disposal; and

      * (e) the company or trust did not have a *net capital loss for an earlier income year.

##### 11550  Discount capital gain from equity in certain entities

    * Capital gain from share in company with 300 members

    * (1) Section 11545 does not prevent a *capital gain from a *CGT event happening to a *share in a company with at least 300 *members from being a *discount capital gain, unless subsection (3) or (6) applies in relation to the company.

    * Capital gain from interest in fixed trust with 300 beneficiaries

    * (2) Section 11545 does not prevent a *capital gain from a *CGT event happening to an interest in a trust from being a *discount capital gain if:

      * (a) entities have *fixed entitlements to all of the income and capital of the trust; and

      * (b) the trust has at least 300 beneficiaries; and

      * (c) neither subsection (4) nor subsection (6) applies in relation to the trust.

    * No discount capital gain if ownership is concentrated

    * (3) Section 11545 may prevent a *capital gain from a *share in a company from being a *discount capital gain if an individual owns, or up to 20 individuals own between them, directly or indirectly (through one or more interposed entities) and for their own benefit, *shares in the company:

      * (a) carrying *fixed entitlements to:

        * (i) at least 75% of the company's income; or

        * (ii) at least 75% of the company's capital; or

      * (b) carrying at least 75% of the voting rights in the company.

    * (4) Section 11545 may prevent a *capital gain from an interest in a trust from being a *discount capital gain if an individual owns, or up to 20 individuals own between them, directly or indirectly (through one or more interposed entities) and for their own benefit, interests in the trust:

      * (a) carrying *fixed entitlements to:

        * (i) at least 75% of the trust's income; or

        * (ii) at least 75% of the trust's capital; or

      * (b) if beneficiaries of the trust have a right to vote in respect of activities of the trust--carrying at least 75% of those voting rights.

    * (5) Subsections (3) and (4) operate as if all of these were a single individual:

      * (a) an individual, whether or not the individual holds *shares in the company or interests in the trust (as appropriate);

      * (b) the individual's *associates;

      * (c) for any *shares or interests in respect of which other individuals are nominees of the individual or of the individual's associates--those other individuals.

    * No discount capital gain if rights can be varied to concentrate ownership

    * (6) Section 11545 may prevent a *capital gain from a *share in a company, or from an interest in a trust, from being a *discount capital gain if, because of anything listed in subsection (7), it is reasonable to conclude that the rights attaching to any of the *shares in the company or interests in the trust (as appropriate) _can be_ varied or abrogated in such a way that subsection (3) or (4) would be satisfied.

    * (7) These are the things:

      * (a) any provision in the constituent document of the company or trust, or in any contract, agreement or instrument:

        * (i) authorising the variation or abrogation of rights attaching to any of the *shares in the company or interests in the trust (as appropriate); or

        * (ii) relating to the conversion, cancellation, extinguishment or redemption of any of those shares or interests;

      * (b) any contract, *arrangement, option or instrument under which a person has power to acquire any of those shares or interests;

      * (c) any power, authority or discretion in a person in relation to the rights attaching to any of those shares or interests.

    * (8) It does not matter for the purposes of subsection (6) whether or not the rights attaching to any of the *shares or interests _are_ varied or abrogated in the way described in that subsection.

##### 11555  Capital gains involving money received from demutualisation of friendly society health or life insurer

    * Your *capital gain from a *CGT event is _not_ a **_discount capital gain_** if it is affected by section 31660 or 316165.

          * Note: Those sections affect capital gains involving the receipt of money as a result of the demutualisation of a friendly society health or life insurer.

##### Subdivision 115C--Rules about trusts with net capital gains

##### Guide to Subdivision 115C

##### 115200  What this Division is about

    * This Subdivision sets out rules for dealing with the net income of a trust that has a net capital gain. The rules treat parts of the net income attributable to the trust's net capital gain as capital gains made by the beneficiary entitled to those parts. This lets the beneficiary reduce those parts by any capital losses and unapplied net capital losses it has.

    * If the trust's capital gain was reduced by either the general 50% discount in step 3 of the method statement in subsection 1025(1) or by the small business 50% reduction in Subdivision 152C (but not both), then the gain is doubled. The beneficiary can then apply its capital losses to the gain before applying the appropriate discount percentage (if any) or the small business 50% reduction.

    * If the trust's capital gain was reduced by both the general 50% discount and the small business 50% reduction, then the gain is multiplied by 4. The beneficiary can then apply its capital losses to the gain before applying the appropriate discount percentage (if any) and the small business 50% reduction.

    * Division 6E of Part III of the _Income Tax Assessment Act 1936_ will exclude amounts from the beneficiary's assessable income if necessary to prevent it from being taxed twice on the same parts of the trust's net income.

       * 115230	Choice for resident trustee to be specifically entitled to capital gain

##### Operative provisions

##### 115210  When this Subdivision applies

    * (1) This Subdivision applies if a trust estate has a *net capital gain for an income year that is taken into account in working out the trust estate's net income (as defined in section 95 of the _Income Tax Assessment Act 1936_) for the income year.

    * (2) If the trust estate has a beneficiary that is a *complying superannuation entity that is a trust, this Subdivision applies in relation to the complying superannuation entity as a beneficiary but not as a trust estate. This Subdivision does not apply otherwise to a *complying superannuation entity that is a trust.

##### 115215  Assessing presently entitled beneficiaries

    * Purpose

    * (1) The purpose of this section is to ensure that appropriate amounts of the trust estate's net income attributable to the trust estate's *capital gains are treated as a beneficiary's capital gains when assessing the beneficiary, so:

      * (a) the beneficiary can apply *capital losses against gains; and

      * (b) the beneficiary can apply the appropriate *discount percentage (if any) to gains.

    * Extra capital gains

    * (3) If you are a beneficiary of the trust estate, for each *capital gain of the trust estate, Division 102 applies to you as if you had:

      * (a) if the capital gain was not reduced under either step 3 of the method statement in subsection 1025(1) (discount capital gains) or Subdivision 152C (small business 50% reduction)--a capital gain equal to the amount mentioned in subsection 115225(1); and

      * (b) if the capital gain was reduced under either step 3 of the method statement or Subdivision 152C but not both (even if it was further reduced by the other small business concessions)--a capital gain equal to twice the amount mentioned in subsection 115225(1); and

      * (c) if the capital gain was reduced under both step 3 of the method statement and Subdivision 152C (even if it was further reduced by the other small business concessions)--a capital gain equal to 4 times the amount mentioned in subsection 115225(1).

          * Note: This subsection does not affect the amount (if any) included in your assessable income under Division 6 of Part III of the _Income Tax Assessment Act 1936_ because of the capital gain of the trust estate_._ However, Division 6E of that Part may have the effect of reducing the amount included in your assessable income under Division 6 of that Part by an amount related to the capital gain you have under this subsection.

    * (4) For each *capital gain of yours mentioned in paragraph (3)(b) or (c):

      * (a) if the relevant trust gain was reduced under step 3 of the method statement in subsection 1025(1)--Division 102 also applies to you as if your capital gain were a *discount capital gain, if you are the kind of entity that can have a discount capital gain; and

      * (b) if the relevant trust gain was reduced under Subdivision 152C--the capital gain remaining after you apply step 3 of the method statement is reduced by 50%.

          * Note: This ensures that your share of the trust estate's net capital gain is taxed as if it were a capital gain you made (assuming you made the same choices about cost bases including indexation as the trustee).

    * (4A) To avoid doubt, subsection (3) treats you as having a *capital gain for the purposes of Division 102, despite section 10220.

    * Section 11820 does not reduce extra capital gains

    * (5) To avoid doubt, section 11820 does not reduce a *capital gain that subsection (3) treats you as having for the purpose of applying Division 102.

##### 115220  Assessing trustees under section 98 of the Income Tax Assessment Act 1936

    * (1) This section applies if:

      * (a) you are the trustee of the trust estate; and

      * (b) on the assumption that there is a share of the income of the trust to which a beneficiary of the trust is presently entitled, you would be liable to be assessed (and pay tax) under section 98 of the _Income Tax Assessment Act 1936_ in relation to the trust estate in respect of the beneficiary.

    * (2) For each *capital gain of the trust estate, increase the amount (the **_assessable amount_**) in respect of which you are actually liable to be assessed (and pay tax) under section 98 of the _Income Tax Assessment Act 1936_ in relation to the trust estate in respect of the beneficiary by:

      * (a) unless paragraph (b) applies--the amount mentioned in subsection 115225(1) in relation to the beneficiary; or

      * (b) if the liability is under paragraph 98(3)(b) or subsection 98(4), and the capital gain was reduced under step 3 of the method statement in subsection 1025(1) (discount capital gains)--twice the amount mentioned in subsection 115225(1) in relation to the beneficiary.

    * (3) To avoid doubt, increase the assessable amount under subsection (2) even if the assessable amount is nil.

##### 115222  Assessing trustees under section 99 or 99A of the Income Tax Assessment Act 1936

    * (1) Subsection (2) applies if:

      * (a) you are the trustee of the trust estate; and

      * (b) section 99A of the _Income Tax Assessment Act 1936_ does not apply in relation to the trust estate in relation to the relevant income year.

    * (2) For each *capital gain of the trust estate, increase the amount (the **_assessable amount_**) in respect of which you are liable to be assessed (and pay tax) under section 99 of the _Income Tax Assessment Act 1936_ in relation to the trust estate by the amount mentioned in subsection 115225(1).

    * (3) Subsection (4) applies if:

      * (a) you are the trustee of the trust estate; and

      * (b) subsection (2) does not apply.

    * (4) For each *capital gain of the trust estate, increase the amount (the **_assessable amount_**) in respect of which you are liable to be assessed (and pay tax) under section 99A of the _Income Tax Assessment Act 1936_ in relation to the trust estate by:

      * (a) if the capital gain was not reduced under either step 3 of the method statement in subsection 1025(1) (discount capital gains) or Subdivision 152C (small business 50% reduction)--the amount mentioned in subsection 115225(1); and

      * (b) if the capital gain was reduced under either step 3 of the method statement or Subdivision 152C but not both (even if it was further reduced by the other small business concessions)--twice the amount mentioned in subsection 115225(1); and

      * (c) if the capital gain was reduced under both step 3 of the method statement and Subdivision 152C (even if it was further reduced by the other small business concessions)--4 times the amount mentioned in subsection 115225(1).

    * (5) To avoid doubt, increase the assessable amount under subsection (2) or (4) even if the assessable amount is nil.

##### 115225  Attributable gain

    * (1) The amount is the product of:

      * (a) the amount of the *capital gain remaining after applying steps 1 to 4 of the method statement in subsection 1025(1); and

      * (b) your *share of the capital gain (see section 115227), divided by the amount of the capital gain.

    * (2) Subsection (3) applies if the net income of the trust estate (disregarding the amount of any *franking credits) for the relevant income year falls short of the sum of:

      * (a) the *net capital gain (if any) of the trust estate for the income year; and

      * (b) the total of all *franked distributions (if any) included in the assessable income of the trust estate for the income year (to the extent that an amount of the franked distributions remained after reducing them by deductions that were directly relevant to them).

    * (3) For the purposes of subsection (1), replace paragraph (a) of that subsection with the following paragraph:

      * (a) the product of:

        * (i) the amount of the *capital gain remaining after applying steps 1 to 4 of the method statement in subsection 1025(1); and

        * (ii) the *net income of the trust estate for that income year (disregarding the amount of any *franking credits), divided by the sum mentioned in subsection (2); and

##### 115227  Share of a capital gain

    * An entity that is a beneficiary or the trustee of a trust estate has a **_share _**of a *capital gain that is the sum of:

      * (a) the amount of the capital gain to which the entity is *specifically entitled; and

      * (b) if there is an amount of the capital gain to which no beneficiary of the trust estate is specifically entitled, and to which the trustee is not specifically entitled--that amount multiplied by the entity's *adjusted Division 6 percentage of the income of the trust estate for the relevant income year.

##### 115228  Specifically entitled to an amount of a capital gain

    * (1) A beneficiary of a trust estate is **_specifically entitled_** to an amount of a *capital gain made by the trust estate in an income year equal to the amount calculated under the following formula:

    * where: 

    * **_net financial benefit_** means an amount equal to the *financial benefit that is referable to the *capital gain (after any application by the trustee of losses, to the extent that the application is consistent with the application of capital losses against the capital gain in accordance with the method statement in subsection 1025(1)).

    * **_share of net financial benefit_** means an amount equal to the *financial benefit that, in accordance with the terms of the trust:

      * (a) the beneficiary has received, or can be reasonably expected to receive; and

      * (b) is referable to the *capital gain (after application by the trustee of any losses, to the extent that the application is consistent with the application of capital losses against the capital gain in accordance with the method statement in subsection 1025(1)); and

      * (c) is recorded, in its character as referable to the capital gain, in the accounts or records of the trust no later than 2 months after the end of the income year.

          * Note: A trustee of a trust estate that makes a choice under section 115230 is taken to be specifically entitled to a capital gain.

    * (2) To avoid doubt, for the purposes of subsection (1), something is done in accordance with the terms of the trust if it is done in accordance with:

      * (a) the exercise of a power conferred by the terms of the trust; or

      * (b) the terms of the trust deed (if any), and the terms applicable to the trust because of the operation of legislation, the common law or the rules of equity.

    * (3) For the purposes of this section, in calculating the amount of the *capital gain, disregard sections 11220 and 11630 (Market value substitution rule) to the extent that those sections have the effect of increasing the amount of the capital gain.

##### 115230  Choice for resident trustee to be specifically entitled to capital gain

    * Purpose

    * (1) The purpose of this section is to allow a trustee of a resident trust to make a choice that has the effect that the trustee will be assessed on a *capital gain of the trust if no trust property representing the capital gain has been paid to or applied for the benefit of a beneficiary of the trust.

    * Trusts for which choice can be made

    * (2) A trustee can only make a choice under this section in relation to a trust estate that is, in the income year in respect of which the choice is made, a resident trust estate (within the meaning of Division 6 of Part III of the _Income Tax Assessment Act 1936_).

    * Circumstances in which choice can be made

    * (3) If:

      * (a) a *capital gain is taken into account in working out the *net capital gain of a trust for an income year; and

      * (b) trust property representing all or part of that capital gain has not been paid to or applied for the benefit of a beneficiary of the trust by the end of 2 months after the end of the income year;

    * the trustee may, no later than the deadline in subsection (5), make a choice that subsection (4) applies in respect of the capital gain.

    * Consequences if trustee makes choice

    * (4) These are the consequences if the trustee makes a choice that this subsection applies in respect of a *capital gain:

      * (a) sections 115215 and 115220 do not apply in relation to the capital gain;

      * (b) for the purposes of this Act, the trustee is taken to be *specifically entitled to all of the capital gain.

    * Deadline for making choice

    * (5) The deadline for the purposes of subsection (3) is:

      * (a) the day 2 months after the last day of the income year; or

    * (2) The amount you can deduct is:

      * (a) 50% of your share of the amount (the **_attributable part_**) worked out under subsection (3) if you are an individual, a trust (except a trust that is a *complying superannuation entity or an *FHSA trust) or a partnership; or

      * (b) 331/3% of your share of the attributable part if you are a complying superannuation entity, an FHSA trust or a *life insurance company.

          * Note 1: The listed investment company will advise you of your share of the attributable part.

          * Note 2: If a shareholder in a listed investment company is a trust or partnership, a beneficiary of the trust or a partner in the partnership has no share of the attributable part.

    * (3) The attributable part is worked out using this formula:

    * where: 

    * **_after tax gain_** is the after tax *LIC capital gain.

          * Example: A listed investment company (which is not a small business entity) disposes of a CGT asset for $30,000. The asset had a cost base of $10,000. The capital gain is therefore $20,000. The company applies a capital loss of $10,000 against the gain. Its net capital gain is $10,000.

          * The net capital gain is subject to tax at 30%. The after tax gain is therefore $7,000.

          * The company pays a fully franked dividend to Daryl, one of its shareholders. It advises Daryl that his share of the attributable part of the dividend is:

          * Daryl, being an individual, can deduct 50% of $10, which is $5.

    * (4) An amount is included in your assessable income if:

      * (a) a deduction is allowed under subsection (1) to a trust or a partnership; and

      * (b) you are a beneficiary of the trust or a partner in the partnership and you are not an individual; and

      * (c) the income of the trust or partnership is reduced by an amount because of that deduction; and

      * (d) a part of the deduction (the **_reduction amount_**) is reflected in your share of the net income of the trust or partnership.

    * (5) The amount included is:

      * (a) the reduction amount if you are a company, a trust (except a trust that is a *complying superannuation entity or an *FHSA trust) or a partnership; or

      * (b) onethird of the reduction amount if you are a complying superannuation entity, an FHSA trust or a *life insurance company.

          * Example: The Burnett Partnership received a dividend from a listed investment company. The dividend statement advised that the dividend included a $100 attributable part. The partnership deducted $50 under this section in calculating its net income.

          * The partnership has 2 equal partners, Amy Burnett and Burnett Consulting Pty Ltd.

          * Burnett Consulting's assessable income includes its share of the net income of the partnership plus $25 (being that part of the $50 deduction allowed to the partnership that is reflected in the company's share of the partnership net income).

          * Subsections (4) and (5) do not apply to Amy because she is an individual.

##### 115285  Meaning of LIC capital gain

    * (1) A **_LIC capital gain_** is a *capital gain:

      * (a) from a *CGT event that happens on or after 1 July 2001; and

      * (b) that is made by a company that is a *listed investment company from a *CGT asset that is an investment to which paragraph 115290(1)(c) applies; and

      * (c) that meets the requirements of sections 11520 and 11525; and

      * (d) that is not a capital gain that could not be a *discount capital gain had it been made by an individual because of section 11540 or 11545; and

      * (e) that is included in the *net capital gain of the company; and

      * (f) that is reflected in the taxable income of the company for the income year in which the company had the net capital gain.

          * Note 1: The listed investment company must be able to demonstrate that at least some part of the LIC capital gain, whether made by the company itself or by another listed investment company, remains after claiming deductions and losses against that income for the income year.

          * Note 2: Section 11530 may affect the date of acquisition of a CGT asset for the purposes of sections 11525, 11540 and 11545.

    * (2) However, a *capital gain made by a company is not a **_LIC capital gain_** if the company:

      * (a) became a *listed investment company after 1 July 2001; and

      * (b) *acquired the *CGT asset concerned before the day on which it became a listed investment company.

    * (3) In applying subsection (2), a *CGT asset is treated as if it had been *acquired by the company _before_ it became a *listed investment company if the asset would otherwise be treated as being acquired _after_ that time because of one of these provisions:

      * (a) section 70110 (about trading stock);

      * (b) Subdivision 124E or 124F (replacement asset rollovers for exchange of *shares, units, rights or options);

      * (ba) Subdivision 124Q (exchange of stapled ownership interests);

      * (c) Subdivision 126B (sameasset rollover for transfers within certain whollyowned groups).

##### 115290  Meaning of listed investment company

    * (1) A **_listed investment company_** is a company:

      * (a) that is an Australian resident; and

      * (b) *shares in which are listed for quotation on the official list of ASX Limited or of a body corporate that is approved as a stock exchange under section 769 of the _Corporations Act 2001_; and

      * (c) at least 90% of the *market value of whose *CGT assets consists of investments permitted by subsection (4).

    * (2) A company is also a **_listed investment company_** if:

      * (a) it is a 100% subsidiary of a company that is a *listed investment company because of subsection (1); and

      * (b) the subsidiary would be a listed investment company because of subsection (1) if it were able to comply with paragraph (1)(b).

    * (3) This Subdivision applies to a company that does not comply with paragraph (1)(c) as if it did comply if the failure:

      * (a) was of a temporary nature only; and

      * (b) was caused by circumstances outside its control.

    * (4) The permitted investments are:

      * (a) *shares, units, options, rights or similar interests to the extent permitted by subsections (5), (6), (7) and (8); or

      * (b) financial instruments (such as loans, debts, debentures, bonds, promissory notes, futures contracts, forward contracts, currency swap contracts and a right or option in respect of a share, security, loan or contract); or

      * (c) an asset whose main use by the company in the course of carrying on its *business is to *derive interest, an annuity, rent, royalties or foreign exchange gains unless:

        * (i) the asset is an intangible asset and has been substantially developed, altered or improved by the company so that its *market value has been substantially enhanced; or

        * (ii) its main use for deriving rent was only temporary; or

      * (d) goodwill.

    * (5) The company can own a *100% subsidiary if the subsidiary is a listed investment company because of subsection (2).

    * (6) The company can own (directly or indirectly) any percentage of another *listed investment company that is not the company's *100% subsidiary.

    * (7) Otherwise, the company cannot own (directly or indirectly) more than 10% of another company or trust.

    * (8) In working out whether a company indirectly owns any part of another company or trust:

      * (a) disregard any ownership it has indirectly through a *listed public company or a *publicly traded unit trust; and

      * (b) if the company owns not more than 50% of another *listed investment company--disregard any ownership it has indirectly through the other company.

##### 115295  Maintaining records

    * A *listed investment company must maintain records showing the balance of its *LIC capital gains available for distribution.

##### 1165  General rules

    * Section 11620 sets out the general rules about capital proceeds. They are relevant to each CGT event that is listed in the table in section 11625.

##### 11610  Modifications to general rules

    * (1) There are 6 modifications to the general rules that may be relevant. The table in section 11625 lists which ones _may_ be relevant to each CGT event listed in the table.

    * Explanation of modifications

    * (2) The first is a market value substitution rule. It is relevant if:

      *  	you receive no capital proceeds from a CGT event; or

      *  	some or all of the capital proceeds cannot be valued; or

      *  	you did not deal at arm's length with another entity in connection with the event.

    * (3) The second is an apportionment rule. It is relevant if a payment you receive in connection with a transaction relates in part only to a CGT event.

          * Example: You sell 3 CGT assets for a total of $100,000. The $100,000 needs to be apportioned between the 3 assets.

    * (4) The third is a nonreceipt rule. It is relevant if you do not receive, or are not likely to receive, some or all of the capital proceeds from a CGT event.

    * (5) The fourth is a repaid rule. It is relevant if you are required to repay some or all of the capital proceeds from a CGT event.

    * (6) The fifth is relevant only if another entity assumes a liability in connection with a CGT event.

    * (7) The sixth relates to misappropriation by an employee or agent. It is relevant if your employee or agent misappropriates all or part of the capital proceeds from a CGT event.

          * Note 1: Also, these provisions of the _Income Tax Assessment Act 1936_ modify capital proceeds:

            * (a) section 23B (undistributed FIF attribution income on disposal of an interest in a FIF);

            * (b) sections 159GZZZF and 159GZZZG (cancellation of shares in a holding company);

            * (c) sections 159GZZZQ and 159GZZZS (buybacks of shares);

            * (d) sections 401, 422, 423 and 461 (CFCs).

          * Note 2: Section 230505 of this Act (Division 230 financial arrangement as consideration for provision or acquisition of a thing) also modifies capital proceeds.

##### General rules

##### 11620  General rules about capital proceeds

    * (1) The **_capital proceeds _**from a *CGT event are the total of:

      * (a) the money you have received, or are entitled to receive, in respect of the event happening; and

      * (b) the *market value of any other property you have received, or are entitled to receive, in respect of the event happening (worked out as at the time of the event).

          * Note 1: The timing rules for each event are in Division 104.

          * Note 2: In some situations you are treated as having received money or other property, or being entitled to receive it: see section 10310.

          * Note 3: If you dispose of shares in a buyback, the capital proceeds are worked out under Division 16K of the _Income Tax Assessment Act 1936_.

    * (2) This table sets out what the **_capital proceeds _**from *CGT events F1, F2, H2 and K9 are:

    * (3) In working out the *market value of the property the subject of the grant, renewal or extension of a longterm lease:

      * (a) include the market value of any building, part of a building, structure or improvement that is treated as a separate *CGT asset from the property; and

      * (b) disregard any *depreciating assets for whose decline in value the lessor has deducted or can deduct an amount under this Act.

          * Note: Subdivision 108D sets out when a building, structure or improvement is treated as a separate CGT asset.

    * (4) In working out the amount of any premium paid or payable to the lessor for the grant, renewal or extension of a longterm lease, disregard any part of it that is attributable to a *depreciating asset of that kind.

    *  The payment of any premium can include giving property: see section 1035.

    * (5) In working out the proceeds of a *CGT event that is a *supply, disregard the amount of your *net GST (if any) on the supply.

##### Modifications to general rules

##### 11625  Table of modifications to the general rules

    * There are 6 modifications to the general rules that _may_ be relevant to a *CGT event. This table tells you:

       *  	each *CGT event for which the general rules about *capital proceeds are relevant; and

       *  	the modifications that can apply to that event; and

       *  	any special rules that apply to that event.

##### 11630  Market value substitution rule: modification 1

    * No capital proceeds

    * (1) If you received no *capital proceeds from a *CGT event, you are taken to have received the *market value of the *CGT asset that is the subject of the event. (The market value is worked out as at the time of the event.)

          * Example: You give a CGT asset to another entity. You are taken to have received the market value of the CGT asset.

    * There are capital proceeds

    * (2) The *capital proceeds from a *CGT event are replaced with the *market value of the *CGT asset that is the subject of the event if:

      * (a) some or all of those proceeds cannot be valued; or

      * (b) those capital proceeds are more or less than the market value of the asset and:

        * (i) you and the entity that *acquired the asset from you did _not_ deal with each other at *arm's length in connection with the event; or

        * (ii) the CGT event is CGT event C2 (about cancellation, surrender and similar endings).

    * (The market value is worked out as at the time of the event.)

    * (2A) Subsection (2) does not apply if there is a partial rollover for the *CGT event because of section 124150.

    * (2B) Subsection (2) does not apply to a situation that would otherwise be covered by paragraph (2)(b) if the *CGT event is *CGT event C2 (about cancellation, surrender and similar endings) and the *CGT asset that is the subject of the event is:

      * (a) a *share in a company that has at least 300 *members and is not a company that is covered by section 11635; or

      * (b) a unit in a unit trust that has at least 300 unit holders and is not a trust that is covered by section 11635.

          * Note: So, for one of these assets, the capital proceeds for the cancellation will be what you actually received.

    * Market value for CGT events C2 and D1

    * (3) Subsection (1) does not apply to:

      * (a) these examples of *CGT event C2:

        * (i) the expiry of a *CGT asset you own;

        * (ii) the cancellation of your *statutory licence; or

      * (b) *CGT event D1 (about creating contractual or other rights).

    * (3A) If you need to work out the *market value of a *CGT asset that is the subject of *CGT event C2, work it out as if the event had not occurred and was never proposed to occur.

          * Example: A company cancels shares you own in it. You work out the market value of the shares by disregarding the cancellation.

    * CGT assets the subject of certain events

    * (4) To avoid doubt, the *CGT asset that is the subject of a *CGT event specified in this table is the asset so specified.

    * Carried interests

    * (5) This section does not apply to *CGT event A1 or C2 to the extent that the CGT event is constituted by ceasing to own:

      * (a) the *carried interest of a *general partner in a *VCLP, an *ESVCLP or an *AFOF or a *limited partner in a *VCMP; or

      * (b) an entitlement to receive a payment of such a carried interest.

          * Note: This section does not apply to ESS interests acquired under employee share schemes: see subsection 13080(4).

##### 11635  Companies and trusts that are not widely held

    * Coverage

    * (1) A company is covered by this section if subsection (3) or (5) applies to the company.

    * (2) A unit trust is covered by this section if subsection (4) or (5) applies to the trust.

    * Concentrated ownership

    * (3) This subsection applies to a company if an individual owns, or up to 20 individuals own between them, directly or indirectly (through one or more interposed entities) and for their own benefit, *shares in the company:

      * (a) carrying *fixed entitlements to at least 75% of the company's income or at least 75% of the company's capital; or

      * (b) carrying at least 75% of the voting power in the company.

    * (4) This subsection applies to a trust if an individual owns, or up to 20 individuals own between them, directly or indirectly (through one or more interposed entities) and for their own benefit, units in the trust:

      * (a) carrying *fixed entitlements to at least 75% of the trust's income or at least 75% of the trust's capital; or

      * (b) if unit holders of the trust have a right to vote in respect of activities of the trust--carrying at least 75% of the voting power in the trust.

    * Possible variation of rights

    * (5) This subsection applies to a company or trust if, because of:

      * (a) any provision in the entity's constituent document, or in any contract, agreement or instrument:

        * (i) authorising the variation or abrogation of rights attaching to any of the *shares or units in the entity; or

        * (ii) relating to the conversion, cancellation, extinguishment or redemption of any of those shares or units; or

      * (b) any contract, *arrangement, option or instrument under which a person has power to acquire any of those shares or units; or

      * (c) any power, authority or discretion in a person in relation to the rights attaching to any of those shares or units;

    * it is reasonable to conclude that the rights attaching to any of those shares or units are capable of being varied or abrogated in such a way (even if they are not in fact varied or abrogated in that way) that, directly or indirectly, subsection (3) or (4) would apply to the entity.

    * Single individual

    * (6) For the purposes of subsections (3) and (4), all of the following are taken to be a single individual:

      * (a) an individual, whether or not the individual holds *shares or units in the entity concerned;

      * (b) the individual's *associates;

      * (c) for any shares or units in respect of which other individuals are nominees of the individual or of the individual's associates--those other individuals.

##### 11640  Apportionment rule: modification 2

    * (1) If you receive a payment in connection with a transaction that relates to more than one *CGT event, the **_capital proceeds _**from each event are so much of the payment as is reasonably attributable to that event.

          * Example: You sell a block of land and a boat for a total of $100,000. This transaction involves 2 CGT events.

          * The $100,000 must be divided among the 2 events. The capital proceeds from the disposal of the land are so much of the $100,000 as is reasonably attributable to it. The rest relates to the boat.

    * (2) If you receive a payment in connection with a transaction that relates to one *CGT event and something else, the **_capital proceeds _**from the event are so much of the payment as is reasonably attributable to the event.

          * Example: You are an architect. You receive $70,000 for selling a block of land and giving advice to the new owner. This transaction involves one CGT event: the disposal of the land.

          * The capital proceeds from the disposal of the land is so much of the $70,000 as is reasonably attributable to that disposal.

    * (3) The payment can include giving property: see section 1035.

##### 11645  Nonreceipt rule: modification 3

    * (1) The *capital proceeds from a *CGT event are reduced if:

      * (a) you are not likely to receive some or all (the **_unpaid amount_**) of those proceeds; and

      * (b) this is not because of anything you (or your *associate) have done or omitted to do; and

      * (c) you took all reasonable steps to get the unpaid amount paid.

    * The capital proceeds are reduced by the unpaid amount.

          * Note: This rule exists because the general rules treat you as having received an amount when you are entitled to receive it.

          * Example	You sell a painting to another entity for $5,000 (the capital proceeds). You agree to accept monthly instalments of $100.

          * You receive $2,000, but then the other entity stops making payments. It becomes clear that you are not likely to receive the remaining $3,000. The capital proceeds are reduced to $2,000.

    * (2) There is a further consequence if:

      * (a) those proceeds are reduced by the unpaid amount; but

      * (b) you later receive a part of that amount.

    * Those proceeds are increased by that part.

    * (3) This Part and Part 33 apply to the debt owed to you (the unpaid amount) as if it were not a *CGT asset.

##### 11650  Repaid rule: modification 4

    * (1) The *capital proceeds from a *CGT event are reduced by:

      * (a) any part of them that you repay; or

      * (b) any compensation you pay that can reasonably be regarded as a repayment of part of them.

    * However, the capital proceeds are not reduced by any part of the payment that you can deduct.

          * Example: You sell a block of land for $50,000 (the capital proceeds). The purchaser later finds out that you misrepresented a term in the contract. The purchaser sues you and the court orders you to pay $10,000 in damages to the purchaser.

          * The capital proceeds are reduced by $10,000.

    * (2) The payment can include giving property: see section 1035.

##### 11655  Assumption of liability rule: modification 5

    * The *capital proceeds from a *CGT event are increased if another entity *acquires the *CGT asset (the subject of the event) subject to a liability by way of security over the asset.

    * They are increased by the amount of the liability the other entity assumes.

          * Example: You sell land for $150,000. You receive $50,000 (the capital proceeds) and the buyer becomes responsible for a $100,000 liability under an outstanding mortgage. The capital proceeds are increased by $100,000 to $150,000.

##### 11660  Misappropriation rule: modification 6

    * (1) The *capital proceeds from a *CGT event are reduced if your employee or *agent misappropriates (whether by theft, embezzlement, larceny or otherwise) all or part of those proceeds.

          * Note: This rule exists because the general rules treat you as having received an amount when you are entitled to receive it.

    * (2) The *capital proceeds are reduced by the amount misappropriated.

    * (3) There is a further consequence if:

      * (a) those proceeds are reduced by the amount misappropriated; and

      * (b) you later receive an amount as *recoupment of all or part of the amount misappropriated.

    * Those proceeds are increased by the amount received.

    * (4) This Part and Part 33 apply to the debt owed to you (the amount misappropriated) as if it were not a *CGT asset.

    * (5) Section 170 of the _Income Tax Assessment Act 1936_ does not prevent the amendment of an assessment for the purposes of giving effect to this section for an income year if:

      * (a) you discover the misappropriation, or you receive an amount as *recoupment of all or part of the amount misappropriated, after you lodged your *income tax return for the income year; and

      * (b) the amendment is made at any time during the period of 4 years starting immediately after you discover the misappropriation or receive the amount.

##### Special rules

##### 11665  Disposal etc. of a CGT asset the subject of an option

    * (1) This section applies if:

      * (a) you granted, renewed or extended an option to create (including grant or issue) or *dispose of a *CGT asset; and

      * (b) another entity exercises the option; and

      * (c) because of the exercise of the option, you create (including grant or issue) or dispose of the CGT asset.

    * (2) The *capital proceeds from the creation (including grant or issue) or disposal include any payment you received for granting, renewing or extending the option.

    * (3) The payment can include giving property: see section 1035.

##### 11670  Option requiring both acquisition and disposal etc.

    * (1) This section applies if:

      * (a) you granted, renewed or extended an option; and

      * (b) the option requires you both to *acquire, and to create (including grant or issue) or *dispose of, a *CGT asset.

    * (2) The option is treated as 2 separate options and half of the *capital proceeds from the grant, renewal or extension is attributed to each option.

##### 11675  Special rule for CGT event happening to a lease

    * The *capital proceeds from the expiry, surrender or forfeiture of a lease include any payment (because of the lease ending) by the lessor to the lessee for expenditure of a capital nature incurred by the lessee in making improvements to the leased property.

    *  The payment or expenditure can include giving property: see section 1035.

##### 11680  Special rule if CGT asset is shares or an interest in a trust

    * (1) This section sets out what happens if:

      * (a) there is a fall in the *market value of a *personal use asset (other than a car, motor cycle or similar vehicle) or a *collectable of a company or trust; and

      * (b) *CGT event A1, C2 or E8 happens to:

        * (i) *shares you own in the company (or in a company that is a member of the same *whollyowned group); or

        * (ii) an interest you have in the trust.

          * Note: The full list of CGT events is in section 1045.

    * (2) The *capital proceeds from the event are replaced with the *market value of the *shares, or the interest in the trust.

    * The market value is worked out as at the time of the event as if the fall in market value of the *personal use asset or *collectable had _not _occurred.

          * Note: You may also make a collectable loss: see CGT event K5.

##### 11685  Section 47A of 1936 Act applying to rolledover asset

    * (2) The reduction is the lesser of:

      * (a) the amount of the dividend; and

      * (b) the amount of any *capital gain that, apart from the rollover, the company or *CFC would have made from the *CGT event if its *capital proceeds from the event had been the asset's *market value (at the time of the event).

          * Note: This section is disregarded in calculating the attributable income of a CFC: see section 410 of the _Income Tax Assessment Act 1936_.

##### 11695  Company changes residence from an unlisted country

    * (1) This section sets out what happens if:

      * (a) a *CFC ceases at a time (the **_residency change time_**) to be a resident of an *unlisted country and becomes a resident of a *listed country; and

      * (aa) subsection 457(3) of the _Income Tax Assessment Act 1936_ does not apply to the change of residence; and

      * (b) because of the change in its residency status, an amount is included in an entity's assessable income under section 457 of the _Income Tax Assessment Act 1936_ (including because of paragraph 58(1)(d) of the _Taxation Laws Amendment (Foreign Income) Act 1990_); and

      * (c) a *CGT event happens in relation to a *CGT asset (the **_CFC asset_**) that is *taxable Australian property and that the CFC owned since the residency change time.

    * (2) If the conditions in subsection (3) are satisfied, the *capital proceeds from the *CGT event are reduced by the amount worked out under subsection (4). If the conditions in subsection (5) are satisfied, those capital proceeds are increased by the amount worked out under subsection (6).

    * Reduction of capital proceeds

    * (3) If all the *CFC's assets were *disposed of at the residency change time for their *market values in the circumstances mentioned in subparagraph 457(2)(a)(ii) of the _Income Tax Assessment Act 1936_:

      * (a) *distributable profits of the CFC of a particular amount (the **_distributable profit amount_**) would be created, or its distributable profits would be increased by an amount (also the **_distributable profit amount_**); and

      * (b) the CFC would have made a profit (the **_CFC asset profit_**) on the disposal of the CFC asset.

    * (4) The *capital proceeds are reduced by:

    * where: 

    * **_total asset profits_** is the sum of the profits that the CFC would have made if all its assets were *disposed of at the residency change time for their *market values (ignoring disposals that would not result in a profit).

    * Increase in capital proceeds

    * (5) If all the *CFC's assets were *disposed of at the residency change time for their *market values in the circumstances mentioned in subparagraph 457(2)(a)(ii) of the _Income Tax Assessment Act 1936_:

      * (a) the *distributable profits of the CFC would be reduced by an amount (the **_distributable profit reduction amount_**); and

      * (b) the CFC would have made a loss (the **_CFC asset loss_**) on the disposal of the CFC asset.

    * (6) The *capital proceeds are increased by:

    * where: 

    * **_total asset losses_** is the sum of the losses that the CFC would have made if all its assets were *disposed of at the residency change time for their *market values (ignoring disposals that would not result in a loss).

          * Note: This section is disregarded in calculating the attributable income of a CFC: see section 410 of the _Income Tax Assessment Act 1936_.

##### 116100  Gifts of property

    * (1) If CGT event A1 is the giving of a gift of property by you for which a valuation under section 30212 is obtained, you may choose that the *capital proceeds from the event are replaced with the value of the property as determined under the valuation.

    * (2) You can only make this choice if the valuation was made no more than 90 days before or after the CGT event.

##### 116105  Conservation covenants

    * If *CGT event D4 happens because you enter into a *conservation covenant over land you own and you can deduct an amount under Division 31 because you enter into the covenant, the *capital proceeds from the event are the amount you can deduct.

##### 116110  Rollovers for merging superannuation funds

##### Exempt assets

##### 1185  Cars, motor cycles and valour decorations

    * A *capital gain or *capital loss you make from any of these *CGT assets is disregarded:

      * (a) a *car, motor cycle or similar vehicle;

      * (b) a decoration awarded for valour or brave conduct (unless you paid money or gave any other property for it).

##### 11810  Collectables and personal use assets

    * (1) A *capital gain or *capital loss you make from a *collectable is disregarded if the first element of its *cost base, or the first element of its *cost if it is a *depreciating asset, is $500 or less.

          * Example: On 10 July 2001, Gayle buys a print for $450 and hangs it in her home. On 30 November 2001 she takes the print to her office and hangs it in the lobby. Gayle self assesses the effective life of the print to be 7 years.

          * Gayle sells the print to Anna for $700 on 2 January 2002.

          * How much can Gayle deduct for the 200102 income year?

          * The cost of the print is $450. Gayle chooses to use the prime cost method to calculate its decline in value.

          * The print's decline in value is:

          * = $31

          * Gayle can deduct $6 as the taxable use portion of the decline in value under Division 40:

          * Due to the balancing adjustment event that occurred on 2 January 2002, $54 is included in Gayle's assessable income for the 200102 income year under section 40285. The amount is reduced for nontaxable use by section 40290.

          * A capital gain of $202 is disregarded under this section because the asset is a collectable acquired for less than $500.

    * (2) However, there is a special rule if the *collectable is an interest in one of these *CGT assets:

      * (a) *artwork, jewellery, an antique, or a coin or medallion;

      * (b) a rare folio, manuscript or book;

      * (c) a postage stamp or first day cover.

    * A *capital gain or *capital loss you make from the interest is disregarded only if the *market value of the asset (when you *acquired the interest) is $500 or less.

          * Note: If you last acquired the interest before 16 December 1995, a capital gain or loss is disregarded if you acquired the _interest_ for $500 or less: see section 11810 of the _Income Tax (Transitional Provisions) Act 1997_.

    * (3) A *capital gain you make from a *personal use asset, or part of the asset, is disregarded if the first element of the asset's *cost base, or the first element of its *cost if it is a *depreciating asset, is $10,000 or less.

          * Note: A capital loss you make from a personal use asset is disregarded: see subsection 10820(1).

##### 11812  Assets used to produce exempt income etc.

    * (1) A *capital gain or *capital loss you make from a *CGT asset that you used solely to produce your *exempt income or *nonassessable nonexempt income is disregarded.

    * (2) However, the exemption does not apply if the asset was used to gain or produce an amount that is *nonassessable nonexempt income because of:

      * (a) any of these provisions of this Act:

        * (i) section 5915 (mining payments);

        * (ia) section 5935 (amounts that would be mutual receipts but for prohibition on distributions to members);

        * (ii) subsection 7090(2) (disposing of trading stock outside the ordinary course of business);

        * (iii) section 8630 (income of a personal services entity);

        * (iv) subsection 8635(1) (payment by a personal services entity);

        * (v) subsection 8635(2) (share of personal services entity's net income);

        * (vi) section 24040 (treatment of arrangement payments);

        * (via) section 24240 (about luxury car lease payments);

        * (vib) section 7685 (foreign equity distributions on participation interests);

        * (vii) section 80215 (foreign residents--exempting CFI from Australian tax);

        * (viii) section 840815 (foreign residents--final withholding tax on managed investment trust income); or

      * (b) any of these provisions of the _Income Tax Assessment Act 1936_:

        * (i) section 23AH (foreign branch profits of Australian companies);

        * (ii) section 23AI (amounts paid out of attributed income);

        * (iv) section 23AK (attributed foreign investment fund income);

        * (v) subsection 23L(1) (fringe benefits);

        * (vi) subsection 99B(2A) (attributed trust income);

        * (vii) section 128D (dividends, royalties and interest subject to withholding tax);

        * (viii) subsection 271105(3) in Schedule 2F (amounts subject to family trust distribution tax).

          * Note: These provisions make amounts nonassessable nonexempt income to prevent them being double taxed rather than to remove them entirely from the taxation system. Therefore, the policy reason for disregarding gains and losses does not apply to assets used to produce those amounts.

##### 11813  Shares in a PDF

    * A *capital gain or *capital loss you make from a *CGT event happening in relation to *shares in a *PDF is disregarded.

##### 11815  Registered emissions units

    * (1) A *capital gain or *capital loss you make from a *registered emissions unit is disregarded.

    * (3) A *capital gain or *capital loss you make from a right to receive an *Australian carbon credit unit is disregarded.

##### Antioverlap provisions

##### 11820  Reducing capital gains if amount otherwise assessable

    * (1) A *capital gain you make from a *CGT event is reduced if, because of the event, a provision of this Act (outside of this Part) includes an amount (for any income year) in:

      * (a) your assessable income or *exempt income; or

      * (b) if you are a partner in a partnership, the assessable income or exempt income of the partnership.

    * (1A) Subsection (1) applies to an amount that, under a provision of this Act (outside of this Part), is included in:

      * (a) your assessable income or *exempt income; or

      * (b) if you are a partner in a partnership, the assessable income or exempt income of the partnership;

    * in relation to a *CGT asset as if it were so included because of the *CGT event referred to in that subsection if the amount would also be taken into account in working out the amount of a *capital gain you make.

          * Note: An example is an amount assessable under Division 16E of Part III of the _Income Tax Assessment Act 1936_, which deals with accruals taxation of certain securities.

    * (1B) The rule in subsection (1) does not apply to:

      * (a) an amount that is taken to be a dividend under section 159GZZZP of the _Income Tax Assessment Act 1936_ (which relates to buybacks of *shares); or

      * (b) an amount included in assessable income under subsection 20720(1), 20735(1) or 20735(3) of this Act (which relate to franked distributions).

    * (2) The gain is reduced to zero if it does _not_ exceed:

      * (a) the amount included; or

      * (b) if you are a partner, your share (the **_partner's share_**) of the amount included in the assessable income or *exempt income of the partnership (calculated according to your entitlement to share in the partnership net income or loss).

          * Example: Liz bought some land in 1990, as part of a profitmaking scheme. In December 1998 she sells it.

          * Her profit from the sale is $40,000 and is included in her assessable income under section 65 (about ordinary income).

          * Suppose she made a capital gain from the sale of $30,000. It is reduced to zero because it is does not exceed the amount included.

    * (3) The gain is reduced by the amount included, or the amount of the partner's share, if the gain exceeds that amount.

          * Note: These rules are modified for complying superannuation funds that become noncomplying and for foreign superannuation funds that become Australian superannuation funds: see Division 295.

    * (4) A *capital gain you make from a *CGT event is reduced by the extent that a provision of this Act (except sections 5940 and 316255) treats:

      * (a) an amount of your *ordinary income or *statutory income from the event as being *nonassessable nonexempt income; or

      * (b) if you are a partner, your share of the ordinary income or *statutory income of the partnership from the event (calculated according to your entitlement to share in the partnership net income or loss) as being nonassessable nonexempt income of the partnership.

          * Note: An example of a provision of this kind is section 121EG (about offshore banking units) of the _Income Tax Assessment Act 1936_.

    * (4A) A *capital gain the trustee of a *superannuation fund makes from a *CGT event happening in relation to a *CGT asset in an income year is reduced if the asset's *market value was taken into account in working out the fund's income from previous years under section 295325 or 295330.

    * (4B) The gain is reduced to zero if it does not exceed the amount that would have been the *capital gain from the *CGT event if the *capital proceeds from the event were the asset's *market value that was taken into account in working out that net previous income.

    * If the gain exceeds that amount, it is reduced by that amount.

    * Exceptions

    * (5) The gain is not reduced if an amount is included in your assessable income, or the assessable income of the partnership, for any income year because of a balancing adjustment.

    * (6) The gain is not reduced if an amount is included in your *nonassessable nonexempt income under section 7685 (about foreign equity distributions on participation interests) because a company makes a *foreign equity distribution that is:

      * (a) debited against a *share capital account of the company; or

      * (c) debited against an asset revaluation reserve of the company; or

      * (d) directly or indirectly attributable to amounts transferred from such an account or reserve of the company.

##### 11821  Carried interests

    * CGT events relating to carried interests not to be treated as income

    * (1) The modifications in subsections (2) and (3) apply if *CGT event K9 happens in relation to your entitlement to receive a payment of the *carried interest of a *general partner in a *VCLP, an *ESVCLP or an *AFOF or a *limited partner in a *VCMP.

    * (2) These provisions do not apply to the CGT event:

      * (a) sections 65 (about *ordinary income), 81 (about amounts you can deduct), 1515 and 2540 (about profitmaking undertakings or plans) and 11820 (reducing capital gains if amount otherwise assessable);

      * (b) sections 25A and 52 of the _Income Tax Assessment Act 1936_ (about profitmaking undertakings or schemes).

    * (3) Section 610 (about *statutory income) does not apply to the *CGT event except so far as that section applies in relation to section 1025 (about net capital gains).

##### 11822  Superannuation lump sums and employment termination payments

    * In applying section 11820, treat a *superannuation lump sum or an *employment termination payment that you receive as being included in your assessable income.

##### 11824  Depreciating assets

    * (1) A *capital gain or *capital loss you make from a *CGT event (that is also a *balancing adjustment event) that happens to a *depreciating asset is disregarded if the asset was:

      * (a) an asset you *held; or

      * (b) if you are a partner, an asset of the partnership; or

      * (c) if you are absolutely entitled to the asset as against the trustee of a trust (disregarding any legal disability), an asset of the trustee;

    * where the decline in value of the asset was worked out under Division 40 (including that Division as it applies under Division 355), or the deduction for the asset was calculated under Division 328, or would have been if the asset had been used.

    * (2) However, subsection (1) does not apply to:

      * (a) a *capital gain or *capital loss you make from *CGT event J2 or *CGT event K7 happening; or

      * (b) a *depreciating asset for which you or another entity has deducted or can deduct amounts under Subdivision 40F or 40G.

##### 11825  Trading stock

    * (1) A *capital gain or *capital loss you make from a *CGT asset is disregarded if, at the time of the *CGT event, the asset is:

      * (a) your *trading stock; or

      * (b) if you are a partner, trading stock of the partnership; or

      * (c) if you are absolutely entitled to the asset as against the trustee of a trust (disregarding any legal disability), trading stock of the trustee.

    * (2) A *capital gain or *capital loss you make in these circumstances is disregarded:

      * (a) you start holding as *trading stock a *CGT asset you already own but do not hold as trading stock; and

      * (b) you elect under paragraph 7030(1)(a) to be treated as having sold the asset for its cost (worked out under that section).

          * Note 1: Paragraph 7030(1)(a) allows you to elect the cost of the asset, or its market value, just before it became trading stock.

          * Note 2: You may make a capital gain or loss if you elect its market value: see CGT event K4.

##### 11827  Division 230 financial arrangements and financial arrangements to which Subdivision 250E applies

          * Note 1: Paragraph (b) is relevant for CGT event D1.

          * Note 2: Paragraph (c) is relevant for CGT event L7.

    * (2) Subsection (1) does not apply to the following:

      * (b) a loss that is reduced under subsection 230465(2), to the extent of that reduction (this is the extent to which the loss is of a capital nature).

    * (3) Subsection (1) does not apply if the situation that gives rise to the *CGT event does _not_ result in a gain from the arrangement being included in your assessable income under Division 230, or in a loss from the arrangement entitling you to a deduction under Division 230.

    * (4) A *capital gain or *capital loss you make from a *CGT asset is disregarded if, at the time of the *CGT event, the asset is, or is part of, a *financial arrangement to which Subdivision 250E applies.

##### 11830  Film copyright

    * (1) A *capital gain or *capital loss you make from a *CGT event relating to your interest in the copyright in a film is disregarded if an amount is included in your assessable income under section 26AG (about film proceeds) of the _Income Tax Assessment Act 1936_ because of the event.

##### Guide to Subdivision 118B

##### 118100  What this Subdivision is about

    * You can ignore a capital gain or capital loss you make from a CGT event that happens to a dwelling that is your main residence.

    * However, this exemption may not apply in full if:

      *  	it was your main residence during part only of your ownership period; or

      *  	it was used for the purpose of producing assessable income.

    * There are special rules for dwellings passed from, or owned by a trustee of, a deceased estate.

    * There is a similar exemption for a CGT event that is a compulsory acquisition (or similar arrangement) happening to adjacent land but not also to the dwelling itself.

##### 118135  Moving into a dwelling

    * If a *dwelling becomes your main residence by the time it was first practicable for you to move into it after you *acquired your *ownership interest in it, the dwelling is treated as your main residence from when you acquired the interest until it actually became your main residence.

      * (a) 6 years; or

      * (b) if, just before the key event, you used all or part of the old dwelling for that purpose--so much of the period of 6 years described in subsection 118145(2) in relation to the old dwelling as had not passed before the event.

    * (5) If you do not use the *dwelling or substitute land as described in subsection (3) you can treat the dwelling as your main residence under this section indefinitely.

    * (6) If you make the choice:

      * (a) you cannot treat any other *dwelling as your main residence while you apply this section; and

      * (b) section 118140 does not apply in relation to your *acquisition, while you still have an *ownership interest in the old dwelling, of an ownership interest in the dwelling you choose to treat as your main residence under this section; and

    * (3) You can make the choice only if:

      * (a) a *dwelling on the land that you construct, repair or renovate becomes your main residence (except because of section 118147) as soon as practicable after the work is finished; and

      * (b) it continues to be your main residence for at least 3 months.

    * (4) There is a time limit during which the choice can operate. This is the shorter of:

      * (a) 4 years, or a longer time allowed by the Commissioner, before the *dwelling becomes your main residence; and

      * (b) the period starting when you *acquired your *ownership interest in the land and ending when the dwelling becomes your main residence.

    * (5) If there was already a *dwelling on the land when you *acquired your *ownership interest and you or someone else occupied it after that time, the period in subsection (2) and paragraph (4)(b) starts when the dwelling ceased to be occupied.

    * (6) Once you make the choice, no other *dwelling can be treated as your main residence during the period referred to in subsection (4), except if section 118140 (about changing main residences) applies.

##### 118155  Where individual referred to in section 118150 dies

    * (1) This section applies if the individual referred to in subsection 118150(1) dies:

      * (a) after the work began, or the individual entered into a contract for it to be done, but before it was finished; or

      * (b) after the work was finished but before it was practicable for the *dwelling to become the individual's main residence; or

      * (c) during the period of 3 months referred to in paragraph 118150(3)(b).

    * (2) If the individual owned the interest in the land as a joint tenant, the surviving joint tenant or, if none, the trustee of the individual's estate, can choose to apply this Subdivision as if the *dwelling were the main residence of the individual:

      * (a) when the individual died; and

      * (b) for the shorter of:

        * (i) 4 years before the individual's death; or

        * (ii) the period starting when the individual *acquired the interest in the land and ending when the individual died.

    * (3) If there was already a *dwelling on the land when the individual *acquired the interest in the land and someone occupied it after that time, the period in subparagraph (2)(b)(ii) starts when the dwelling ceased to be occupied so that it could be repaired or renovated.

    * (4) If the *dwelling is treated as the deceased's main residence under this section, no other dwelling can be treated as the deceased's main residence at the same time.

##### 118160  Destruction of dwelling and sale of land

    * (1) This section applies if a *dwelling that is your main residence is accidentally destroyed and a *CGT event happens in relation to the land on which it was built without you erecting another dwelling on the land.

    * (2) You can choose to apply this Subdivision to the land as if, from the time of the destruction until your *ownership interest in the land ends, the *dwelling had not been destroyed and were your main residence.

    * (3) If you do so, you cannot treat any other *dwelling as your main residence during that period, except under section 118140 (about changing main residences).

##### Rules that may limit the exemption

##### 118165  Separate CGT event for adjacent land or other structures

    * The exemption does not apply to a *CGT event that happens in relation to land, or a garage, storeroom or other structure, to which the exemption can extend under section 118120 (about adjacent land) if that event does not also happen in relation to the *dwelling or your *ownership interest in it.

          * Note: There is a separate rule for a CGT event that is a compulsory acquisition (or similar arrangement) happening to adjacent land but not also to the dwelling itself: see section 118245.

##### 118170  Spouse having different main residence

    * (1) If, during a period, a *dwelling is your main residence and another *dwelling is the main residence of your *spouse (except a spouse living permanently separately and apart from you), you and your spouse must either:

      * (a) choose one of the dwellings as the main residence of both of you for the period; or

      * (b) nominate the different dwellings as your main residences for the period.

    * (2) If you nominate the different *dwellings as your main residences for the period, you split the exemption in accordance with subsections (3) and (4).

    * (3) If your interest in the *dwelling you chose was not, during the period, more than half of the total interests in the dwelling, the dwelling is taken to have been your main residence during the period. Otherwise, the dwelling is taken to have been your main residence for half of the period.

    * (4) If your *spouse's interest in the *dwelling your spouse chose was not, during the period, more than half of the total interests in the dwelling, the dwelling is taken to have been your spouse's main residence during the period. Otherwise, the dwelling is taken to have been your spouse's main residence for half of the period.

          * Example: You and your spouse own a town house as tenants in common in equal shares. You and your spouse also own a beach house as tenants in common, with your interest being 30% and your spouse's 70%. From 1 July 1999, you live mainly in the town house and your spouse lives mainly in the beach house. On 1 July 2000 you and your spouse dispose of both dwellings.

          * For the period 1 July 199930 June 2000 you nominate the town house as your main residence and your spouse nominates the beach house. The town house is taken to be your main residence during the period. The beach house is taken to be your spouse's main residence during half the period.

##### 118175  Dependent child having different main residence

    * If, at a particular time, a *dwelling is your main residence and another *dwelling is the main residence of a *child of yours who is under 18 and is dependent on you for economic support, you must choose one of them as the main residence of both of you.

##### Rollovers under Subdivision 126A

##### 118178  Previous rollover under Subdivision 126A

    * (1) This section applies to you if:

      * (a) you *acquired an *ownership interest in a *dwelling from another person (your **_former partner_**) as a result of a *CGT event (the **_earlier event_**); and

      * (b) your former partner acquired the ownership interest on or after 20 September 1985; and

      * (c) there was a rollover under Subdivision 126A (marriage or relationship breakdown rollover) for the earlier event; and

      * (d) a CGT event (the **_later event_**) happens in relation to the ownership interest.

    * (2) This Subdivision applies to the later event in the way that it would if:

      * (a) your *ownership interest had commenced when your former partner's ownership interest commenced (the **_acquisition time_**); and

      * (b) from the acquisition time until the time your former partner's ownership interest ended:

        * (i) you had used the *dwelling in the same way that your former partner used it; and

        * (ii) the dwelling had been your main residence for the same number of days as it was your former partner's main residence.

          * Example 1: Peter (the transferor spouse) is the 100% owner of a dwelling that he uses only as a main residence before transferring it to Susan (the transferee spouse). Susan uses the dwelling only as a rental property.

          * Susan will be eligible for a partial main residence exemption having regard to how both Peter and Susan used the dwelling.

          * Example 2: Caroline (the transferor spouse) is the 100% owner of a dwelling that she uses only as a rental property before transferring it to David (the transferee spouse). David uses the dwelling only as a main residence.

          * David will be eligible for only a partial main residence exemption having regard to how both Caroline and David used the dwelling.

##### 118180  Acquisition of dwelling from company or trust on marriage or relationship breakdown--rollover provision applying

    * (1) This Subdivision applies to you as if you owned an *ownership interest in land or a dwelling during a period when it was actually owned by a company or trustee if:

      * (a) you *acquired the interest from the company or trustee; and

      * (b) it was acquired by the company or trustee _on or after_ 20 September 1985; and

      * (c) a rollover was available to the company or trustee under Subdivision 126A.

    * (2) If subsection (1) applies to a *dwelling, it cannot be treated as your main residence during the period, despite other provisions of this Subdivision that would allow you to treat it as your main residence during the period.

##### Partial exemption rules

##### 118185  Partial exemption where dwelling was your main residence during part only of ownership period

    * (1) You get only a partial exemption for a *CGT event that happens in relation to a *dwelling or your *ownership interest in it if:

      * (a) you are an individual; and

      * (b) the dwelling was your main residence for part only of your *ownership period; and

      * (c) the interest did not *pass to you as a beneficiary in, and you did not *acquire it as a trustee of, the estate of a deceased person.

    * (2) You calculate your *capital gain or *capital loss using the formula:

    * where: 

    * **_CG or CL amount_** is the *capital gain or *capital loss you would have made from the *CGT event apart from this Subdivision.

    * **_nonmain residence days _**is the number of days in your *ownership period when the *dwelling was not your main residence.

          * Note: The capital gain or loss may be further adjusted if the dwelling was used to produce assessable income: see section 118190.

          * Example: You bought a house in July 1990 and moved in immediately. In July 1993, you moved out and began to rent it. You sold it in July 2000, making (apart from this Subdivision) a capital gain of $10,000.

          * You choose to continue to treat the dwelling as your main residence under section 118145 (about absences) for the first 6 of the 7 years during which you rented the house out.

          * Under this section, you will be taken to have made a capital gain of:

##### 118190  Use of dwelling for producing assessable income

    * (1) You get only a partial exemption for a *CGT event that happens in relation to a *dwelling or your *ownership interest in it if:

      * (a) apart from this section, because the dwelling was your main residence or someone else's during a period:

        * (i) you would not make a *capital gain or *capital loss from the event; or

        * (ii) you would make a lesser capital gain or loss than if this Subdivision had not applied; and

      * (b) the dwelling was used for the *purpose of producing assessable income during all or a part of that period; and

      * (c) if you had incurred interest on money borrowed to *acquire the dwelling, or your ownership interest in it, you could have deducted some or all of that interest.

          * Example: You acquire a house as a beneficiary in a deceased estate, rent it out for 12 months and sell it within 2 years of the deceased's death. You can ignore the rental because the exemption does not require the house to be your main residence during the 2 years after the death.

    * (2) The *capital gain or *capital loss that you would have made apart from this section from the *CGT event is increased by an amount that is reasonable having regard to the extent to which you would have been able to deduct that interest.

    * (3) However, you ignore any use of the *dwelling for the *purpose of producing assessable income during any period that you continue to treat it as your main residence under section 118145 (about absences) to the extent that any part of it was not used for that purpose just before it last ceased to be your main residence.

          * Example: To continue the example from section 118185, assume that, when you moved in, you used 1/4 of the house as a doctor's surgery.

          * Under section 118185, your capital gain was $1,000.

          * Under this section, it would be reasonable to add an amount of: 

          * You have a total capital gain of $3,250 on the sale of the house.

    * (3A) Also, you ignore any use of the *dwelling for the *purpose of producing assessable income during any period that you treat it as your main residence under section 118147 (about absences) to the extent that any part of the old dwelling mentioned in that section was not used for that purpose just before the old dwelling last ceased to be your main residence.

    * (4) If a *dwelling or your *ownership interest in a dwelling *passed to you as a beneficiary in a deceased estate, or you owned it as the trustee of a deceased estate, you ignore any use of the *dwelling for the *purpose of producing assessable income before the deceased's death if:

      * (a) the dwelling was the deceased's main residence just before the death; and

      * (b) it was not being used for that purpose just before the death, or any use for that purpose just before the death was ignored because of subsection (3).

##### 118192  Special rule for first use to produce income

    * (1) There is a special rule if:

      * (a) you would get only a partial exemption under this Subdivision for a *CGT event happening in relation to a *dwelling or your *ownership interest in it because the dwelling was used for the *purpose of producing assessable income during your *ownership period; and

      * (aa) that use occurred for the first time after 7.30 pm, by legal time in the Australian Capital Territory, on 20 August 1996; and

      * (b) you would have got a full exemption under this Subdivision if the CGT event had happened just before the first time (the **_income time_**) it was used for that purpose during your ownership period.

    * (2) You are taken to have *acquired the *dwelling or your *ownership interest at the income time for its *market value at that time.

    * (3) If your *ownership interest in the *dwelling *passed to you as a beneficiary in a deceased estate, or you owned it as the trustee of a deceased estate and the *CGT event did not happen within 2 years of the deceased's death, you apply this Subdivision as if:

      * (a) you had *acquired the interest as an individual and not as a beneficiary or trustee of a deceased estate; and

      * (b) for applying the formula in section 118185, your _nonmain residence days_ were the number of days in your *ownership period when the dwelling was not the main residence of an individual referred to in item 2, column 3 of the table in section 118195.

          * Note: There are special rules for dwellings acquired before 7.30 pm on 20 August 1996: see section 118195 of the _Income Tax (Transitional Provisions) Act 1997_.

##### Dwellings acquired from deceased estates

##### 118195  Dwelling acquired from a deceased estate

    * (1) A *capital gain or *capital loss you make from a *CGT event that happens in relation to a *dwelling or your *ownership interest in it is disregarded if:

      * (a) you are an individual and the interest *passed to you as a beneficiary in a deceased estate, or you owned it as the trustee of a deceased estate; and

      * (b) at least one of the items in column 2 and at least one of the items in column 3 of the table are satisfied.

          * Note 1: You may make a capital gain or capital loss if the dwelling was used for the purpose of producing assessable income: see section 118190.

          * Note 2: In some cases the use of a dwelling to produce assessable income can be disregarded: see sections 118145 and 118190.

          * Note 3: There are special rules for dwellings acquired before 7.30 pm on 20 August 1996. These rules also affect the operation of section 118192 and subsections 118190(4) and 118200(4): see section 118195 of the _Income Tax (Transitional Provisions) Act 1997_.

    * (2) Only these *CGT events are relevant:

      * (a) CGT events A1, B1, C1, C2, E1, E2, F2, I1, I2, K3, K4 and K6 (except one involving the forfeiting of a deposit); and

      * (b) a CGT event that involves the forfeiting of a deposit as part of an uninterrupted sequence of transactions ending in one of the events specified in paragraph (a) subsequently happening.

          * Note: The full list of CGT events is in section 1045.

##### 118197  Special rule for surviving joint tenant

    * This Subdivision applies to you as if the *ownership interest of another individual in a *dwelling had *passed to you as a beneficiary in a deceased estate if:

      * (a) you and the other individual owned ownership interests in the dwelling as joint tenants; and

      * (b) the other individual dies.

##### 118200  Partial exemption for deceased estate dwellings

    * (1) You get only a partial exemption (or no exemption) if:

      * (a) you are an individual and your *ownership interest in a *dwelling *passed to you as a beneficiary in a deceased estate, or you owned it as the trustee of a deceased estate; and

      * (b) section 118195 does not apply.

    * (2) You calculate your *capital gain or *capital loss using the formula:

    * where: 

    * **_CG or CL amount_** is the *capital gain or *capital loss you would have made from the *CGT event apart from this Subdivision.

    * **_nonmain residence days _**is the sum of:

      * (a) if the deceased *acquired the *ownership interest _on or after_ 20 September 1985--the number of days in the deceased's *ownership period when the *dwelling was not the deceased's main residence; and

      * (b) the number of days in the period from the death until your ownership interest ends when the dwelling was not the main residence of an individual referred to in item 2, column 3 of the table in section 118195.

    * **_total days_** is:

      * (a) if the deceased *acquired the *ownership interest _before_ 20 September 1985--the number of days in the period from the death until your ownership interest ends; or

      * (b) if the deceased acquired the ownership interest _on or after_ that day--the number of days in the period from the acquisition of the dwelling by the deceased until your ownership interest ends.

    * (3) However, you can adjust the formula by ignoring any _nonmain residence days_ and _total days_ in the period from the deceased's death until your *ownership interest ended, if:

      * (a) the deceased *acquired the ownership interest _on or after_ 20 September 1985; and

      * (b) your ownership interest ends within:

        * (i) 2 years of the deceased's death; or

        * (ii) a longer period allowed by the Commissioner; and

      * (c) you get a more favourable result by doing so.

          * Note 1: The formula in this section will be adjusted (or further adjusted) under section 118205 if the deceased acquired the dwelling through a deceased estate.

          * Note 2: There may be a further adjustment if the dwelling was used for the purpose of producing assessable income: see section 118190.

    * (4) You ignore any _nonmain residence days_ before the deceased's death if:

      * (a) the *dwelling was the deceased's main residence just before the death; and

      * (b) the dwelling was not being used for the *purpose of producing assessable income just before the death, or any use for that purpose just before the death was ignored because of subsection 118190(3) or (3A).

##### 118205  Adjustment if dwelling inherited from deceased individual

    * (1) You must adjust the formula in subsection 118200(2) if the *ownership interest of the deceased individual referred to in section 118200 (the **_most recently deceased_**) *passed to the individual _on or after_ 20 September 1985 as a beneficiary in, or the individual owned it as trustee of, a deceased estate.

          * Note: Any gains or losses of individuals earlier in the inheritance chain are included in the gain or loss you would have made apart from this Subdivision. This section adjusts the formula to take account of times when the dwelling was the main residence of the individuals.

    * (2) Add to the component **_total days _**in the formula the fewer of:

      * (a) the number of days between 20 September 1985 and the day when the interest *passed to or was *acquired as trustee by the most recently deceased; and

      * (b) the number of days between the time when an *ownership interest in the *dwelling was last acquired _on or after_ 20 September 1985 by an individual except as a beneficiary in a deceased estate or as trustee of a deceased estate and the day when the interest passed to or was acquired as trustee by the most recently deceased.

    * (3) Add to the component **_nonmain residence days_** in the formula the number of days in the period applicable under subsection (2) that the *dwelling was not the main residence of one or more of:

      * (a) an individual who owned the dwelling at the time of the individual's death; or

      * (b) an individual who, immediately before the death of an individual referred to in paragraph (a), was the spouse of that individual (except a spouse who was living permanently separately and apart from the individual); or

      * (c) an individual who had a right to occupy the dwelling under a will; or

      * (d) an individual to whom an *ownership interest in the dwelling *passed as a beneficiary in, or who *acquired an ownership interest in the dwelling as trustee of, a deceased estate.

##### 118210  Trustee acquiring dwelling under will

    * (1) This section applies if you are the trustee of a deceased estate and, under the deceased's will, you *acquire an *ownership interest in a *dwelling for occupation by an individual.

    * (2) If a *CGT event happens to the interest in relation to the individual and you receive no money or property for it:

      * (a) a *capital gain or *capital loss you make from the event is disregarded; and

      * (b) the first element of the *dwelling's *cost base and *reduced cost base in the hands of the individual is its cost base and reduced cost base in your hands at the time of the event; and

      * (c) the individual is taken to have *acquired it when you did.

    * (3) If:

      * (a) you receive money or property for the *CGT event happening or the event happens in relation to another entity; and

      * (b) the dwelling was the main residence of the individual from the time you *acquired the interest until the time of the event;

    * you do not make a *capital gain or *capital loss from the CGT event.

    * (4) However, if the *dwelling was the main residence of the individual during part only of that period, you make a *capital gain or *capital loss worked out using the formula:

    * where: 

    * **_CG or CL amount_** is the *capital gain or *capital loss you would have made from the *CGT event apart from this Subdivision.

    * **_nonmain residence days _**is the number of days in that period when the *dwelling was not the individual's main residence.

    * (5) Only these *CGT events are relevant:

      * (a) CGT events A1, B1, C1, C2, E1, E2, E5, F2, I1, I2, K3, K4 and K6 (except one involving the forfeiting of a deposit); and

      * (b) a CGT event that involves the forfeiting of a deposit as part of an uninterrupted sequence of transactions ending in one of the events specified in paragraph (a) subsequently happening.

          * Note: The full list of CGT events is in section 1045.

##### Special disability trusts

##### 118215  What the following provisions are about

    * The trustee of a trust that is or has been a special disability trust may be eligible for an exemption to the extent that a dwelling is the main residence of the individual who is or has been the principal beneficiary of the trust.

    * Another beneficiary of the trust may be eligible for an exemption if the dwelling is distributed to that other beneficiary at or after the principal beneficiary's death.

          * Note: The following provisions also apply to the exemption about compulsory acquisitions of adjacent land (see section 118245).

##### 118218  Exemption available to trustee--main case

    * (1) This section applies to you in relation to a *CGT event if:

      * (a) the CGT event happens in relation to a *CGT asset; and

      * (b) just before the CGT event happens, you hold the CGT asset as trustee of a trust; and

      * (c) the trust was a *special disability trust on at least one of the days on which you held the CGT asset.

    * (2) For the purposes of applying this Subdivision in relation to the *CGT event, on each day to which paragraph (1)(c) applies:

      * (a) treat yourself as holding the *CGT asset personally (and not as trustee of the trust); and

      * (b) if the *principal beneficiary of the trust uses the applicable *dwelling in a particular way on that day--treat yourself as using the dwelling in that way on that day.

          * Example: If the principal beneficiary uses the dwelling as his or her main residence on the day, then treat yourself as using the dwelling as your main residence on that day.

          * Note 1: The CGT asset need not be a dwelling (or an ownership interest in a dwelling) if it is land adjacent to a dwelling, an adjacent structure of a flat or home unit, or an ownership interest in such an asset.

          * Note 2: If the trustee is an individual, the individual's actual circumstances are ignored. Similarly, this subsection does not affect how this Subdivision applies for the individual's actual circumstances. See section 960100.

    * (3) If you are not an individual, treat yourself as being an individual for the purposes of applying this Subdivision in relation to the *CGT event.

    * (4) If the *CGT asset, or your *ownership interest in it, *passed to you as a beneficiary in a deceased estate:

      * (a) treat the deceased as never having used the applicable *dwelling for the *purpose of producing assessable income; and

      * (b) treat the dwelling as being the deceased's main residence on each day during the deceased's *ownership period;

    * for the purposes of applying this Subdivision in relation to the *CGT event.

##### 118220  Exemption available to trustee--after the principal beneficiary's death

    * This section applies to you in relation to a *CGT event if:

      * (a) the trustee of a trust holds a *CGT asset on a particular day (the **_transition day_**); and

      * (b) on the transition day, or on an earlier day on which the CGT asset was held by the trustee of the trust, the trust is a *special disability trust; and

      * (c) the individual who is or has been the *principal beneficiary of the trust dies on the transition day; and

      * (d) the CGT event happens in relation to the CGT asset at or after the deceased's death; and

      * (e) the CGT event happens while you hold the CGT asset:

        * (i) as trustee of the trust; or

        * (ii) as trustee of an implied trust arising because of the deceased's death.

##### 118222  Exemption available to other beneficiary who acquires the CGT asset after the principal beneficiary's death

    * This section applies to you in relation to a *CGT event if:

      * (a) the CGT event happens in relation to a *CGT asset; and

      * (b) you *acquired the CGT asset or your *ownership interest in it:

        * (i) as a result of an earlier CGT event; and

        * (ii) as a beneficiary of a trust; and

      * (c) section 118220 applied to the trustee of the trust in relation to the earlier CGT event and the CGT asset.

##### 118225  Amount of exemption available after the principal beneficiary's death--general

    * Full exemption for trustee unless sells asset for proceeds etc.

    * (1) A *capital gain or *capital loss you make from a *CGT event is disregarded if:

      * (a) section 118220 applies to you in relation to the CGT event; and

      * (b) as a result of the CGT event, an entity *acquires the *CGT asset:

        * (i) as trustee of an implied trust arising because of the deceased's death; or

        * (ii) as a beneficiary of the relevant trust referred to in paragraph 118220(e).

    * Exemption for beneficiary, or trustee selling asset for proceeds etc.

    * (2) If:

      * (a) section 118220 applies to you in relation to a *CGT event, but paragraph (1)(b) does not; or

      * (b) section 118222 applies to you in relation to a CGT event;

    * the amount of the *capital gain or *capital loss that you would have made apart from this section from the CGT event is decreased by an amount that is reasonable.

    * (3) In determining what is a reasonable decrease:

      * (a) if section 118220 applies to you, but paragraph (1)(b) does not--treat yourself as being an individual who owned the *CGT asset as the trustee of the deceased's estate; and

      * (b) if section 118222 applies to you--treat yourself as being an individual and treat the CGT asset or your *ownership interest in it as having *passed to you as a beneficiary in the deceased's estate; and

      * (c) have regard to the principles in this Subdivision, and to:

        * (i) the extent that the applicable *dwelling was the deceased's main residence for the relevant period; and

        * (ii) the extent that the dwelling was used for the *purpose of producing assessable income during the relevant period.

    * (4) For the purposes of subparagraph (3)(c)(i), assume the *dwelling was not the deceased's main residence on each day the trust referred to in paragraph 118220(b) was not a *special disability trust.

##### 118227  Amount of exemption available after the principal beneficiary's death--cost base and reduced cost base

    * (1) If section 118220 applies to you and:

      * (a) the applicable *dwelling was the deceased's main residence just before the deceased's death; and

      * (b) that dwelling was not then being used for the *purpose of producing assessable income; and

      * (c) the trust referred to in paragraph 118220(b) was then a *special disability trust;

    * then: 

      * (d) the first element of the *CGT asset's *cost base, in your hands, is the CGT asset's *market value just before the deceased's death; and

      * (e) the first element of the CGT asset's *reduced cost base, in your hands, is worked out similarly.

    * (2) However, if section 118220 applies to you as trustee of an implied trust arising because of the deceased's death, but subsection (1) does not, then:

      * (a) the first element of the *CGT asset's *cost base, in your hands, is the CGT asset's cost base just before the deceased's death; and

      * (b) the first element of the CGT asset's *reduced cost base, in your hands, is worked out similarly.

    * (3) If section 118222 applies to you:

      * (a) the first element of the *CGT asset's *cost base, in your hands, is the CGT asset's cost base just before the earlier *CGT event happened that resulted in you *acquiring the CGT asset or your *ownership interest in it; and

      * (b) the first element of the CGT asset's *reduced cost base, in your hands, is worked out similarly.

##### 118230  Application of CGT events E5 and E7 in relation to main residence exemption and special disability trusts

    * If *CGT event E5 or E7 happens in relation to a *CGT asset held by a trust that is or has been a *special disability trust, treat the lists of CGT events in paragraphs 118110(2)(a) and 118195(2)(a) as including a reference to that CGT event.

##### Compulsory acquisitions of adjacent land only

          * (b) a dwelling that passed to you as a beneficiary, or trustee, of a deceased estate;

    * to the extent that the land was used primarily for private or domestic purposes in association with the dwelling.

    * There is a limit on the maximum area of land covered by the exemption.

          * Note: The exemption may not apply in full if the dwelling:

            * (a) was not always a main residence; or

            * (b) was used for the purpose of producing assessable income.

        * (iii) you own your ownership interest in the dwelling as the trustee of a deceased estate; and

      * (f) the sum of the following is 2 hectares or less:

        * (i) the area of all of the dwelling's adjacent land at the time of the CGT event;

        * (ii) the area of the land immediately under the dwelling;

        * (iii) if this section applied to you for an earlier CGT event that involved reducing the area of the dwelling's adjacent land at the time of that earlier CGT event--that reduction in area.

          * Note: You may get only a partial exemption for the gain or loss (see section 118260).

    * Total adjacent land is more than 2 hectares

    * (2) If:

      * (a) apart from paragraph (1)(f), subsection (1) would apply to the gain or loss; and

    * Your **_maximum exempt area_** for the *CGT event and the *dwelling is 2 hectares less the amount worked out as follows:

Method statement

        * Step 1.	Identify each earlier *CGT event (if any) that:

          * (a) happened in relation to land that was part of the *dwelling's *adjacent land at the time of the earlier CGT event, or happened in relation to your *ownership interest in that land at that time; and

          * (b) resulted in you losing rights to the substantial use and enjoyment of that land either completely or for at least 10 years;

        * for which you made a *capital gain or *capital loss that was wholly or partly disregarded because of the application of subsection 118245(2).

        * Step 2.	For each earlier *CGT event covered by step 1, work out the area of the exempt land for that application of subsection 118245(2).

        * Step 3.	Add the results from step 2 to the area of the land immediately under the *dwelling.

##### 118260  Partial exemption rules

    * (1) If section 118245 applies to a *CGT event, the amount of the *capital gain or *capital loss that you would have made apart from this section from the CGT event is increased by an amount that is reasonable having regard to the following:

      * (a) the extent that the *dwelling was not a main residence for the relevant period;

      * (b) the extent that the dwelling was used for the *purpose of producing assessable income during the relevant period.

##### Subdivision 118D--Insurance and superannuation

##### Table of sections

       * 118300	Insurance policies

       * 118305	Superannuation

       * 118310	RSA's

       * 118313	Superannuation agreements under the Family Law Act

       * 118315	Segregated exempt assets of life insurance companies

       * 118320	Segregated current pension assets of a complying superannuation entity

##### 118300  Insurance policies

           * Example 1: Brian (as the insured) receives an insurance payment from his insurer for the destruction of a building he owned as an investment. The payment constitutes capital proceeds on the destruction (CGT event C1). The discharge of the insurance policy (CGT event C2) has no CGT consequences.

    * Payment to trust beneficiary (or representative) if trustee owns the policy or instrument

    * (1A) A *capital gain or *capital loss you make from a *CGT event happening because you receive a *CGT asset from the trustee of a trust is disregarded if:

          * Note: The full list of CGT events is in section 1045.

##### 118305  Superannuation

    * (1) A *capital gain or *capital loss is disregarded if you make it from a *CGT event happening in relation to any of the following:

      * (a) a right to an allowance, annuity or capital amount payable out of a *superannuation fund or *approved deposit fund;

      * (b) a right to an asset of such a fund;

      * (c) a right to any part of such an allowance, annuity, capital amount or asset.

          * Example: Angela retires from her employment and receives a lump sum payment from her superannuation fund. This is an example of CGT event C2 (her rights to receive the payment ending). There are no CGT consequences for Angela.

    * (2) However, this exemption is not available if:

      * (a) you are the trustee of the fund and a *CGT event happens in relation to a *CGT asset of the fund; or

      * (b) an entity receives a payment or property where:

      * (a) the making of a superannuation agreement (within the meaning of Part VIIIB of the _Family Law Act 1975_);

      * (b) the termination, or setting aside, of such an agreement;

      * (c) such an agreement otherwise coming to an end.

##### 118315  Segregated exempt assets of life insurance companies

    * A *capital gain or *capital loss that a *life insurance company makes from a *CGT event happening in relation to a *segregated exempt asset is disregarded.

##### 118320  Segregated current pension assets of a complying superannuation entity

    * A *capital gain or *capital loss that a *complying superannuation entity makes from a *CGT event happening in relation to a *segregated current pension asset is disregarded.

##### Subdivision 118E--Units in pooled superannuation trusts

##### 118350  Units in pooled superannuation trusts

    * (1) A *capital gain or *capital loss an entity makes from a *CGT event happening in relation to a unit in a unit trust is disregarded if:

      * (a) the trust is a *pooled superannuation trust for the income year in which the event happened; and

      * (b) one of the conditions in subsection (2) is satisfied.

##### Subdivision 118F--Venture capital investment

##### Guide to Subdivision 118F

##### 118400  What this Subdivision is about

    * You can ignore capital gains and capital losses from CGT events that relate to investments, in Australian companies and unit trusts (and in some cases foreign holding companies), that meet the requirements of this Subdivision.

    * These investments are made: 

          * (a) through limited partnerships, known as venture capital limited partnerships or early stage venture capital limited partnerships, that are unconditionally registered under Part 2 of the _Venture Capital Act 2002_; or

          * (b) through limited partnerships, known as Australian venture capital funds of funds, that are unconditionally registered under that Part; or

          * (c) directly by foreign residents who are registered under Part 3 of that Act.

    * However, unless investments are made through early stage venture capital limited partnerships, you must be a foreign resident for this Subdivision to apply.

          * Note: Registration of a limited partnership under Part 2 of that Act also leads to its income and losses being assessed under Division 5 of Part III of the _Income Tax Assessment Act 1936_ on the basis that it is a partnership.

          * This is an exception to the general rule, under Division 5A of that Part, that limited partnerships are assessed as companies.

    * General

    * (1) All of your share in a *capital gain or a *capital loss from a *CGT event is disregarded if:

          * Note: The registration requirements of a VCLP are set out in section 91 of the _Venture Capital Act 2002_. It is important to understand that this is a separate requirement from registration under Part 2 of that Act (which effectively determines whether an entity is a VCLP).

          * It is technically possible to be registered under Part 2 of that Act without meeting the registration requirements of a VCLP, but you might still not be entitled to exemption under this section.

    * Meaning of venture capital limited partnership

    * (2) A *limited partnership is a **_venture capital limited partnership_** at a particular time if, at that time, the partnership's registration as a venture capital limited partnership under Part 2 of the _Venture Capital Act 2002_ is, or is taken to have been, in force.

          * For when the registration is, or is taken to have been, in force, see section 1310 of the _Venture Capital Act 2002_.

    * (4) A partnership that acquired a unit in a unit trust by converting a *convertible note issued by or on behalf of the trustee of the unit trust is treated, for the purposes of subparagraph (1)(d)(ii), as having owned the unit from the time when it last acquired the convertible note.

    * (5) Subsection (3) or (4) applies whether or not the acquisition of the *convertible note, or convertible preference share, was an *eligible venture capital investment.

    * (6) A partnership that converts a *convertible note into a share or a unit is treated, for the purposes of subparagraph (1)(d)(ii), as continuing to own the convertible note until the partnership no longer owns the share or unit.

          * Note: The registration requirements of an ESVCLP are set out in section 93 of the _Venture Capital Act 2002_. It is important to understand that this is a separate requirement from registration under Part 2 of that Act (which effectively determines whether an entity is an ESVCLP).

          * It is technically possible to be registered under Part 2 of that Act without meeting the registration requirements of an ESVCLP, but you might still not be entitled to exemption under this section.

    * Meaning of early stage venture capital limited partnership

    * (4) A *limited partnership is an **_early stage venture capital limited partnership_** at a particular time if, at that time, the partnership's registration as an early stage venture capital limited partnership under Part 2 of the _Venture Capital Act 2002_ is, or is taken to have been, in force.

          * Note 1: For when the registration is, or is taken to have been, in force, see section 1310 of the _Venture Capital Act 2002_.

          * Note 2: In this Act and the _Venture Capital Act 2002_, the term "early stage venture capital limited partnership" is usually abbreviated to "ESVCLP".

    * Temporary exemption from meeting the divestiture registration requirement

    * (5) A partnership is treated, for the purposes of subsection (1), as never having failed, during a particular income year of the partnership, to meet the *divestiture registration requirement in relation to a particular investment that the partnership holds, if:

      * (a) at the start of the income year, the partnership fails to meet the divestiture registration requirement in relation to that investment; and

      * (b) the partnership meets the divestiture registration requirement in relation to that investment:

    * Gains or losses as a partner in a VCLP or an ESVCLP

    * (1) All of your share in a *capital gain or a *capital loss from a *CGT event is disregarded if:

      * (a) you are an *eligible venture capital partner in a *limited partnership; and

    * Scrip for scrip investments

    * (9) However, a unit trust is taken to meet the requirements of subsections (3) to (8) if:

      * (b) at the time that the *VCLP, *ESVCLP, *AFOF or *eligible venture capital investor in question acquired the units being exchanged, the other unit trust meets the requirements of subsections (3) to (8), but not only because this subsection applies to the other unit trust; and

      * (c) the units in the other unit trust that are being exchanged are all of the units in the other unit trust that the entity making the investment owned at the time of the exchange.

    * Debt interests

    * (12) If a group of entities:

      * (a) is treated as a *consolidated group because of a choice that a unit trust has made under section 713130; or

      * (b) would be treated as a consolidated group because of such a choice:

        * (i) if a unit trust were to make such a choice; or

        * (ii) if a unit trust that is not a *corporate unit trust or a *public trading trust were such a trust and were to make such a choice;

    * this section applies in relation to the entities as if: 

      * (c) the unit trust carried on, as the *head company of the consolidated group or consolidatable group, all of the activities that are carried on by the other members of the group; and

      * (d) the assets, employees and income of the other members of the group were assets, employees and income of the unit trust; and

      * (e) each of the other members of the group were parts of the unit trust rather than separate entities.

    * Exception to requirements relating to location within Australia

    * (13) A unit trust is taken to meet the requirements of subsection (3) in relation to an investment made by an entity if the sum of:

      * (a) the value of the investment at the time the entity makes it; and

      * (b) the total value of all the other investments that the entity owns at that time that do not, or apart from this subsection would not, meet those requirements;

    * does not exceed 20% of the partnership's *committed capital.

          * Note: See subsection (11) for the value of investments.

    * Ineligible activities

    * (14) These activities are ineligible activities:

      * (e) making investments, whether made directly or indirectly, that are directed to deriving income in the nature of interest, rents, dividends, royalties or lease payments.

    * For the purposes of this subsection, activities that are ancillary or incidental to a particular activity are taken to form part of that activity.

    * Innovation Australia discretion

    * (15) A unit trust is taken to meet the requirements of subsection (4) even if it fails to satisfy at least 2 of the requirements in that subsection if *Innovation Australia determines under section 2515 of the _Venture Capital Act 2002_ that:

      * (a) the unit trust's primary activity is not an ineligible activity mentioned in subsection (14); and

      * (b) the failure is temporary and did not exist at the time the investment referred to in subsection (1) was made and, if it has been disposed of, when it was disposed of.

    * Convertible notes

    * (16) To the extent that an investment by an entity consists of the acquisition of a unit in a unit trust by converting a *convertible note issued by or on behalf of the trustee of the unit trust, the investment is, for the purpose of determining whether the unit trust meets the requirements of subsections (3) to (8), taken to have been made at the time when the entity last acquired the convertible note.

    * (17) Subsection (16) applies whether or not the acquisition of the *convertible note was an *eligible venture capital investment.

      * (b) the total value of the assets of any other entity *connected with the entity to the extent that they are not reflected in the value of any assets referred to in paragraph (a).

          * Note: The time the entity makes the investment is, for a share acquired by converting a convertible note or convertible preference share or for a unit in a unit trust acquired by converting a convertible note, the time when the entity last acquired the convertible note or convertible preference share: see subsections 118425(15) and 118427(16).

    * (2) The total value of the assets of an entity is the total value of its assets (both current and noncurrent) as shown in:

      * (a) the last audited accounts prepared for the entity for the purposes of the _Corporations Act 2001_ that relates to a period ending less than 18 months before that time; or

    * (4) In applying paragraphs (1)(b), (5)(b) and (7)(c), ignore the total value of the assets of an entity that, immediately after the investment is made, is not *connected with the target entity.

    * (6) The Commissioner may determine that subsection (5) does not apply if the Commissioner is satisfied that:

      * (a) the activities of the target entity are not the same as, not an integral part of and not a necessary support for the activities of the linked entity; and

      * (b) the making of the investment in the target entity is not part of a *scheme to acquire interests in all or a substantial part of a group of companies that are *connected with each other.

    * (8) In applying paragraphs (5)(b) and (7)(c), ignore the total value of the assets of an entity that is *connected with the linked entity either immediately before or immediately after the investment in the linked entity if it is so connected only because of *eligible venture capital investments made in both of those entities by the same *VCLP, *ESVCLP, *AFOF or *eligible venture capital investor.

##### 118515  Meaning of venture capital entity

      * (b) the partnership is a *limited partnership and:

        * (i) all of the partners in it (except its general partner or managing partner) are venture capital entities under subsection (1); and

        * (ii) its general partner or managing partner has interests in less than 10% of the total value of the assets of the partnership.

##### 118520  Meaning of superannuation fund for foreign residents

    * (1) A fund is a **_superannuation fund for foreign residents_** at a time if:

      * (a) at that time, it is:

        * (i) an indefinitely continuing fund; and

        * (ii) a provident, benefit, superannuation or retirement fund; and

      * (b) it was established in a foreign country; and

      * (d) at that time, its central management and control is carried on outside Australia by entities none of whom is an Australian resident.

    * (2) However, a fund is not a **_superannuation fund for foreign residents_** if:

      * (a) an amount paid to the fund or set aside for the fund has been or can be deducted under this Act; or

      * (b) a *tax offset has been allowed or is allowable for such an amount.

##### 118525  Meaning of venture capital equity

    * (1) A *CGT asset is **_venture capital equity_** for a *venture capital entity if it is a *share in a company or an interest in a trust where:

      * (a) the company or trust is a *resident investment vehicle; and

      * (b) the share or interest was issued or allotted to the entity by the company or trust; and

      * (c) the entity was at risk in owning the share or interest in that it had no *arrangement (either before or after the share or interest was issued or allotted) as to:

        * (i) the maintenance of the value of the share or interest; or

        * (ii) any earnings or other return that might be made from owning it; or

        * (iii) protection from commercial loss because of owning it.

          * Example: A company borrows money to purchase some shares. The terms of the loan include a term that, if the value of the shares falls below the amount of the loan, the company can repay the loan by transferring the shares to the lender.

          * The company's ownership of the shares is not at risk, because there is no possibility that it can lose money under the transaction.

    * (2) However, *shares or interests in the *resident investment vehicle issued or allotted to a *venture capital entity are not **_venture capital equity_** for the entity if:

      * (a) one or more of these events happens:

        * (i) a share or interest in the resident investment vehicle that was *acquired by some other entity before that issue or allotment is cancelled or redeemed; or

        * (ii) there is a return of some of the capital of the resident investment vehicle that was acquired before that issue or allotment; or

        * (iii) value is shifted out of a share or interest in that vehicle that was acquired before that issue or allotment; and

      * (b) it is reasonable to conclude that the happening of the event referred to in paragraph (a) is connected to that issue or allotment, or to some *arrangement between the entities concerned.

          * Example: The capital of an Australian company is 100,000 shares, with a market value of $1 per share. The shares have full voting and dividend rights.

          * The Australian company issues another 100,000 shares to a foreign company. The new shares are issued at one cent each, but have very limited voting and dividend rights.

          * The Australian company then changes the rights attaching to its shares so that the new shares have full voting and dividend rights, and the original shares have none.

          * Value has been shifted out of the original shares, effectively converting "old equity" to "new equity".

    * (3) In deciding whether it is reasonable to reach the conclusion referred to in paragraph (2)(b), these matters are relevant:

      * (a) whether the amount of the decrease in the *net value of the *resident investment vehicle because of the happening of the event referred to in paragraph (2)(a) is the same as, or is calculated by reference to, the value of the issue or allotment of *shares or interests to the *venture capital entity; and

      * (b) the time lapse between the happening of that event and that issue or allotment.

##### Subdivision 118H--Demutualisation of Tower Corporation

##### 118550  Demutualisation of Tower Corporation

    * (2) Disregard any *capital gain or *capital loss that resulted from any of your membership rights in Tower Corporation ceasing to exist when that entity ceased to be a mutual entity.

          * Note: Subsection (2) applies to you even if, because you could not be located at the time of demutualisation, you were not immediately issued with shares in the demutualised entity in substitution for your old membership rights, and rights to shares were instead put aside in a trust.

    * Cost base of replacement assets

    * (3) The *cost base and the *reduced cost base of any *shares or other *CGT assets that you *acquire in substitution for the membership rights that have ceased to exist do not include any amounts that you paid in acquiring or maintaining those old rights.

#### Division 121--Record keeping 

##### Guide to Division 121

##### 12110  What this Division is about

    * You must keep records of matters that affect the capital gains and losses you make. You must retain them for 5 years after the last relevant CGT event.

##### Table of sections

  * Operative provisions

       * 12120	What records you must keep

       * 12125	How long you must retain the records

       * 12130	Exceptions

       * 12135	Asset register entries

##### Operative provisions

##### 12120  What records you must keep

    * (1) You must keep records of every act, transaction, event or circumstance that can reasonably be expected to be relevant to working out whether you have made a *capital gain or *capital loss from a *CGT event. (It does not matter whether the CGT event has already happened or may happen in the future.)

          * Note 1: There are exceptions: see section 12130.

          * Example 1: You dispose of a CGT asset. The records that are relevant to working out your capital gain or loss are records of:

            *  	the date you acquired the asset;

            *  	the date you disposed of it;

            *  	each element of its cost base and reduced cost base and the effect of indexation on those elements;

            *  	what you sold it for (the capital proceeds).

          * Example 2: Company A disposes of a CGT asset it acquired from company B (a member of the same whollyowned group and a foreign resident) where company B obtained a rollover under Subdivision 126B. In addition to the records mentioned in example 1, company A needs records showing:

            *  	the status of the 2 companies as members of the group;

            *  	which company is the ultimate holding company in the group;

            *  	the cost base and reduced cost base of the asset in the hands of company B just before the rollover (because these become company A's cost base and reduced cost base).

          * Example 3: CGT event G2 (about shifts in share values) happens involving company X and Greg (a controller (for CGT purposes) of company X). Z Nominees Pty Ltd (an associate of Greg's) suffers a material decrease in the value of its shares in company X as a result of the shift. Z Nominees needs records showing:

            *  	the essential elements of the relevant scheme;

            *  	the date when the share value shift occurred;

            *  	the amounts of the decreases and increases in the market values of all shares involved in the scheme;

            *  	if shares are issued at a discount under the scheme, the amount of the discount;

            *  	the cost bases and market values of the shares that decreased in value.

          * Note 2: There is an administrative penalty if you do not keep records as required by this Division: see section 28825 in Schedule 1 to the _Taxation Administration Act 1953_.

    * (2) The records must be in English, or be readily accessible and convertible into English. They must show what is described in this section. (They **_show_** something if they include whatever material is necessary for that thing to be easily identified or worked out.)

    * (3) They must show the nature of the act, transaction, event or circumstance, the day when it happened or arose and:

      * (a) in the case of an act--who did it; and 

      * (b) in the case of a transaction--who were the parties to it. 

    * (4) They must show details (including relevant amounts) of how the act, transaction, event or circumstance is relevant (or can reasonably be expected to be relevant) to working out whether you have made a *capital gain or *capital loss from a *CGT event.

    * (5) If the necessary records of an act, transaction, event or circumstance do not already exist, you must reconstruct them or have someone else reconstruct them.

          * Example: Your capital gain or capital loss from a CGT event may depend on the market value of property at a particular time. To record that market value properly, you may need to get a valuation done.

        * Penalty: 30 penalty units.

          * Note: See section 4AA of the _Crimes Act 1914_ for the current value of a penalty unit.

    * (6) An offence under this section is an offence of strict liability.

          * Note: For **_strict liability_**, see section 6.1 of the _Criminal Code_.

##### 12125  How long you must retain the records

    * (1) You must retain records that section 12120 requires you to keep.

    * (2) You must retain them until the end of 5 years after it becomes certain that no *CGT event (or no further *CGT event) can happen such that the records could reasonably be expected to be relevant to working out whether you have made a *capital gain or *capital loss from the event.

    * (2A) An offence under this section is an offence of strict liability.

          * Note: For **_strict liability_**, see section 6.1 of the _Criminal Code_.

    * (3) This section has effect despite subsection 262A(4) of the _Income Tax Assessment Act 1936_ (which requires records to be retained for a different period).

    * (4) However, it is not necessary to retain records:

      * (a) if the Commissioner notifies you that you do not need to retain them; or

      * (b) for a company that has finally ceased to exist.

          * Note 1: There are special record keeping rules where there has been a rollover for a merger between superannuation funds under former section 160ZZPI of the _Income Tax Assessment Act 1936_: see section 12125 of the _Income Tax (Transitional Provisions) Act 1997_.

        * Penalty: 30 penalty units.

          * Note 2: See section 4AA of the _Crimes Act 1914_ for the current value of a penalty unit.

##### 12130  Exceptions

    * (1) You do not need to keep records under section 12120 if:

      * (a) for each *CGT event (if any) that has happened such that the records are relevant (or could reasonably be expected to be relevant) to working out whether you have made a *capital gain or *capital loss from the event; and

      * (b) for each *CGT event that may happen in the future such that the records could reasonably be expected to be relevant to working out whether you might make a *capital gain or *capital loss from the event;

    * any capital gain or capital loss you made (or might make) from it is to be (or would be) disregarded, except because of a rollover.

    * (2) However, the exceptions in this section do not apply to a *CGT event as a result of which a *capital gain or *capital loss is disregarded under section 85540 (about capital gains and losses of foreign residents through *fixed trusts).

##### 12135  Asset register entries

    * (1) You satisfy a requirement under this Division to retain records for a period if you:

      * (a) retain for that period an entry in a register for the records that satisfies the requirements in subsection (2), or a combination of the records and such an entry for them, containing all the information required to be contained in the records; and

      * (b) retain those of the records that contain the information entered in the register for at least 5 years after the requirement in paragraph (2)(b) is satisfied.

    * (2) The requirements are:

      * (a) you must make an entry in a register, in English, setting out some or all of the information contained in the records; and

      * (b) another entity who is a *registered tax agent or some other person approved by the Commissioner must certify in the register that the information entered is information from those records.

##### When is a rollover available

##### 12215  Disposal or creation of assets--whollyowned company

    * If you are an individual or a trustee, you can choose to obtain a rollover if one of the *CGT events (the **_trigger event_**) specified in this table happens involving you and a company in the circumstances set out in sections 12220 to 12235.

          * Note 1: The rollover starts at section 12240.

          * Note 2: Section 10325 tells you when you have to make the choice.

          * Example: Gavin runs a plumbing business. He wants to incorporate it so he disposes of all its assets to a company. He becomes the sole shareholder of the company.

##### 12220  What you receive for the trigger event

    * (1) The consideration you receive for the trigger event happening must be only:

      * (a) *shares in the company; or

      * (b) for a *disposal of a *CGT asset, or all the assets of a business, to the company (a **_disposal case_**)--shares in the company and the company undertaking to discharge one or more liabilities in respect of the asset or assets of the *business (as appropriate).

          * Note: There are rules for working out what are the liabilities in respect of an asset: see section 12237.

    * (2) The *shares cannot be *redeemable shares.

    * (3) The *market value of the *shares you receive for the trigger event happening must be substantially the same as:

      * (a) for a disposal case--the market value of the asset or assets you disposed of, less any liabilities the company undertakes to discharge in respect of the asset or assets (as appropriate); or

      * (b) for another trigger event (a **_creation case_**)--the market value of the CGT asset created in the company (the **_created asset_**).

    * (4) In working out if the requirement in paragraph (3)(a) is satisfied, if the *market value of the *shares is different to what it would otherwise be only because of the possibility of liabilities attaching to the asset or assets, disregard the difference.

          * Note: The company may have to pay income tax if an amount is included in its assessable income because of a CGT event happening to an asset you disposed of, or it may have a liability because of accrued leave entitlements of employees. The market value of the shares will reflect these contingent liabilities.

##### 12225  Other requirements to be satisfied

    * (1) You must own all the *shares in the company just after the time of the trigger event.

          * Note: You must own the shares in the same capacity as you owned or created the assets that the company now owns.

    * (2) This Subdivision does not apply to the *disposal or creation of any of the assets specified in this table:

    * (3) A precluded asset is:

      * (a) a *depreciating asset; or

      * (b) *trading stock; or

      * (c) an interest in the copyright in a *film referred to in section 11830; or

      * (d) a *registered emissions unit.

    * (4) If:

      * (a) the *CGT asset or any of the assets of the *business is a right, option, *convertible interest or *exchangeable interest; and

      * (b) the company *acquires another CGT asset by exercising the right or option or by converting the convertible interest or in exchange for the disposal or redemption of the exchangeable interest;

    * the other asset cannot become *trading stock of the company just after the company acquired it.

    * (5) The *ordinary income and *statutory income of the company must not be exempt from income tax because it is an *exempt entity for the income year of the trigger event.

    * (6) If you are an individual at the time of the trigger event, either:

      * (a) you and the company must both be Australian residents at that time; or

      * (b) both of the following requirements must be satisfied:

        * (i) each asset must be *taxable Australian property at that time;

        * (ii) the shares in the company mentioned in subsection 12220(1) must be taxable Australian property just after that time.

    * (7) If you are a trustee of a trust at the time of the trigger event, either:

      * (a) at that time, the trust must be a *resident trust for CGT purposes and the company must be an Australian resident; or

      * (b) both of the following requirements must be satisfied:

        * (i) each *CGT asset must be a CGT asset of the trust that is *taxable Australian property at that time; and

        * (ii) the shares in the company mentioned in subsection 12220(1) must be taxable Australian property just after that time.

##### 12235  What if the company undertakes to discharge a liability (disposal case)

    * Disposal of a CGT asset

    * (1) One of the requirements in this table must be satisfied if:

      * (a) you *dispose of a *CGT asset; and

      * (b) the company undertakes to discharge one or more liabilities in respect of it.

    * (The *market value, or the *cost base, of an asset is worked out when you disposed of it.)

          * Note: There are rules for working out what are the liabilities in respect of an asset: see section 12237.

    * Disposal of all the assets of a business

    * (2) One of the requirements in this table must be satisfied if:

      * (a) you *dispose of all the assets of a *business; and

      * (b) the company undertakes to discharge one or more liabilities in respect of the assets of the business.

    * (The *market value, or the *cost base, of an asset is worked out when you disposed of it.)

##### 12237  Rules for working out what a liability in respect of an asset is

    * (1) These rules are relevant to working out what are the liabilities in respect of an asset.

    * (2) A liability incurred for the purposes of a *business that is not a liability in respect of a specific asset or assets of the business is taken to be a liability in respect of all the assets of the business.

          * Note: An example is a bank overdraft.

    * (3) If a liability is in respect of 2 or more assets, the proportion of the liability that is in respect of any one of those assets is equal to:

##### Replacementasset rollover if you dispose of a CGT asset

##### 12240  Disposal of a CGT asset

    * (1) If you choose a rollover, a *capital gain or *capital loss you make from the trigger event is disregarded.

    * (2) If you *acquired the asset on or after 20 September 1985:

      * (a) the first element of each *share's *cost base is the asset's cost base when you *disposed of it (less any liabilities the company undertakes to discharge in respect of it) divided by the number of shares; and

      * (b) the first element of each share's *reduced cost base is worked out similarly.

          * Note 1: There are rules for working out what are the liabilities in respect of an asset: see section 12237.

          * Note 2: There are special indexation rules for rollovers: see Division 114.

    * (3) If you *acquired the asset before 20 September 1985, you are taken to have acquired the *shares before that day.

##### Replacementasset rollover if you dispose of all the assets of a business

##### 12245  Disposal of all the assets of a business

    * (1) If you choose a rollover for *disposing of all the assets of a *business to the company, a *capital gain or *capital loss you make from each of the assets of the business is disregarded.

    * (2) The other consequences relate to the *shares you receive and depend on when you *acquired the assets of the *business.

          * Note 1: There are 3 possible cases:

            *  	 you acquired all the assets on or after 20 September 1985: see section 12250;

            *  	 you acquired all the assets before that day: see section 12255;

            *  	 you acquired some of the assets on or after that day: see section 12260.

          * Note 2: There are special indexation rules for rollovers: see Division 114.

          * Note 3: There are other consequences for you and the company if you dispose of trading stock: see Division 70.

##### 12250  All assets acquired on or after 20 September 1985

    * (1) If you *acquired all of the assets of the *business on or after 20 September 1985:

      * (a) the first element of each *share's *cost base is the sum of the *market values of the *precluded assets and the cost bases of the other assets (less any liabilities the company undertakes to discharge in respect of all of those assets) divided by the number of shares; and

      * (b) the first element of each share's *reduced cost base is worked out similarly.

          * Note 1: There are rules for working out what are the liabilities in respect of an asset: see section 12237.

          * Note 2: There are special indexation rules for rollovers: see Division 114.

          * Example: Nick is a small trader. He wants to incorporate his business. He disposes of all its assets to a company and receives 10 shares in return.

          * Nick acquired all the assets of the business after 20 September 1985.

          * Trading stock, plant and equipment and office furniture are precluded assets.

          * The market value of Nick's trading stock when he disposed of it is $20,000. The market value of his plant and equipment at that time is $50,000 and the market value of his office furniture at that time is $10,000.

          * The cost bases of Nick's land and buildings at that time total $120,000.

          * Nick has a business overdraft of $15,000. It is taken to be a liability in respect of all the assets of his business.

          * The first element of the cost base of the 10 shares is: 

          * The first element of the reduced cost base of the 10 shares is worked out similarly.

    * (2) The *market value of an asset is worked out when you *disposed of it. The *cost base or *reduced cost base of an asset is worked out at the same time.

##### 12255  All assets acquired before 20 September 1985

    * (1) You are taken to have *acquired all of the *shares before 20 September 1985 if you acquired all the assets of the *business before that day and none of the assets is a *precluded asset.

    * (2) However, if at least one of the assets is a *precluded asset, you are taken to have *acquired a whole number of the *shares (but not all of them) before that day. The number is the greatest possible that (when expressed as a percentage of all the shares) does not exceed:

       *  	the total of the *market values of the assets that are not *precluded assets, less any liabilities the company undertakes to discharge in respect of those assets;

    * expressed as a percentage of: 

       *  	the total of the market values of all the assets, less any liabilities the company undertakes to discharge in respect of those assets.

          * Note: There are rules for working out what are the liabilities in respect of an asset: see section 12237.

    * (3) The first element of each other *share's *cost base and *reduced cost base is the total of the *market values of the *precluded assets (less any liabilities the company undertakes to discharge in respect of those assets) divided by the number of those other shares.

    * (4) The *market value of an asset is worked out when you *disposed of it. The *cost base or *reduced cost base of an asset is worked out at the same time.

##### 12260  Assets acquired before and after 20 September 1985

    * (1) If you *acquired some of the assets on or after 20 September 1985, you are taken to have acquired a whole number of the *shares (but not all of them) before that day. The number is the greatest possible that (when expressed as a percentage of all the shares) does not exceed:

       *  	the total of the *market values of the assets (except any *precluded assets) that you acquired before that day, less any liabilities the company undertakes to discharge in respect of those assets;

    * expressed as a percentage of: 

       *  	the total of the market values of all the assets, less any liabilities the company undertakes to discharge in respect of those assets.

    * (2) The first element of each other *share's *cost base is the sum of the *market values of the *precluded assets and the cost bases of the other assets that you *acquired on or after that day (less any liabilities the company undertakes to discharge in respect of all of those assets) divided by the number of those other shares.

          * Note: There are special indexation rules for rollovers: see Division 114.

    * (3) The first element of each other *share's *reduced cost base is worked out similarly.

    * (4) The *market value of an asset is worked out when you *disposed of it. The *cost base or *reduced cost base of an asset is worked out at the same time.

##### Replacementasset rollover for a creation case

##### 12265  Creation of asset

    * (1) If you choose a rollover, a *capital gain or *capital loss you make from the trigger event is disregarded.

    * (2) The first element of each *share's *cost base is the amount applicable under this table divided by the number of shares. The first element of each share's *reduced cost base is worked out similarly.

    *  The expenditure can include a transfer of property: see section 1035.

          * Example: Bill grants a licence (CGT event D1) to Tiffin Pty Ltd (a company he owns). The company issues him with 2 additional shares. He incurs legal expenses of $1,000 to grant the licence.

          * Bill's cost base for each of the shares is $500.

##### Sameasset rollover consequences for the company (disposal case)

##### 12270  Consequences for the company (disposal case)

    * (1) There are these consequences for the company in a disposal case if you choose to obtain a rollover. They are relevant for each *CGT asset (except a *precluded asset) that you *disposed of to the company.

          * Note: A capital gain or loss from a precluded asset can be disregarded: see Subdivision 118A.

    * Asset acquired on or after 20 September 1985

    * (2) If you *acquired the asset on or after 20 September 1985:

      * (a) the first element of the asset's *cost base (in the hands of the company) is the asset's cost base when you disposed of it; and

      * (b) the first element of the asset's *reduced cost base (in the hands of the company) is the asset's reduced cost base when you disposed of it.

          * Note 1: There are special indexation rules for rollovers: see Division 114.

          * Note 2: The reduced cost base may be modified for a rollover happening after a demerger: see section 125170.

    * Asset acquired before 20 September 1985

    * (3) If you *acquired the asset before 20 September 1985, the company is taken to have acquired it before that day.

          * Note: A capital gain or loss from a CGT asset acquired before 20 September 1985 is generally disregarded: see Division 104. This exemption is removed in some situations: see Division 149.

##### Sameasset rollover consequences for the company (creation case)

##### 12275  Consequences for the company (creation case)

    * (1) There are these consequences for the company in a creation case if you choose to obtain a rollover.

    * (2) The first element of the created asset's *cost base (in the hands of the company) is the applicable amount from the table in subsection 12265(2).

          * Example: To continue the example in section 12265, the cost base of the licence in Tiffin Pty Ltd's hands is $1,000.

    * (3) The first element of the created asset's *reduced cost base (in the hands of the company) is worked out similarly.

##### When is a rollover available

##### 122125  Disposal or creation of assets--whollyowned company

    * All of the partners in a partnership can choose to obtain a rollover if one of the *CGT events (the **_trigger event_**) specified in this table happens involving the partners and a company in the circumstances set out in sections 122130 to 122140.

          * Note 1: The rollover starts at section 122150.

          * Note 2: Section 10325 tells you when you have to make the choice.

          * Example: Michael and Sandra operate a fish shop in partnership. They agree to incorporate the business so they dispose of their interests in all its assets to a company. They are the only shareholders of the company.

##### 122130  What the partners receive for the trigger event

    * (1) The consideration the partners receive must be only:

      * (a) *shares in the company; or

      * (b) for a *disposal of their interests in a *CGT asset, or in all the assets of a business, to the company (a **_disposal case_**)--shares in the company and the company undertaking to discharge one or more liabilities in respect of their interests.

          * Note: There are rules for working out what are the liabilities in respect of an interest in an asset: see section 122145.

    * (2) The *shares cannot be *redeemable shares.

    * (3) The *market value of the *shares each partner receives for the trigger event happening must be substantially the same as:

      * (a) for a disposal case--the market value of the interests in the asset or assets the partner disposed of, less any liabilities the company undertakes to discharge in respect of the interests in the asset or assets (as appropriate); or

      * (b) for another trigger event (a **_creation case_**)--the market value of what would have been the partner's interest in the *CGT asset created in the company (the **_created asset_**) if it were an asset of the partnership.

    * (4) In working out if the requirement in paragraph (3)(a) is satisfied, if the *market value of the *shares is different to what it would otherwise be only because of the possibility of liabilities attaching to the asset or assets, disregard the difference.

          * Note: The company may have to pay income tax if an amount is included in its assessable income because of a CGT event happening to an asset a partner disposed of, or it may have a liability because of accrued leave entitlements of employees. The market value of the shares will reflect these contingent liabilities.

##### 122135  Other requirements to be satisfied

    * (1) The partners must own all the *shares in the company just after the time of the trigger event.

    * (2) Each partner must own the *shares the partner received for the trigger event happening in the same capacity that the partner:

      * (a) owned the partner's interests in the assets that the company now owns; or

      * (b) participated in the creation of the asset in the company.

          * Note: If a partner's interests were owned as trustee, the partner must receive shares as trustee.

    * (4) If:

      * (a) the *CGT asset or any of the assets of the *business is a right, option, *convertible interest or *exchangeable interest; and

      * (b) the company *acquires another CGT asset by exercising the right or option or by converting the convertible interest or in exchange for the disposal or redemption of the exchangeable interest;

    * the other asset cannot become *trading stock of the company just after the company acquired it.

    * (5) The *ordinary income and *statutory income of the company must not be exempt from income tax because it is an *exempt entity for the income year of the trigger event.

    * (6) For a partner who is not a trustee of a trust at the time of the trigger event, either:

      * (a) the partner and the company must both be Australian residents at that time; or

        * (ii) the shares in the company mentioned in subsection 122130(1) must be taxable Australian property just after that time.

##### 122140  What if the company undertakes to discharge a liability (disposal case) 

    * Disposal of a CGT asset

    * (1) One of these requirements must be satisfied (for each partner) if:

      * (a) the partners *dispose of their interests in a *CGT asset; and

      * (b) the company undertakes to discharge one or more liabilities in respect of the interests in the asset.

    * (The *market value, or the *cost base, of an interest is worked out at the time of the disposal.)

          * Note: There are rules for working out what are the liabilities in respect of an interest in an asset: see section 122145.

    * Disposal of all the assets of a business

    * (The *market value, or the *cost base, of an interest is worked out at the time of the disposal.)

##### 122145  Rules for working out what a liability in respect of an interest in an asset is

    * (1) These rules are relevant to working out what are the liabilities in respect of a partner's interests in an asset.

    * (2) A liability incurred for the purposes of a *business that is not a liability in respect of interests in a specific asset or assets of the business is taken to be a liability in respect of the partner's interests in all the assets of the business.

          * Note: An example is a bank overdraft.

    * (3) If a liability is in respect of both:

      * (a) the partner's interests in one or more assets that the partner *acquired on or after 20 September 1985; and

      * (b) the partner's interests in one or more assets that the partner acquired before that day;

    * the proportion of the liability that is in respect of the partner's interests that the partner acquired on or after that day is equal to:

##### Replacementasset rollover if partners dispose of a CGT asset

    * (1) If a partner *acquired all the partner's interests in the asset on or after 20 September 1985:

      * (a) the first element of each *share's *cost base is the sum of the cost bases of the interests when the partner *disposed of them (less any liabilities the company undertakes to discharge in respect of them) divided by the number of the partner's shares; and

      * (b) the first element of each share's *reduced cost base is worked out similarly.

          * Note 1: There are rules for working out what are the liabilities in respect of an interest in an asset: see section 122145.

          * Note 2: There are special indexation rules for rollovers: see Division 114.

The number is the greatest possible that (when expressed as a percentage of all the shares the partner acquires) does not exceed:

       *  	the *market value of the interests in the asset that the partner acquired before that day;

    * expressed as a percentage of: 

       *  	the total of the market values of all the partner's interests in the asset.

    * (2) The first element of each other *share's *cost base is the sum of the cost bases of the partner's interests that the partner *acquired on or after that day (less any liabilities the company undertakes to discharge in respect of all of those interests) divided by the number of the other shares.

          * Note: There are special indexation rules for rollovers: see Division 114.

    * (3) The first element of each other *share's *reduced cost base is worked out similarly.

    * (4) The *market value of an interest in an asset is worked out when the partner *disposed of it. The *cost base or *reduced cost base of an interest in an asset is worked out at the same time.

##### Replacementasset rollover if the partners dispose of all the assets of a business

##### 122170  Capital gain or loss disregarded

    * If the partners choose a rollover for *disposing of their interests in all the assets of a *business to the company, a *capital gain or *capital loss any partner makes from the disposal is disregarded.

##### 122175  Other consequences

    * The other consequences relate to the *shares the partners receive and depend on when they *acquired their interests in the assets of the *business.

       *  	the total of the *market values of the partner's interests in the assets that are not *precluded assets, less any liabilities the company undertakes to discharge in respect of those interests;

    * expressed as a percentage of: 

       *  	the total of the market values of the partner's interests in all the assets, less any liabilities the company undertakes to discharge in respect of those interests.
