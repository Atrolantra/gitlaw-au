##### 8  Application of Act

     * (3) This section extends to the provision of insurance cover in respect of:

#### Division 3--Remedies for nondisclosure and misrepresentations by insured

##### 27A  Certain contracts of life insurance may be treated as if they comprised 2 or more separate contracts of life insurance

     * (1) If:

      * (a) a contract of life insurance includes 2 or more groups of provisions (for example, provisions that are grouped into 2 or more separate parts); and

      * (b) each group of provisions could form a single contract of life insurance;

     * then this Division applies as if each group of provisions were a separate contract of life insurance.

     * (2) If:

      * (a) a contract of life insurance includes 2 or more groups of provisions (for example, provisions that are grouped into 2 or more separate parts); and

      * (b) because of subsection (1), this Division applies as if each group of provisions were a separate contract of life insurance; and

      * (c) the contract also includes provisions (**_related provisions_**) that relate to or affect the operation of one or more of the groups of provisions referred to in paragraph (a);

     * then the related provisions are, for the purposes of this Division, to be regarded as provisions included in each relevant separate contract of life insurance referred to in paragraph (b).

     * (3) If a contract of life insurance provides insurance cover in relation to 2 or more life insureds, this Division applies as if the insurance cover provided in relation to each life insured were provided by a separate contract of life insurance.

     * (4) If a contract of life insurance provides:

      * (a) insurance cover in relation to a life insured that is underwritten on particular terms; and

      * (b) insurance cover in relation to that life insured that:

       * (i) is not underwritten; or

       * (ii) is underwritten on different terms;

     * then this Division applies as if the insurance cover referred to in paragraph (a) and the insurance cover referred to in paragraph (b) were each provided by a separate contract of life insurance.

        * Note: The effect of this section in relation to a contract of life insurance to which subsection (1), (3) or (4) applies is that different remedies may be available to the insurer in respect of each separate contract of life insurance that is taken to exist by virtue of the relevant subsection.

##### 28  General insurance

     * (1) This section applies where the person who became the insured under a contract of general insurance upon the contract being entered into:

      * (a) failed to comply with the duty of disclosure; or

      * (b) made a misrepresentation to the insurer before the contract was entered into;

     * but does not apply where the insurer would have entered into the contract, for the same premium and on the same terms and conditions, even if the insured had not failed to comply with the duty of disclosure or had not made the misrepresentation before the contract was entered into.

     * (2) If the failure was fraudulent or the misrepresentation was made fraudulently, the insurer may avoid the contract.

     * (3) If the insurer is not entitled to avoid the contract or, being entitled to avoid the contract (whether under subsection (2) or otherwise) has not done so, the liability of the insurer in respect of a claim is reduced to the amount that would place the insurer in a position in which the insurer would have been if the failure had not occurred or the misrepresentation had not been made.

##### 29  Life insurance

     * Scope

     * (1) This section applies where the person who became the insured under a contract of life insurance upon the contract being entered into:

      * (a) failed to comply with the duty of disclosure; or

      * (b) made a misrepresentation to the insurer before the contract was entered into;

     * but does not apply where: 

      * (c) the insurer would have entered into the contract even if the insured had not failed to comply with the duty of disclosure or had not made the misrepresentation before the contract was entered into; or

      * (d) the failure or misrepresentation was in respect of the date of birth of one or more of the life insureds.

        * Note: If subsection 27A(1), (3) or (4) applies to the contract of life insurance, different remedies may be available to the insurer in respect of each separate contract of life insurance that is taken to exist by virtue of the relevant subsection.

     * Insurer may avoid contract

     * (2) If the failure was fraudulent or the misrepresentation was made fraudulently, the insurer may avoid the contract.

     * (3) If the failure was not fraudulent or the misrepresentation was not made fraudulently, the insurer may, within 3 years after the contract was entered into, avoid the contract.

     * Insurer may vary contract

     * (4) If the insurer has not avoided the contract, whether under subsection (2) or (3) or otherwise, the insurer may, by notice in writing given to the insured, vary the contract by substituting for the sum insured (including any bonuses) a sum that is not less than the sum ascertained in accordance with the formula

     * where: 

     * **_S _**is the number of dollars that is equal to the sum insured (including any bonuses).

     * **_P _**is the number of dollars that is equal to the premium that has, or to the sum of the premiums that have, become payable under the contract; and

     * **_Q_** is the number of dollars that is equal to the premium, or to the sum of the premiums, that the insurer would have been likely to have charged if the duty of disclosure had been complied with or the misrepresentation had not been made.

        * Note: This subsection applies differently in relation to a contract with a surrender value, or a contract that provides insurance cover in respect of the death of a life insured (see subsection (10)).

     * (5) In the application of subsection (4) in relation to a contract that provides for periodic payments, **_the sum insured_** means each such payment (including any bonuses).

     * (6) If the insurer has not avoided the contract or has not varied the contract under subsection (4), the insurer may, by notice in writing given to the insured, vary the contract in such a way as to place the insurer in the position (subject to subsection (7)) in which the insurer would have been if the duty of disclosure had been complied with or the misrepresentation had not been made.

        * Note: This subsection does not apply in relation to a contract with a surrender value, or a contract that provides insurance cover in respect of the death of a life insured (see subsection (10)).

     * (7) The position of the insurer under a contract (the **_relevant contract_**) that is varied under subsection (6) must not be inconsistent with the position in which other reasonable and prudent insurers would have been if:

      * (a) they had entered into similar contracts of life insurance to the relevant contract; and

      * (b) there had been no failure to comply with the duty of disclosure, and no misrepresentation, by the insureds under the similar contracts before they were entered into.

     * (8) For the purposes of subsection (7), a contract of life insurance (the **_similar contract_**) is similar to another contract of life insurance (the **_relevant contract_**) if:

      * (a) the similar contract provides insurance cover that is the same as, or similar to, the kind of insurance cover provided by the relevant contract; and

      * (b) the similar contract was entered into at, or close to, the time the relevant contract was entered into.

     * Date of effect of variation of contract

     * (9) A variation of a contract under subsection (4) or (6) has effect from the time when the contract was entered into.

     * Exception for contracts with a surrender value or that provide cover on death

     * (10) If the contract is a contract with a surrender value, or a contract that provides insurance cover in respect of the death of a life insured:

      * (a) the insurer may vary the contract under subsection (4) before the expiration of 3 years after the contract was entered into, but not after that period; and

      * (b) subsections (6), (7) and (8) do not apply in relation to the contract.

##### 30  Misstatements of age

     * (1) In this section, **_the standard formula_**, in relation to a contract of life insurance means the formula

     * where: 

     * **_S_** is the number of dollars that is equal to the sum insured (including any bonuses).

     * **_P_** is the number of dollars that is equal to the premium that has, or to the sum of the premiums that have, become payable under the contract; and

     * **_Q_** is the number of dollars that is equal to the premium, or to the sum of the premiums, that would have become payable under the contract if it or they had been ascertained on the basis of the correct date of birth or dates of birth.

     * (2) If the date of birth of one or more of the life insureds under a contract of life insurance was not correctly stated to the insurer at the time when the contract was entered into:

      * (a) where the sum insured (including any bonuses) exceeds the amount in dollars ascertained in accordance with the standard formula--the insurer may at any time vary the contract by substituting for the sum insured (including any bonuses) an amount that is not less than the amount in dollars so ascertained; and

      * (b) where the sum insured (including any bonuses) is less than the amount so ascertained, the insurer shall either:

       * (i) reduce, as from the date on which the contract was entered into, the premium payable to the amount that would have been payable if the contract had been based on the correct date of birth or correct dates of birth and repay the amount of overpayments of premium (less any amount that has been paid as the cash value of bonuses in excess of the cash value that would have been paid if the contract had been based on the correct date of birth or correct dates of birth) together with interest on that amount at the prescribed rate computed from the date on which the contract was entered into; or

       * (ii) vary the contract by substituting for the sum insured (including any bonuses) the amount in dollars so ascertained.

     * (3) In the application of subsection (2) in relation to a contract that provides for periodic payments, **_the sum insured_** means each such payment (including any bonuses).

     * (3A) If:

      * (a) the expiration date of a contract of life insurance is calculated by reference to the date of birth of a person who is a life insured under the contract; and

      * (b) the person's date of birth was not correctly stated to the insurer at the time when the contract was entered into;

     * then the insurer may (instead of doing any of the things referred to in subsection (2)) vary the contract by changing its expiration date to the date that would have been the expiration date if the contract had been based on the correct date of birth.

     * (4) A variation of a contract under subsection (2) or (3A) has effect from the time when the contract was entered into.

##### 31  Court may disregard avoidance in certain circumstances

     * (1) In any proceedings by the insured in respect of a contract of insurance that has been avoided on the ground of fraudulent failure to comply with the duty of disclosure or fraudulent misrepresentation, the court may, if it would be harsh and unfair not to do so, but subject to this section, disregard the avoidance and, if it does so, shall allow the insured to recover the whole, or such part as the court thinks just and equitable in the circumstances, of the amount that would have been payable if the contract had not been avoided.

     * (2) The power conferred by subsection (1) may be exercised only where the court is of the opinion that, in respect of the loss that is the subject of the proceedings before the court, the insurer has not been prejudiced by the failure or misrepresentation or, if the insurer has been so prejudiced, the prejudice is minimal or insignificant.

     * (3) In exercising the power conferred by subsection (1), the court:

      * (a) shall have regard to the need to deter fraudulent conduct in relation to insurance; and

      * (b) shall weigh the extent of the culpability of the insured in the fraudulent conduct against the magnitude of the loss that would be suffered by the insured if the avoidance were not disregarded;

     * but may also have regard to any other relevant matter.

     * (4) The power conferred by subsection (1) applies only in relation to the loss that is the subject of the proceedings before the court, and any disregard by the court of the avoidance does not otherwise operate to reinstate the contract.

##### 32  Nondisclosure or misrepresentation by life insured covered under group life contract

     * (1) This Division extends to the case where there was a failure to comply with the duty of disclosure, or a misrepresentation was made to the insurer, in respect of a proposed life insured under a group life contract, as if:

      * (a) the insurance cover provided by the group life contract in respect of the life insured were provided by an individual contract of life insurance between the insurer and the insured; and

      * (b) the group life contract had been entered into at the time when the proposed life insured became a life insured under the group life contract.

     * (2) For the purposes of this Division, if the failure to comply with the duty of disclosure, or the misrepresentation, occurred after the proposed life insured became a member of the relevant superannuation, retirement or other group life scheme but before the insurance cover was provided by the group life contract in respect of the life insured, then the failure or misrepresentation is taken to have occurred before the proposed life insured became a life insured under the group life contract.

##### 32A  Nondisclosure or misrepresentation by holder of RSA

     * This Division extends to the case where there was a failure to comply with the duty of disclosure, or a misrepresentation was made to the insurer, in relation to a holder, or a person applying to become a holder, of an RSA as though:

      * (a) the insurance cover provided in relation to that RSA in respect of that person were provided by a contract between the insurer as insurer and the RSA provider as the insured; and

      * (b) that contract has been entered into at the time when the holder became the holder, or the person applying to become the holder, became the holder.

##### 33  No other remedies

     * The provisions of this Division are exclusive of any right that the insurer has otherwise than under this Act in respect of a failure by the insured to disclose a matter to the insurer before the contract was entered into and in respect of a misrepresentation or incorrect statement.

      * (b) the event the happening of which gave rise to the claim is a prescribed event in relation to the contract;

     * the insurer may not refuse to pay an amount equal to the minimum amount in relation to the claim by reason only that the effect of the contract, but for this subsection, would be that the event the happening of which gave rise to the claim was an event in respect of which:

      * (c) the amount of the insurance cover provided by the contract was less than the minimum amount; or

      * (d) insurance cover was not provided by the contract.

     * (2) Subsection (1) does not have effect where the insurer proves that, before the contract was entered into, the insurer clearly informed the insured in writing (whether by providing the insured with a document containing the provisions, or the relevant provisions, of the proposed contract or otherwise) or the insured knew, or a reasonable person in the circumstances could be expected to have known:

      * (a) where the effect of the contract, but for subsection (1), would be that the liability of the insurer in respect of a claim arising upon the happening of the event would be less than the minimum amount--what the extent of the insurer's liability under the contract in respect of such a claim would be; or

      * (b) where the effect of the contract, but for subsection (1), would be that the insurer would be under no liability in respect of such a claim--that the contract would not provide insurance cover in respect of the happening of that event.

     * (3) Regulations made for the purposes of this section take effect at the expiration of 60 days after the day on which they are notified in the _Gazette._

     * _	(4)	Where regulations made for the purposes of this section are amended after the day on which a particular contract of insurance is entered into, the amendments shall be disregarded in relation to the application of subsection (1) to that contract.

#### Division 1A--Definition of flood

##### 37A  Application of this Division

     * (1) This Division applies in relation to a contract of insurance (in this Division called a **_prescribed contract_**) if:

      * (a) the contract is included in a class of contracts of insurance declared by the regulations to be a class of contracts in relation to which this Division applies; and

      * (b) the contract was entered into after the day on which those regulations were made.

     * (2) However, this Division does not apply in relation to a prescribed contract at any time before the transition time for the prescribed contract.

     * (3) Also, this Division does not affect the operation of a prescribed contract in relation to an event that occurred before the transition time for the prescribed contract.

     * (4) In this section:

     * **_transition time_**, for a prescribed contract, means the time when regulations made for the purposes of paragraph (1)(a), declaring a class of contracts of insurance including the contract to be a class of contracts in relation to which this Division applies, commence.

##### 37B  Meaning of flood in prescribed contracts etc.

     * (2) In a prescribed contract (or a notice or other document or information given by the insurer in relation to a prescribed contract):

      * (a) the word **_flood_** has the meaning given by the regulations; and

      * (b) other parts of speech or grammatical forms of that word have corresponding meanings.

     * (3) Subsection (2) has effect in relation to a prescribed contract (or a notice or other document or information given by the insurer in relation to a prescribed contract) even if the meaning of the word **_flood_** (or other parts of speech or grammatical forms of that word) provided by the contract (or the notice or other document or information) is different from the meaning of **_flood_** given by the regulations.

##### 37C  Insurer must clearly inform insured whether prescribed contract provides insurance cover in respect of flood

     * Before entering into a prescribed contract, the insurer must clearly inform the insured in writing whether the contract provides insurance cover in respect of loss or damage caused by, or resulting from, flood as defined by the regulations.

##### 37D  Circumstances in which prescribed contract is taken to provide insurance cover etc. in respect of flood

     * (1) This section applies in relation to a prescribed contract that includes provisions (**_flood provisions_**) that provide insurance cover in respect of loss or damage caused by, or resulting from, one or more flood events (whether or not the contract expressly provides insurance cover for flood as defined by the regulations).

     * (3) The insurer under the prescribed contract may not refuse to pay a claim in respect of loss or damage caused by, or resulting from, the happening of a flood event by reason only that, but for subsection (2), insurance cover in respect of loss or damage caused by, or resulting from, that event was not provided by the contract.

     * (4) If the prescribed contract includes provisions (also **_flood provisions_**) that provide different maximum amounts of insurance cover in respect of different flood events, those provisions are taken to provide a maximum amount of insurance cover in respect of loss or damage caused by, or resulting from, flood, as defined by the regulations, equal to the highest maximum amount (the **_maximum flood cover amount_**) of insurance cover provided by those provisions in respect of any flood event.

     * (5) The insurer under the prescribed contract may not refuse to pay an amount equal to the maximum flood cover amount in relation to a claim in respect of loss or damage caused by, or resulting from, the happening of a flood event by reason only that, but for subsection (4), the maximum amount of insurance cover provided by the contract in respect of loss or damage caused by, or resulting from, that event was less than the maximum flood cover amount.

     * (5A) To avoid doubt, this section does not affect the operation of any provisions of a prescribed contract that are not flood provisions.

     * Where a provision included in an instalment contract of general insurance has the effect of limiting the liability of the insurer by reference to nonpayment of an instalment of the premium, the insurer may not refuse to pay a claim, in whole or in part, by reason only of the operation of that provision unless:

      * (a) at least one instalment of the premium has remained unpaid for a period of at least 14 days; and

      * (b) before the contract was entered into, the insurer clearly informed the insured, in writing, of the effect of the provision.

##### 22  Insurer to inform of duty of disclosure

     * (1) The insurer must, before a contract of insurance is entered into, clearly inform the insured in writing:

      * (a) of the general nature and effect of the duty of disclosure; and

      * (b) if section 21A or 21B applies to the contract--of the general nature and effect of that section; and

      * (c) if the contract is a contract of life insurance--of the effect of section 31A; and

      * (d) that the duty of disclosure applies until the proposed contract is entered into.

     * (2) If the proposed contract is a contract of life insurance, the insurer must also, before the contract is entered into, clearly inform, in writing, any person (other than the insured) who, under the contract, would become a life insured of the matters referred to in subsection (1).

     * (3) If:

      * (a) an insurer complies with subsection (1) in relation to a proposed contract of insurance; and

      * (b) the insurer accepts an offer by the insured to enter into the proposed contract, or makes a counteroffer to enter into another contract of insurance with the insured; and

      * (c) the insurer's acceptance or counteroffer is made more than 2 months after the insured's most recent disclosure for the purpose of complying with the duty of disclosure in relation to the proposed contract;

     * then the insurer must give to the insured, with the acceptance or counteroffer, a reminder notice stating that the duty of disclosure applies until the proposed or other contract is entered into.

     * (4) If the regulations prescribe a form of writing to be used:

      * (a) for informing a person of the matters referred to in subsection (1); or

      * (b) for the reminder notice referred to in subsection (3);

     * the writing to be used may be in accordance with the prescribed form.

     * (5) An insurer who has not complied with subsection (1) and (if applicable) subsection (2) may not exercise a right in respect of a failure to comply with the duty of disclosure, unless the failure was fraudulent.

     * (6) If:

      * (a) an insurer is required to comply with subsection (3) in relation to a contract of insurance; and

      * (b) the insurer does not do so;

     * then the insurer may not exercise a right in respect of a failure to comply with the duty of disclosure in relation to a new matter relating to the contract, unless the failure was fraudulent.

     * (7) For the purposes of subsection (6), a **_new matter_** relating to a contract of insurance is a matter of which the insured first becomes aware after the insured's most recent disclosure for the purpose of complying with the duty of disclosure in relation to the contract.

##### 14  After section 31

   * Insert: 

##### 31A  Nondisclosure by life insured

     * (1) This section applies in relation to a contract of life insurance under which a person (other than the insured) would become a life insured.

     * (2) If, during the negotiations for the contract but before it was entered into, the person (the **_life insured_**) failed to disclose to the insurer a matter that was known to the life insured, being a matter that:

      * (a) the life insured knew to be a matter relevant to the decision of the insurer whether to accept the risk and, if so, on what terms; or

      * (b) a reasonable person in the circumstances could have been expected to know to be a matter so relevant, having regard to factors including, but not limited to:

       * (i) the nature and extent of the insurance cover to be provided under the relevant contract of insurance; and

       * (ii) the class of persons who would ordinarily be expected to apply for insurance cover of that kind;

     * this Act has effect as if the failure to disclose the matter had been a failure by the insured to comply with the duty of disclosure in relation to the matter.

     * (3) Subsection (2) does not apply in relation to a failure by the life insured to disclose a matter:

      * (a) that diminishes the risk; or

      * (b) that is of common knowledge; or

      * (c) that the insurer knows or in the ordinary course of the insurer's business as an insurer ought to know; or

      * (d) as to which compliance with the duty of disclosure is waived by the insurer.
