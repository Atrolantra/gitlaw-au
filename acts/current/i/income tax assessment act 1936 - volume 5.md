##### Guide to Division 57

##### 571  What this Division is about

    * This Division is about the income tax treatment of a taxpayer whose income ceases to be wholly exempt. Broadly, income, outgoings, gains and losses are attributed to the periods before and after the loss of full exemption.

##### Subdivision 57A--Key concepts

##### 575  Entities to which this Division applies

    * If: 

     * (a) at a particular time, all of the income of a taxpayer is wholly exempt from income tax; and

     * (b) immediately after that time, the taxpayer's income becomes to any extent assessable income;

    * then: 

     * (c) the taxpayer is a **_transition taxpayer_**; and

     * (d) the time when the taxpayer's income becomes to that extent assessable is the **_transition time_**; and

     * (e) the year of income in which the transition time occurs is the **_transition year_** for the taxpayer.

##### Subdivision 57B--Predecessors of the transition taxpayer

##### 5710  Activities of transition taxpayer's predecessor attributed to transition taxpayer

    * (1) If:

     * (a) at the transition time, the transition taxpayer performs particular functions or carries on particular activities; and

     * (b) during any period before the transition taxpayer first began to perform the functions or carry on the activities, an exempt government entity performed those same functions or carried on those same activities; and

     * (c) at the end of the period, responsibility for performing the functions or carrying on the activities was transferred, either directly or through one or more other exempt government entities, to the transition taxpayer;

    * this Division applies as if, during that period, anything done by or to the exempt government entity in performing those functions or carrying on those activities had instead been done by or to the transition taxpayer.

         * Note: As a result of this provision, the transition taxpayer may for example be able to deduct after the transition time, under Division 40 of the _Income Tax Assessment Act 1997 _as modified by Subdivision 57J of this Schedule, a portion of allowable capital expenditure incurred before the transition time by an exempt government entity whose functions were transferred to the transition taxpayer.

    * (2) An **_exempt government entity_** is:

     * (a) the Commonwealth, a State or a Territory; or

     * (b) an STB, within the meaning of Division 1AB of Part III, that is exempt from tax under that Division.

##### Subdivision 57C--Time when income derived

##### 5715  Time when income derived

     * (a) services rendered; or

     * (b) goods provided; or

     * (c) the doing of any other thing;

    * at or after the transition time, the income is treated for the purposes of this Act as having been derived at the time the services were rendered, the goods were provided or the thing was done, as the case requires.

    * (2) To the extent that income derived by the transition taxpayer at or after the transition time is in respect of:

     * (a) services rendered; or

     * (b) goods provided; or

     * (c) the doing of any other thing;

    * before the transition time, the income is treated for the purposes of this Act as having been derived before that time.

##### Subdivision 57D--Time when losses and outgoings incurred

##### 5720  Time when losses and outgoings incurred

    * (1) To the extent that a loss or outgoing (within the meaning of section 51 of this Act or section 81 of the _Income Tax Assessment Act 1997_, as appropriate) incurred by the transition taxpayer before the transition time is in respect of:

     * (a) services rendered; or

     * (b) goods provided; or

     * (c) the doing of any other thing;

    * at or after the transition time, the loss or outgoing is treated for the purposes of this Act as having been incurred at the time the services were rendered, the goods were provided or the thing was done, as the case requires.

    * (2) To the extent that a loss or outgoing (within the meaning of section 51 of this Act or section 81 of the _Income Tax Assessment Act 1997_, as appropriate) incurred by the transition taxpayer at or after the transition time is in respect of:

     * (a) services rendered; or

     * (b) goods provided; or

    * where the transition taxpayer owned the asset at all times from the transition time until the disposal or the CGT event.

    * Deemed disposal and repurchase

    * (2) Subject to subsection (5), in determining for the purposes of this Act (other than the excluded provisions mentioned in subsection (4)) whether an amount is included in, or allowable as a deduction from, the assessable income of the transition taxpayer in respect of the disposal, the transition taxpayer is taken:

     * (a) to have sold, immediately before the transition time, each of its assets; and

     * (b) to have purchased each of its assets again at the transition time for consideration equal to the asset's adjusted market value at the transition time.

    * (2A) For the purposes of Parts 31 and 33 of the _Income Tax Assessment Act 1997_ (about CGT), in determining whether the transition taxpayer makes a capital gain or capital loss from a CGT event that happens after the transition time in relation to an asset referred to in subsection (1), the cost base and reduced cost base of the asset (at the transition time) is its adjusted market value at that time.

    * (3) An asset's**_ adjusted market value_** at the transition time is the asset's market value at that time:

     * (a) reduced by any amount of income received or receivable by the transition taxpayer in respect of the asset at or after the transition time that:

       * (i) because of subsection 5715(2); or

       * (ii) because all of the income of the transition taxpayer was wholly exempt from income tax before the transition time;

     * is not included in the transition taxpayer's assessable income; and

     * (b) increased by any amount of income received or receivable by the transition taxpayer in respect of the asset before the transition time that:

       * (i) because of subsection 5715(1); or

       * (ii) because the transition taxpayer's income ceased to be exempt from income tax at the transition time;

     * is included in the transition taxpayer's assessable income.

    * Excluded provisions

    * (4) For the purposes of subsection (2), the **_excluded provisions_** are:

     * (e) former Division 10B of Part III of this Act (about industrial property); and

     * (f) former Division 10BA of Part III of this Act (about Australian films); and

     * (ga) Division 40 of the _Income Tax Assessment Act 1997_ (about capital allowances); and

     * (la) Division 373 of the _Income Tax Assessment Act 1997_ (about intellectual property).

    * Listed provisions not affected

    * (5) If the transition taxpayer:

     * (a) acquired an asset (whether before the transition time or otherwise) before the commencement of a provision listed in subsection (6); and

     * (b) after acquiring the asset, owned the asset at all times before the transition time;

    * the deemed acquisition of the asset under subsection (2) does not affect the operation of the listed provision.

    * Listed provisions

    * (6) The provisions are listed in the table below. Provisions of the _Income Tax Assessment Act 1997 _are identified in normal text. The other provisions, **in bold**, are provisions of the _Income Tax Assessment Act 1936_.

    * Avoidance of doubt--debt writeoff

    * (7) To avoid doubt, an effect of subsection (2) is that the sum of all allowable deductions (if any) in respect of the writing off as bad of the whole or part of a debt to which that subsection applies will not exceed the market value of the debt at the transition time.

    * Avoidance of doubt--disposal need not involve an alienation

    * (8) To avoid doubt, an asset may be **_disposed of_** for the purposes of this section whether or not the disposal involves alienating the asset.

    * (1) Subject to subsection (3), for the purposes of determining a deduction allowable to, or an amount included in the assessable income of, the transition taxpayer after the transition time in respect of the satisfaction of a liability owed by the transition taxpayer immediately before the transition time, the transition taxpayer is taken:

     * (a) to have ceased immediately before the transition time to have any liabilities; and

     * (b) to have assumed each of its liabilities again at the transition time in return for consideration equal to the adjusted market value (see subsection (2)) at that time of the right or other asset, corresponding to the liability, that was held by the person to whom the liability was owed.

    * (2) The **_adjusted market value_** of the corresponding right or other asset is the market value of that right or asset at the transition time:

     * (a) reduced by any amount paid or that becomes payable by the transition taxpayer in respect of the liability at or after the transition time, where:

       * (i) because of subsection 5720(2); or

       * (ii) because all of the transition taxpayer's income was wholly exempt from income tax before the transition time;

     * the amount is not an allowable deduction; and

     * (b) increased by any amount paid or that became payable by the transition taxpayer in respect of the liability before the transition time, where:

       * (i) because of subsection 5720(1); or

       * (ii) because the transition taxpayer's income ceased to be exempt from income tax at the transition time;

     * the amount is an allowable deduction.

    * (3) A provision listed in subsection (4) only applies to a liability of the transition taxpayer at the transition time if the liability first came into existence after the day on which Division 3B of Part III commenced.

    * (4) The provisions are listed in the table below. Provisions of the _Income Tax Assessment Act 1997 _are identified in normal text. The other provisions, **in bold**, are provisions of the _Income Tax Assessment Act 1936_.

         * Note: For **_applicable commencement date_**, see section 775155 of the _Income Tax Assessment Act 1997_.

    * (6) The provisions are listed in the table below. Provisions of the _Income Tax Assessment Act 1997 _are identified in normal text.

     * (b) any chose in action; and

     * (c) any right, interest or claim of any kind including rights, interests or claims in or in relation to property (whether arising under an instrument or otherwise, and whether liquidated or unliquidated, certain or contingent, accrued or accruing); and

    * but does not include trading stock.

    * **_liability_** includes a duty or obligation of any kind (whether arising under an instrument or otherwise, and whether actual, contingent or prospective).

##### Subdivision 57F--Superannuation deductions

##### 5740  Contributions under defined benefit superannuation schemes

    * (1) This section applies to a deduction allowable apart from this Subdivision to the transition taxpayer under section 29060 of the _Income Tax Assessment Act 1997_ for a contribution made to a fund in relation to a person if:

     * (a) the person was an employee of the transition taxpayer at any time before or after the transition time; and

     * (b) the contribution was made under a defined benefit superannuation scheme (within the meaning of section 6A of the _Superannuation Guarantee (Administration) Act 1992_).

    * Deduction allowable only if sum of all deductions exceeds defined benefit threshold amount

    * (2) The deduction is not allowable for a year of income if the sum of all deductions of the transition taxpayer to which this section applies for the year of income is less than or equal to the defined benefit threshold amount (see subsection (4)) for the year of income.

    * Amount of deduction not allowable

    * (3) If the sum is greater than that amount, so much of the deduction as is worked out using the following formula is not allowable:

    * Meaning of** defined benefit threshold amount**

    * **	(4)	The **_defined benefit threshold amount_** for a year of income is:

     * (a) if the year of income is the transition year--the unfunded liability amount (see subsection (5)); or

     * (b) in any other case--that amount as reduced by the total amount of deductions to which this section applies, that, because of subsection (2) or (3), have not (disregarding section 5755) been allowable to the transition taxpayer for all previous years of income.

    * Meaning of** unfunded liability amount**

    * **	(5)	The **_unfunded liability amount _**is the value, worked out as at the transition time in accordance with actuarial principles, of the liabilities of the transition taxpayer to provide superannuation benefits for, or for dependants of, employees of the transition taxpayer, where the liabilities:

     * (a) had accrued as at the transition time; and

     * (b) were, according to actuarial principles, unfunded at that time; and

     * (c) were liabilities only under defined benefit superannuation schemes.

##### 5745  Deduction for surplus to meet defined benefit superannuation scheme liabilities

    * If: 

     * (a) at the transition time, according to a particular defined benefit superannuation scheme's accounts, an amount is available to meet liabilities of the transition taxpayer under the scheme to provide superannuation benefits for, or for dependants of, employees of the transition taxpayer; and

     * (b) the amount exceeds the total value (as worked out according to actuarial principles) of the liabilities of that kind that have accrued as at the transition time; and

     * (c) before the transition time, the transition taxpayer makes a written election that the excess is to be used solely to meet liabilities of that kind accruing after the transition time, and the excess is later used solely to meet such liabilities;

    * the excess is an allowable deduction of the transition taxpayer for the transition year.

##### 5750  Contributions generally

    * (1) This section applies to a deduction allowable apart from this Subdivision to the transition taxpayer under section 29060 of the _Income Tax Assessment Act 1997_ for a contribution made to a fund in relation to a person if the person was an employee of the transition taxpayer at any time before or after the transition time.

    * Deduction allowable only if sum of all deductions exceeds general superannuation threshold amount

    * (2) The deduction is not allowable for a year of income if the sum of all deductions of the transition taxpayer to which this section applies for the year of income is less than or equal to the general superannuation threshold amount (see subsection (4)) for the year of income.

    * Amount of deduction not allowable

    * (3) If the sum is greater than the general superannuation threshold amount, so much of the deduction as is worked out using the following formula is not allowable:

    * Meaning of** general superannuation threshold amount**

    * **	(4)	The **_general superannuation threshold amount_** for a year of income is:

     * (a) if the year of income is the transition year--the undischarged superannuation liability amount (see subsection (5)); or

     * (b) in any other case--the amount applicable under paragraph (a), reduced by the total amount of deductions to which this section applies that, because of subsection (2) or (3), have not (disregarding section 5755) been allowable to the transition taxpayer for all previous years of income.

    * Meaning of undischarged superannuation liability amount

    * (5) This is how to work out the transition taxpayer's **_undischarged superannuation liability amount_**:

       * Step 1.	For each person who was an employee of the transition taxpayer at any time before the transition time, take the sum of:

         * (a) if the whole or any part of the person's period of employment with the transition taxpayer took place before the beginning of the superannuation guarantee period (see subsection (6)) and there were one or more required award etc. contribution amounts (see subsection (7)) in respect of any of that whole or part--that amount or those amounts; and

         * (b) if, for the whole or any part or parts of the superannuation guarantee period, there were one or more required award etc. contribution amounts that were greater than the required superannuation guarantee contribution amount or amounts (see subsection (8))--that greater amount or those greater amounts; and

         * (c) if, for the whole or any part or parts of the superannuation guarantee period, either there was no required award etc. contribution amount or there was such an amount but it was not greater than the required superannuation guarantee contribution amount--the required superannuation guarantee contribution amount for the whole or the part of the period, or the sum of the required superannuation guarantee contribution amounts for the parts of the period, as the case may be.

       * Step 2.	Reduce the sum from Step 1 by the sum of amounts that the transition taxpayer actually contributed before the start of the transition year:

         * (a) in payment of required award etc. contribution amounts or required superannuation guarantee contribution amounts for the employee that are included in the sum in Step 1; or

         * (b) voluntarily to a superannuation fund for the purpose of providing superannuation benefits for the employee, or dependants of the employee;

       * in respect of any period of employment of the employee with the transition taxpayer before the transition time.

       * Step 3.	If the result after applying Step 2 for a particular employee is less than nil, it is nil instead.

       * Step 4.	Add up the results for all of the employees. This final sum is the transition taxpayer's **_undischarged superannuation liability amount_**.

    * Meaning of** superannuation guarantee period**

    * **	(6)	The **_superannuation guarantee period_** is the period beginning on 1 July 1992 and ending at the transition time.

    * Meaning of** required award etc. contribution amount**

    * **	(7)	A **_required award etc. contribution amount_** is an amount required to be contributed to a superannuation fund by an employer for the benefit of an employee:

     * (a) by an industrial award; or

     * (b) by an occupational superannuation arrangement; or

     * (c) by a law of the Commonwealth, a State or a Territory; or

     * (d) otherwise.

    * Meaning of** required superannuation guarantee contribution amount**

    * **	(8)	A **_required superannuation guarantee contribution amount_** is an amount that an employer would need to contribute in respect of a period so as not to have a superannuation guarantee shortfall under the _Superannuation Guarantee (Administration) Act 1992 _in respect of that period.

         * Note: The relevant periods for which shortfalls are or were calculated under that Act are quarters (from 1 July 1993 onwards) or halfyears (from 1 July 1992 to 30 June 1993).

##### 5752  Section 5750 does not apply if there is a surplus at transition time

    * Section 5750 does not apply to a deduction of the kind mentioned in subsection 5750(1) if:

     * (a) at the transition time, according to the accounts of the fund concerned, an amount is available to meet liabilities of the transition taxpayer in relation to the fund to provide superannuation benefits for, or for dependants of, employees of the transition taxpayer; and

     * (b) the amount exceeds the value (as worked out according to actuarial principles) of the liabilities of that kind that have accrued as at the transition time.

##### 5755  Deductions reduced under both sections 5740 and 5750

    * If the amount of a deduction otherwise allowable to the transition taxpayer in respect of a contribution to a fund is required to be reduced under both sections 5740 and 5750: 

     * (a) if the reduction is of a different amount--the amount is reduced only under that section that requires the greater reduction; or

     * (b) if the reduction is of the same amount--the amount is reduced only under section 5740.

##### Subdivision 57G--Denial of certain deductions

##### 5760  Effect of pretransition time accrued leave entitlements

     * (a) if the year of income is the transition year--the (pretransition time service) leave amount (see subsection (5)) of the transition taxpayer; or

     * (b) in any other case--that amount as reduced by the total amount of deductions to which this section applies that, because of subsection (2) or (3), have not been allowable to the transition taxpayer for all previous years of income.

    * (3) If the sum is greater than that limit, so much of the deduction as is worked out using the following formula is not allowable:

    * Meaning of **doubtful debt provision limit**

    * **	(4)	The **_doubtful debt provision limit_** for a year of income is:

     * (a) if the year of income is the transition year--the pretransition doubtful debt limit (see subsection (5)); or

    * (3) The table is as follows:

##### 5790  Posttransition deductions--assume that the transition taxpayer had never been exempt

    * In working out the transition taxpayer's allowable deductions under a modified deduction rule for the transition year or a later year of income, assume that the modified deduction rule had applied at all times before the transition time as if the transition taxpayer's income had never been exempt from income tax.

     * (a) assume that the transition taxpayer did not, at any time, make any election or declaration, or give any notice, under the rule in relation to a year of income before the transition year; and

     * (b) any election or declaration (other than one under former subsection 124ZADA(1)) the transition taxpayer makes, or any notice the transition taxpayer gives, under the rule in relation to the transition year has no effect in so far as it relates to expenditure incurred before the transition time.

##### 57105  Special rules for mining and quarrying

    * (1) In working out the transition taxpayer's allowable deductions under the former Subdivision 330A or 330C or Division 40 of the _Income Tax Assessment Act 1997_, assume that the transition taxpayer incurred no expenditure on exploration and prospecting before the transition time.

    * Assume that no excess deductions available

    * (2) In working out the transition taxpayer's allowable deductions under the former Subdivision 330A or 330C of the _Income Tax Assessment Act 1997_, assume that, for each year of income before the transition year, the transition taxpayer's assessable income would have exceeded the total of the transition taxpayer's deductions for the year.

         * Note: This means that the transition taxpayer can have no excess deductions remaining from years of income before the transition year.

##### Subdivision 57K--Balancing adjustments

##### 57110  Apportionment of balancing adjustments

    * (1) If, apart from this subsection, a balancing adjustment provision (see subsection (2)) would:

     * (b) allow an amount as a deduction from the transition taxpayer's assessable income for the transition year or a later year of income in respect of particular expenditure;

    * then only so much of the amount as is worked out using the following formula is so included or allowable: 

    * where: 

    * **_actual deductions_** is the sum of all deductions actually allowed or allowable to the transition taxpayer for the expenditure under the deduction rule to which the balancing adjustment provision relates (see subsection (2)).

    * **_notional deductions_** is the sum of all deductions for the expenditure that would have been allowable to the transition taxpayer under the deduction rule to which the balancing adjustment provision relates, if the transition taxpayer had never been wholly exempt from income tax.

    * (2) Each **_balancing adjustment provision_** and its related **_deduction rule_** are shown in an item of the table. Provisions of the _Income Tax Assessment Act 1997_ are shown in ordinary text, and provisions of the _Income Tax Assessment Act 1936_ are shown **in bold**.

##### Subdivision 57L--Trading stock

##### 57115  Modification of trading stock provisions

    * (1) For the purposes of applying Division 70 of the _Income Tax Assessment Act 1997_ in relation to the transition year, the only trading stock of the transition taxpayer that is to be taken into account under section 7035 of that Act as being on hand at the beginning of the transition year is such trading stock as was on hand at the transition time.

    * (2) For the purpose of working out the value at which the trading stock is to be taken into account, the year of income preceding the transition year is taken to have ended immediately before the transition time.

         * Note: The value of trading stock on hand at the beginning of the transition year will, under section 7040 of the _Income Tax Assessment Act 1997_, be the same as at the end of the preceding year of income.

    * (3) If:

     * (a) the basis of valuation of the trading stock at the end of the transition year is cost; and

     * (b) the basis of valuation at the beginning of the transition year is different;

    * then, for the purposes of the valuation at the end of the transition year, the cost of the trading stock for the purposes of Division 70 of the _Income Tax Assessment Act 1997_ is taken to be equal to the value at which it was taken into account at the beginning of the transition year.

## Schedule 2F--Trust losses and other deductions

#### Division 265--Overview of Schedule

##### 2655  What this Schedule is about

    * If there is a change in ownership or control of a trust or an abnormal trading in its units, it:

       * (ii) nonfixed trusts (other than family trusts) must have held fixed entitlements to a 50% or greater share of the income or a 50% or greater share of the capital of the holding entity.

    * Second condition

    * (3) The persons holding fixed entitlements to shares of the income, and the persons holding fixed entitlements to shares of the capital, of:

     * (a) in a paragraph (2)(a) case--the trust; or

     * (b) in a paragraph (2)(b) case--the holding entity;

    * at the beginning of the test period must have held those entitlements to those shares at all times during the test period.

    * Third condition

    * (4) At the beginning of the test period:

     * (a) individuals must not have had more than a 50% stake in the income of the trust; or

     * (b) individuals must not have had more than a 50% stake in the capital of the trust.

    * Fourth condition

     * (a) if this section is being applied for the purposes of section 26625--section 26720 would not have prevented the nonfixed trust from deducting the tax loss concerned if it, rather than the fixed trust, had incurred the loss; or

     * (b) if this section is being applied for the purposes of section 26630--section 26760 does not require the nonfixed trust to work out its net income and tax loss for the income year under Division 268; or

     * (c) if this section is being applied for the purposes of section 26635--section 26725, or section 26765, as the case requires, would not have prevented the nonfixed trust from deducting the amount concerned if it, rather than the fixed trust, would otherwise be entitled to deduct the amount.

##### 26650  Deducting part of a tax loss

    * (1) If section 26625 prevents the fixed trust from deducting a tax loss, it can deduct the part of the tax loss that is attributable to a part of the loss year.

    * (2) However, the trust can do this only if, assuming that that part of the loss year had been treated as the whole of the loss year for the purposes of sections 26640 and 26645, the trust would have been entitled to deduct the tax loss.

##### 26655  Information about nonfixed trusts with interests in fixed trust

    * Notice about nonresident nonfixed trust

    * (1) The Commissioner may give the trustee of a fixed trust a notice in accordance with section 26660 if the requirements of subsections (2) to (5) of this section are met.

    * First requirement

    * (2) In its return of income for an income year, the fixed trust:

     * (a) must have deducted a tax loss from an earlier income year; or

     * (b) must not have worked out its net income and tax loss for the income year under Division 268; or

     * (c) must have deducted an amount in relation to a debt;

    * where it would not be allowed to deduct the tax loss or amount in respect of the debt, or would be required to work out its net income and tax loss under that Division, unless it met the conditions in section 26645.

    * Second requirement

    * (3) In order to determine whether it meets the conditions in section 26645, the Commissioner must need information about a nonfixed trust mentioned in subsection 26645(5).

    * Third requirement

    * (4) When the Commissioner gives the notice:

     * (a) a trustee of the nonfixed trust must be a nonresident; or

     * (b) the central management and control of the nonfixed trust must be outside .

    * Fourth requirement

    * (5) The Commissioner must give the notice before the later of:

     * (a) 5 years after the end of the income year mentioned in subsection (2); and

     * (b) the end of the period during which the trustee of the fixed trust is required by section 262A to retain records in relation to that income year.

##### 26660  Notices where requirements of section 26655 are met

    * Information required

    * (1) The notice that the Commissioner may give if the requirements of subsections 26655(2) to (5) are met must require the trustee to give the Commissioner specified information that is relevant to determining whether the requirements of subsection 26645(5) are satisfied in relation to the nonfixed trust mentioned in subsections 26655(3) and (4).

    * Trustee knowledge

    * (2) The information need not be within the knowledge of the trustee at the time the notice is given.

    * Period for giving information

    * (3) The notice must specify a period within which the trustee is to give the information. The period must not end earlier than 21 days after the day on which the Commissioner gives the notice.

    * Consequence of not giving the information

    * (4) If the trustee does not give the information within the period or within such further period as the Commissioner allows, the fixed trust is taken not to meet, and never to have met, the conditions in section 26645.

    * Application of Division 268

    * (5) If, because of subsection (4), the fixed trust is required to work out under Division 268 its net income and tax loss for the income year mentioned in subsection 26655(2), that Division is to be applied as if Subdivision 268B required the income year to be divided into such periods as would result in the highest possible net income for the income year.

    * No offences or penalties

    * (6) To avoid doubt, subsections (4) and (5) do not cause the trustee of the fixed trust to commit any offence or be liable to any penalty under Part 425 in Schedule 1 to the _Taxation Administration Act 1953_ for deducting the amount concerned, or for not working out the trust's net income and tax loss under Division 268, in its return.

    * (5) If, because of subsection (4), the fixed trust is required to work out under Division 268 its net income and tax loss for the income year mentioned in subsection 266180(2), that Division is to be applied as if Subdivision 268B required the income year to be divided into such periods as would result in the highest possible net income for the income year.

    * No offences or penalties

    * (6) To avoid doubt, subsections (4) and (5) do not cause the trustee of the primary trust to commit any offence or be liable to any penalty under Part 425 in Schedule 1 to the _Taxation Administration Act 1953_ for deducting the amount concerned, or for not working out the trust's net income and tax loss under Division 268, in the trust's return.

       * (ii) if the trust met the requirements of paragraph 26645(2)(b)--the holding entity mentioned in that paragraph;

     * and the percentages of the shares that they hold, remaining the same during the whole of the period; and

     * (b) the times that, for all of the nonfixed trusts (other than excepted trusts) holding directly or indirectly a fixed entitlement to a share of the income or capital of the trust at any time during the income year, are the latest times that would result in individuals having more than a 50% stake in their income or capital; and

     * (c) the earliest time in the period when a group begins to control a nonfixed trust (other than an excepted trust) that holds directly or indirectly a fixed entitlement to a share of the income or capital of the trust at any time during the income year.

         *  To find out when a group begins to control a trust: see Subdivision 269E.

##### 26820  Income year of widely held unit trust to be divided into periods

    * (1) If a trust's net income and tax loss for the income year are required by section 26680, 266115 or 266155 to be worked out under this Division, the income year is divided into periods as follows.

    * (3) The last period ends at the end of the income year.

    * (4) If the condition in subsection 26770(2) applies but the trust does not meet the condition, each period (except the last) ends at the earlier of:

     * (a) the latest time, after the test time mentioned in that section, that would result in the same individuals having more than a 50% stake in the income or the capital, as the case requires, of the trust during the whole of the period; or

     * (b) the earliest time when a group begins to control the trust directly or indirectly.

    * (5) If the condition in subsection 26770(2) does not apply, or does apply and the trust meets the condition, each period (except the last) ends at the earliest time when a group begins to control the trust directly or indirectly.

##### Subdivision 268C--Other steps in working out the net income and tax loss

##### 26830  Calculate the notional loss or net income for each period

    * (1) A notional loss or notional net income of the trust must be worked out for each period into which the income year has been divided in accordance with Subdivision 268B.

    * (2) The trust has a notional loss for a period if the deductions attributed to the period under section 26835 exceed the assessable income attributed to the period under section 26840. The **_notional loss_** is the amount of the excess.

         * For a period during which the trust was in partnership, the notional loss is worked out under Subdivision 268D.

    * (3) On the other hand, if that assessable income exceeds those deductions, the trust has a **_notional net income_** for the period, equal to the excess.

         * For a period during which the trust was in partnership, the notional net income is worked out under Subdivision 268D.

    * (4) If the trust has a notional loss for _none_ of the periods in the income year, this Subdivision has no further application, and the trust's net income for the income year is calculated in the usual way.

         * The usual way of working out net income is set out in section 95.

##### 26835  How to attribute deductions to periods

    * (1) The trust's deductions for the income year are attributed to periods in the income year as follows.

    * (2) The following deductions are attributed to each period in proportion to the length of the period:

     * (aa) deductions for the decline in value of a depreciating asset;

         * See Division 40 of the _Income Tax Assessment Act 1997_.

     * (c) deductions for expenditure, deductions for which are spread over 2 or more years, but not full year deductions (see subsection (5));

     * (d) deductions for expenditure of capital monies in connection with an Australian film.

         * See former section 124ZAFA.

    * (3) All other deductions (except full year deductions) are attributed to periods as if each period were an income year.

    * (4) Full year deductions are not attributed to any of the periods. They are brought in at a later stage of the process of calculating the trust's net income for the income year.

    * (5) These are **_full year deductions_**:

     * (a) deductions for bad debts under section 81 (about general deductions) of the _Income Tax Assessment Act 1997_;

     * (b) deductions for bad debts under section 2535 (about bad debts) of the _Income Tax Assessment Act 1997_, or for losses on debt/equity swaps under section 63E;

     * (c) deductions, so far as they are allowable under Division 8 (which is about deductions) of the _Income Tax Assessment Act 1997_, because Subdivision H (Period of deductibility of certain advance expenditure) of Division 3 of Part III applies to the trust in relation to the income year;

     * (d) deductions allowable under Division 30 of the _Income Tax Assessment Act 1997_;

     * (e) deductions for payments of pensions, gratuities or retiring allowances under section 2550 of the _Income Tax Assessment Act 1997_;

     * (f) deductions for tax losses of earlier income years;

         * See Division 36 of the _Income Tax Assessment Act 1997_.

     * (j) deductions for farm management deposits.

          * Note: See Division 393 of the _Income Tax Assessment Act 1997_.

    * (6) However, a deduction for the balance of capital expenditure is _not_ a full year deduction if the deduction results from the disposal, loss, lapse, termination of use or destruction of the property.

         * See Subdivision 40D of the _Income Tax Assessment Act 1997_.

##### 26840  How to attribute assessable income to periods

    * (1) The trust's assessable income for the income year is attributed to periods in the income year as follows.

    * (2) The following amounts are attributed to periods so far as they are reasonably attributable to those periods:

     * (a) amounts included in the trust's assessable income under section 97 (Beneficiary of a trust estate not under a legal disability); or

     * (b) amounts included in the trust's assessable income under section 98A (Nonresident beneficiaries assessable in respect of certain income).

    * (3) The following items of assessable income are attributed to each period in proportion to the length of the period:

     * (a) insurance recoveries for loss of livestock or trees;

         * See section 385130 of the _Income Tax Assessment Act 1997_.

     * (b) amounts included in assessable income as a result of elections relating to the forced disposal of livestock; 

         * See Subdivision 385E and section 385160 of the _Income Tax Assessment Act 1997_.

     * (c) recoupment of mains electricity connection expenditure.

         * See item 1.25 in section 2030, which lists deductions for which recoupments are assessable under Subdivision 20A, of the _Income Tax Assessment Act 1997_.

    * (4) An amount included in the trust's assessable income under section 385185 (Election to defer including profit on second wool clip) of the _Income Tax Assessment Act 1997 _is attributed to the period when the wool would ordinarily have been shorn.

    * (5) An amount included in the trust's assessable income that is a dividend under:

     * (a) section 65 (Payments to associated persons); or

     * (c) section 109 (Excessive payments to shareholders and associates); or 

     * (d) Division 7A of Part III (Distributions to entities connected with a private company);

    * is attributed to the period when the amount was paid or credited, whichever occurred first.

    * (6) All other items of assessable income (except full year amounts) are attributed to periods as if each period were an income year.

    * (7) **_Full year amounts_** are amounts referred to in paragraphs (2)(a) and (b), so far as they are not reasonably attributable to a period. They are brought in at a later stage of the process of calculating the trust's net income for the income year.

##### 26845  How to calculate the trust's net income for the income year

    * (1) The trust's **_net income_** for the income year is worked out as follows.

    * (2) Add up the notional net incomes (if any) worked out under section 26830 or 26870.

         * Note: A notional **_loss_** for a period is _not_ taken into account, but counts towards the trust's tax loss for the income year.

    * (3) Add the full year amounts referred to in subsection 26840(7) (if any).

    * (4) Subtract the trust's fullyear deductions of these kinds:

     * (a) deductions for bad debts under section 81 (about general deductions) of the _Income Tax Assessment Act 1997_;

     * (b) deductions for bad debts under section 2535 (about bad debts) of the _Income Tax Assessment Act 1997_;

     * (c) deductions, so far as they are allowable under Division 8 (which is about deductions) of the _Income Tax Assessment Act 1997_ because Subdivision H (Period of deductibility of certain advance expenditure) of Division 3 of Part III applies to the trust in relation to the income year;

    * unless they exceed the total of the notional net incomes and the full year amounts. (If they equal or exceed that total, the trust does not have a net income for the income year.)

    * (5) If an amount remains, subtract from it the trust's other full year deductions, in the order shown in subsection 26835(5), unless they exceed the amount remaining. (If they equal or exceed that amount, the trust does not have a net income for the income year.)

    * (6) The amount (if any) remaining is the trust's **_net income_** for the income year.

##### 26860  How to work out the trust's section 3610 tax loss for the income year

    * (1) For the purposes of Division 36 (Tax losses of earlier income years) of the _Income Tax Assessment Act 1997_, instead of working out the trust's tax loss for the year under section 3610 of that Act, it is worked out as follows.

    * (2) Total the notional losses.

    * (3) Add the amount (if any) by which the trust's full year deductions of these kinds:

     * (a) deductions for bad debts under section 81 (about general deductions) of the _Income Tax Assessment Act 1997_;

     * (b) deductions for bad debts under section 2535 ( about bad debts) of the _Income Tax Assessment Act 1997_;

     * (c) deductions, so far as they are allowable under Division 8 (which is about deductions) of the _Income Tax Assessment Act 1997 _because Subdivision H (Period of deductibility of certain advance expenditure) of Division 3 of Part III applies to the trust in relation to the income year;

    * exceed the total of: 

     * (d) the notional net incomes (if any); and

         *  To work out the notional net income: see sections 26830 and 26870.

     * (e) the full year amounts referred to in section 26840 (if any).

    * (4) If the trust derived exempt income, subtract its net exempt income as defined in section 3620 of the _Income Tax Assessment Act 1997_.

    * (5) Any amount remaining is the trust's tax loss for the income year.

         * To find out _how much_ of the tax loss can be deducted in later income years, see Division 266 or 267.

         * To find out _how_ to deduct it, see section 3615 or 3617 of the _Income Tax Assessment Act 1997_.

##### Subdivision 268D--Rules that supplement Subdivision 268C if the trust is in partnership 

##### 26870  How to calculate the trust's notional loss or net income for a period when the trust was a partner

    * (1) This section applies if at any time during a period the trust was a partner in one or more partnerships.

    * (2) The trust has a notional loss for the period if the total (the **_loss total_**) of:

     * (a) the deductions attributed to the period under section 26835; and

     * (b) the trust's share of each notional loss (if any) of a partnership for the period;

    * exceeds the total (the **_income total_**) of:

     * (c) the assessable income attributed to the period under section 26840; and

     * (d) the trust's share of each notional net income (if any) of a partnership for the period.

    * The**_ notional loss_** is the amount of the excess.

         * Note: A notional loss is taken into account in working out the trust's tax loss under section 26860.

    * (3) On the other hand, if the income total exceeds the loss total, the trust has a **_notional net income_** for the period, equal to the excess.

         * Note: A notional net income is taken into account in working out the trust's net income under section 26845.

    * (4) If the trust has a notional net income for _all_ periods in the income year, this Subdivision has no further application, and the trust's net income for the income year is worked out in the usual way.

         * The usual way of working out net income is set out in section 95.

##### 26875  How to calculate the trust's share of a partnership's notional loss or notional net income for a period if both entities have the same income year

    * (1) This section applies if at any time during a period the trust is a partner in a partnership that has an income year that begins and ends when the trust's income year begins and ends.

    * (2) The partnership's notional loss or notional net income for the period is worked out in the same way as the notional loss or notional net income of a trust.

    * (3) The trust's share is calculated by dividing:

     * (a) the trust's interest in the partnership's net income or partnership loss of the income year;

    * by: 

     * (b) the amount of that net income or partnership loss;

    * and expressing the result as a percentage.

    * (4) However, if the partnership had neither a net income nor a partnership loss, the trust's share is a percentage that is fair and reasonable having regard to the extent of the trust's interest in the partnership.

##### 26880  How to calculate the trust's share of a partnership's notional loss or notional net income for a period if the entities have different income years

    * (1) This section applies if at any time during a period the trust is a partner in a partnership that has an income year that begins and ends at a different time from when the trust's income year begins and ends.

    * (2) So much of the partnership's net income or partnership loss of an income year as was derived during the period is a notional net income or notional loss of the partnership for the period. (For the purposes of this subsection, the partnership's net income or partnership loss is calculated without taking account of the partnership's full year deductions for that income year.)

         * Note: The partnership's full year deductions are dealt with in section 26885.

    * (3) The trust's share is calculated by dividing:

     * (a) the trust's interest in the partnership's net income or partnership loss of the income year;

    * by: 

     * (b) the amount of that net income or partnership loss;

    * and expressing the result as a percentage.

##### 26885  Trust's full year deductions include a share of partnership's full year deductions

    * (1) This section applies if at any time during the income year the trust is a partner in a partnership that has one or more full year deductions for the income year of the partnership that corresponds to the income year of the trust.

    * (2) The partnership's full year deductions are treated as full year deductions of the trust, but only to the extent of the trust's share. 

    * (3) If the partnership's income year is the same as the trust's, the trust's share is calculated by dividing:

     * (a) the trust's interest in the partnership's net income or partnership loss of the income year;

    * by: 

     * (b) the amount of that net income or partnership loss;

    * and expressing the result as a percentage.

    * (4) However, if the partnership had neither a net income nor a partnership loss, the trust's share is a percentage that is fair and reasonable having regard to the extent of the trust's interest in the partnership.

    * (5) If the partnership's income year does not begin and end at the same time as the trust's income year, the trust's share is a percentage that is fair and reasonable having regard to all relevant circumstances.

##### 26915  Abnormal trading--general

    * (1) There is an **_abnormal trading_** in units in a unit trust if there is a trading in the units that is abnormal having regard to all relevant factors, including:

     * (a) the timing of the trading, when compared to the normal timing for trading in its units; and

     * (b) the number of units traded, when compared to the normal number of units traded; and

     * (c) any connection between the trading and any other trading in units in the trust; and

     * (d) any connection between the trading and a tax loss or other deduction of the trust.

    * (2) There may also be an **_abnormal trading_** under any of the following provisions.

##### 26920  Abnormal trading--suspected acquisition or merger

    * There is an **_abnormal trading_** in units in a unit trust if a trading occurs in its units that the trustee knows or reasonably suspects is part of an acquisition of the trust or merger of the trust with another trust.

##### 26925  Abnormal trading--5% of units in a single transaction

    * There is an **_abnormal trading_** in units in a unit trust (other than a wholesale widely held trust) if 5% or more of the units are traded in one transaction.

##### 26930  Abnormal trading--suspected 5% of units in a series of transactions

    * (1) There is an **_abnormal trading_** in units in a unit trust (other than a wholesale widely held trust) if the trustee knows or reasonably suspects that a person, or a person and one or more associates of the person, have acquired or redeemed 5% or more of the units in 2 or more transactions and would not have done so if the trust did not have a tax loss or other deduction.

    * (2) For the purposes of other provisions of this Schedule, the abnormal trading occurs at the time of the particular transaction that causes the 5% figure to be exceeded.

##### 26935  Abnormal trading--20% of units traded, issued or redeemed over 60 day period

    * (1) There is an **_abnormal trading_** in units in a unit trust (other than a wholesale widely held trust) if more than 20% of the units on issue at the end of any 60 day period were traded during the period.

    * (2) For the purposes of other provisions of this Schedule, the abnormal trading occurs at the end of the 60 day period.

##### 26940  Abnormal trading--50% stake not maintained

    * (1) There is an **_abnormal trading_** in units in a wholesale widely held trust during a period if the trustee knows or reasonably suspects that the same persons did not hold more than 50% of its units at the beginning and end of the period.

    * (2) For the purposes of other provisions of this Schedule, the abnormal trading occurs immediately before the end of the period.

##### 26945  Time at which trustee to have knowledge or suspicion

    * For the purposes of section 26920, 26930 or 26940, the trustee must have the knowledge or reasonable suspicion mentioned in that section:

     * (a) if the section is being applied in determining for the purposes of section 26820 whether an abnormal trading occurred--at some time during the income year mentioned in that section; or

     * (b) if it is being applied in determining for the purposes of any other provision whether an abnormal trading occurred during a period--at some time during the period.

##### 26947  Abnormal trading where holding trust

    * Holding trust and subsidiary trust

    * (1) If a unit trust has fixed entitlements directly or indirectly to all of the income and capital of another unit trust:

     * (a) the first trust is a **_holding trust _**of the second; and

     * (b) the second is a **_subsidiary trust_** of the first.

    * Abnormal trading causing or ending holdingsubsidiary relationship

    * (2) The transaction that causes a trust to become, or to cease to be, a holding trust of a subsidiary trust (the **_bottom subsidiary trust)_** is an **_abnormal trading_** in units in the bottom subsidiary trust unless:

     * (a) the holding trust is itself a subsidiary trust of one or more holding trusts (each of which is a **_higher holding trust_**); and

     * (b) immediately before and after the transaction, the bottom subsidiary trust is a subsidiary trust of one or more of the higher holding trusts.

    * Abnormal trading while holdingsubsidiary relationship exists

    * (3) While one or more trusts are holding trusts of the same subsidiary trust, there is an**_ abnormal trading_** in units in the subsidiary trust if and only if, and at the time at which, there is an abnormal trading in units in the holding trust that is not itself a subsidiary trust of another holding trust.

##### 26949  No abnormal trading where proportionate issue of units

    * If the issue of units in a unit trust to existing unit holders does not cause each unit holder's proportion of the total fixed entitlements to shares of the income and capital of the trust to change, then, except for the purposes of section 26920, the issue is disregarded in determining whether there has been an abnormal trading in units in the unit trust.

##### Subdivision 269C--Passing the 50% stake test etc.

##### 26950  More than a 50% stake in income or capital

    * More than a 50% stake in income

    * (1) If there are individuals who have (between them), directly or indirectly, and for their own benefit, fixed entitlements to a greater than 50% share of the income of a trust, those individuals have **_more than a 50% stake_** in the income of the trust.

    * More than a 50% stake in capital

    * (2) If there are individuals who have (between them), directly or indirectly, and for their own benefit, fixed entitlements to a greater than 50% share of the capital of the trust, those individuals have **_more than a 50% stake_** in the capital of the trust.

##### 26955  Passing the 50% stake test

    * (1) If, at all times during a period, or at 2 times:

     * (a) the same individuals have more than a 50% stake in the income of a trust; and

     * (b) the same individuals (who may be different from those in paragraph (a)) have more than a 50% stake in the capital of the trust;

    * the trust **_passes the 50% stake test_** for the period or in respect of the 2 times.

    * (2) If a trust is a widely held unit trust it is taken to **_pass the 50% stake test_** for a period or in respect of 2 times if it is reasonable to assume that the requirements of paragraphs (1)(a) and (b) are satisfied in respect of the period or the 2 times.

##### Subdivision 269D--Pattern of distributions test

##### 26960  Pattern of distributions test

    * A trust **_passes the pattern of distributions test_** for an income year if, before the end of 2 months after the end of the income year:

     * (a) the trust distributed directly or indirectly to the same individuals, for their own benefit, a greater than 50% share of all test year distributions of income (see subsection 26965(1)); and

     * (b) the trust distributed directly or indirectly to the same individuals (who may be different from those in paragraph (a)), for their own benefit, a greater than 50% share of all test year distributions of capital (see subsection 26965(3)).

##### 26965  Test year distribution of income or capital

    * Test year distribution of income

    * (1) A **_test year distribution of income_** is the total of all distributions of income made by the trust in any of the following periods, provided the period does not begin more than 6 years before the beginning of the income year:

     * (a) the period from the beginning of the income year until 2 months after its end;

     * (b) if the trust distributed income before the trigger year (see subsection (2))--the income year, before the trigger year, that is closest to the trigger year;

     * (c) if paragraph (b) does not apply and the trust distributed income in the trigger year--the trigger year;

     * (d) if neither paragraph (b) nor paragraph (c) applies--the income year, closest to the trigger year, in which the trust distributed income;

     * (e) each intervening income year (if any) between the one in paragraph (a) and the one in paragraph (b), (c) or (d).

    * Trigger year

    * (2) If this Subdivision is being applied for the purposes of section 26720, the **_trigger year_** is the loss year mentioned in that section. If it is being applied for the purposes of section 26725, the **_trigger year_** is the year in which the debt mentioned in that section was incurred.

    * Test year distribution of capital

    * (3) Subsection (1) applies in the same way to distributions of capital made by the trust, to determine what is a **_test year distribution of capital_**.

##### 26970  When individual receives different percentages

    * For the purposes of section 26960, if the trust does not distribute to an individual the same percentage of income or capital for every test year distribution, the trust is taken to have distributed to the individual, for every test year distribution, the smallest percentage that it distributed to the individual for any of the test year distributions.

##### 26975  Incomplete distributions

    * For the purposes of section 26960, if, before the end of 2 months after the end of the income year:

     * (a) the trust has distributed directly or indirectly the whole or part of a test year distribution of income or test year distribution of capital to a company, partnership or trust (the **_entity_**); and

     * (b) an amount (the **_undistributed amount_**) consisting of the whole or part of the income or capital so distributed to the entity satisfies the following requirements:

       * (i) the amount has not been distributed by the entity; and

       * (ii) an individual, directly or indirectly, and for his or her own benefit, has a fixed entitlement to a share of the amount;

    * the entity is taken to have distributed the share of the undistributed amount to the individual immediately before the end of 2 months after the end of the income year.

##### 26980  Where individual's death or breakdown of marriage or relationship

    * (1) For the purposes of section 26960, if:

     * (a) the trust distributes, directly or indirectly to an individual as mentioned in that section, income or capital that is included in a test year distribution; and

     * (b) a later distribution of income or capital is made that is included in the same or a different test year distribution; and

     * (c) either the individual dies before the later distribution is made or:

       * (i) before it is made, there is a breakdown in the marriage or relationship (see section 272140) of the individual; and

       * (ii) after the breakdown, no distribution of income or capital of the trust, that is included in a test year distribution, is made directly or indirectly to the individual; and

       * (iii) it is reasonable to assume that the breakdown in the marriage or relationship is the reason for no such distribution being made;

    * then subsections (2) and (3) apply.

    * (2) No income or capital distributed to the individual by the trust, directly or indirectly as mentioned in section 26960, is to be included in any test year distribution.

    * (3) If:

     * (a) the requirements of subsection (1) are met because the individual has died; and

     * (b) immediately before his or her death, the individual had directly or indirectly, and for his or her own benefit, a fixed entitlement to a share of the income or capital of the trust; and

     * (c) after the individual's death, the fixed entitlement is held by a person as trustee of the individual's estate or by a person who received it as a beneficiary of the estate;

    * no income or capital distributed to the person as such a trustee or beneficiary, directly or indirectly as mentioned in section 26960, is to be included in any test year distribution.

##### 26985  Arrangements to pass pattern of distributions test

    * (1) The trust is taken for the purposes of section 26960 not to have distributed, directly or indirectly to an individual, and for the individual's own benefit, a share of a test year distribution of income or capital of the trust if the condition in subsection (2) is met.

    * (2) The condition is that an arrangement was entered into where:

     * (a) the arrangement in some way (directly or indirectly) related to, affected or depended for its operation on the share or its value; and

     * (b) the purpose, or one of the purposes, of the arrangement was to ensure that the trust would meet the condition in subsection 26730(2).

##### Subdivision 269E--Control a nonfixed trust

##### 26995  Control a nonfixed trust

    * Basic meaning

    * (1) Subject to this section, a group (see subsection (5)) **_controls a nonfixed trust_** if:

     * (a) the group has the power, by means of the exercise of a power of appointment or revocation or otherwise, to obtain beneficial enjoyment (directly or indirectly) of the capital or income of the trust; or

     * (b) the group is able (directly or indirectly) to control the application of the capital or income of the trust; or

     * (c) the group is capable, under a scheme, of gaining the beneficial enjoyment in paragraph (a) or the control in paragraph (b); or

     * (d) the trustee is accustomed, under an obligation or might reasonably be expected, to act in accordance with the directions, instructions or wishes of the group; or

     * (e) the group is able to remove or appoint the trustee; or

     * (f) the group acquires more than a 50% stake in the income or capital of the trust.

    * Replacement group after death etc.

    * (2) The consequences set out in subsection (3) apply if:

     * (a) a group (the **_original group_**) ceases to control a nonfixed trust only because of the death, incapacitation or breakdown in the marriage or relationship of the individual comprising, or an individual included in, the group; and

     * (b) another group (the **_replacement group_**) begins to control the trust within the following period (whether or not any other group controlled the trust in the interim):

       * (i) one year after the death, incapacitation or breakdown in the marriage or relationship; or

       * (ii) such longer period as the Commissioner determines in relation to the death, incapacitation or breakdown in the marriage or relationship; and

     * (c) the replacement group consists of:

       * (i) if the individual who died or became incapacitated or whose marriage or relationship broke down comprised the original group--one or more individuals who are members of the individual's family (see section 27295); or

       * (ii) in any other case--one or more such individuals together with all of the persons who were members of the original group, other than any individual who has died or become incapacitated or whose marriage or relationship has broken down; and

     * (d) the replacement group began to control the trust only because of the death, incapacitation or breakdown in the marriage or relationship of the individual; and

     * (e) disregarding any individual who died or became incapacitated or whose marriage or relationship broke down and the one or more individuals covered by paragraph (c)--the beneficiaries of the trust immediately before the original group ceased to control the trust are the beneficiaries of the trust immediately after the replacement group begins to control the trust.

    * Consequences of subsection (2)

    * (3) For the purposes of subsection (2), the consequences are that:

     * (a) the replacement group is taken to have controlled the trust from the time when the original group began to control it until the time when the replacement group actually began to control it; and

     * (b) the original group is taken _not_ to have controlled the trust; and

     * (c) if:

       * (i) a person or persons (other than a replacement group) began to control the trust at some time during the period from the time the original group ceased to control the trust until the replacement group began to do so; and

       * (ii) the person or persons began to control the trust only because of the death, incapacitation or breakdown in the marriage or relationship of the individual; and

    * Deemed absence of control

    * (4) If:

     * (a) at a particular time, a group controls a nonfixed trust; and

     * (b) the Commissioner, having regard to:

       * (i) the identity of the beneficiaries of the trust at any time before and at any time after the group began to control the trust; and

       * (ii) all other relevant circumstances;

     * considers that it is reasonable that the group be taken not to control the trust at the particular time;

     * (a) a person; or

##### Subdivision 269F--Same business test

##### 269100  Passing the same business test

    * Basic meaning

    * (1) A listed widely held trust **_passes the same business test_** during a period (the **_same business test period_**) in relation to a time (the **_test time_**) if throughout the same business test period it carries on the same business as it carried on immediately before the test time.

    * Relevance of being a trust

    * (2) The mere fact of being a trust does not mean that the trust cannot carry on a business.

    * First exception

    * (3) However, the trust does _not_ pass the same business test if, at any time during the same business test period, it derives assessable income from:

     * (a) a business of a kind that it did not carry on before the test time; or

     * (b) a transaction of a kind that it had not entered into in the course of its business operations before the test time.

    * Second exception

    * (4) The trust also does _not_ pass the same business test if, before the test time, it:

     * (a) began to carry on a business it had not previously carried on; or

     * (b) in the course of its business operations, entered into a transaction of a kind that it had not previously entered into;

    * and did so for the purpose, or for purposes including the purpose, of being taken to have carried on throughout the same business test period the same business as it carried on immediately before the test time.

    * Third exception

    * (5) So far as the test is applied for the purpose of section 266115 (Listed widely held trust may be required to work out its net income and tax loss in a special way) and section 26820 (Widely held unit trust's income year to be divided into periods), the trust also does _not_ pass the test if, at any time during the same business test period, it incurs expenditure:

     * (a) in carrying on a business of a kind that it did not carry on before the test time; or

     * (b) as a result of a transaction of a kind that it had not entered into in the course of its business operations before the test time.

#### Division 270--Schemes to take advantage of deductions

##### 2705  What this Division is about

    * A trust may be prevented from making any use of deductions, or full use of deductions in an income year, if a scheme to take advantage of the deductions exists.

##### 27010  Schemes to take advantage of deductions

    * Basic case

    * (1) The consequences set out in section 27015 result if:

     * (a) a deduction is allowable to a trust for the income year; and

     * (b) under a scheme, the following happen (in any order):

       * (i) the trust derives an amount of assessable income (the **_scheme assessable income_**) in the income year; and

       * (ii) an outsider to the trust (see section 27025) directly or indirectly provides a benefit (see section 27020) to the trustee, to a beneficiary in the trust or to an associate of the trustee or of a beneficiary; and

          * Note: The benefit may constitute all or any of the scheme assessable income.

       * (iii) the trustee, a beneficiary in the trust or an associate of the trustee or of a beneficiary, directly or indirectly provides a benefit to the outsider to the trust or to an associate of the outsider (other than an associate covered by any of paragraphs 27025(1)(a) to (f)); and

          * Note: The benefit may constitute all or any of the deduction.

     * (c) it is reasonable to conclude that:

       * (i) the trust derived the scheme assessable income; or

       * (ii) the outsider provided the benefit as mentioned in subparagraph (b)(ii); or

       * (iii) the trustee, beneficiary or associate provided the benefit as mentioned in subparagraph (b)(iii);

     * wholly or partly, but not merely incidentally, because the deduction would be allowable; and

     * (d) the trust is not an excepted trust under paragraph 272100(b), (c) or (d).

    * Special case

    * (2) If:

     * (a) under a scheme, a person who, before the scheme was entered into, was an outsider to a trust becomes:

       * (i) the trustee of the trust; or

       * (ii) a person with a fixed entitlement to a share of the income or capital of the trust; and

     * (b) if the person had not ceased to be an outsider to the trust, the requirements of subsection (1) would have been satisfied in relation to the scheme;

    * the requirements of subsection (1) are taken to have been satisfied in relation to the scheme.

##### 27015  Tax consequences of schemes

    * If the requirements of subsection 27010(1) are satisfied, the consequences are that:

     * (a) to the extent (if any) that the deduction mentioned in paragraph 27010(1)(a) relates exclusively, or may appropriately be related, to the scheme assessable income, the deduction is not allowable; and

     * (b) if the net income of the trust is less than the scheme assessable income or there is no net income--the trust has a net income equal to, or the net income is increased so that it equals, the scheme assessable income; and

     * (c) paragraph (b) and the scheme assessable income are disregarded in working out any tax loss incurred by the trust in the income year; and

     * (d) if paragraph (b) applies and the deduction mentioned in paragraph 27010(1)(a) is for a tax loss--paragraph (b) and the scheme assessable income are disregarded in working out any deduction in respect of the tax loss allowable after the income year.

##### 27020  Benefit

    * A **_benefit_** is:

     * (a) money, a dividend or property (whether tangible or intangible); or

     * (b) a right or entitlement (whether or not property); or

     * (c) services; or

     * (d) the extinguishment, forgiveness, release or waiver of a debt or other liability; or

     * (e) the doing of anything that results in the derivation of assessable income; or

     * (f) anything that, disregarding the preceding paragraphs, is a benefit or advantage.

##### 27025  Outsider to trust

    * Outsider to family trust

    * (1) If the trust mentioned in paragraph 27010(1)(a) is a family trust, an **_outsider to the trust_** is a person other than:

     * (a) the trustee of the trust; or

     * (b) a person with a fixed entitlement to a share of the income or capital of the trust; or

     * (c) the individual specified in the trust's family trust election; or

     * (d) a member of the individual's family; or

     * (da) a trust with the same individual specified in its family trust election; or

     * (e) a company, partnership or trust that made an interposed entity election to be included in the individual's family group, where the election was in force (including before it was made) when the scheme mentioned in paragraph 27010(1)(b) commenced; or

     * (f) a fixed trust, company or partnership (an **_entity_**) where, at all times while the scheme mentioned in paragraph 27010(1)(b) was being carried out:

       * (i) the individual specified in the trust's family trust election; or

       * (ii) one or more members of the individual's family; or

       * (iii) the trustees of one or more family trusts, provided the individual is specified in the family trust election of each of those family trusts;

     * or any combination of the above, had fixed entitlements, directly or indirectly, and for their own benefit, to all of the income and capital of the entity.

    * Outsider to nonfamily trust

    * (2) If the trust mentioned in paragraph 27010(1)(a) is not a family trust, an **_outsider to the trust_** is a person other than:

     * (a) the trustee of the trust; or

     * (b) a person with a fixed entitlement to a share of the income or capital of the trust.

    * (1) If, under a trust instrument, a beneficiary has a vested and indefeasible interest in a share of income of the trust that the trust derives from time to time, or of the capital of the trust, the beneficiary has a **_fixed entitlement_** to that share of the income or capital.

    * Case where interest not defeasible

    * (2) If:

     * (a) a person holds units in a unit trust; and

     * (b) the units are redeemable or further units are able to be issued; and

     * (c) if units in the unit trust are listed for quotation in the official list of an approved stock exchange--the units held by the person will be redeemed, or any further units will be issued, for the price at which other units of the same kind in the unit trust are offered for sale on the approved stock exchange at the time of the redemption or issue; and

     * (d) if the units are not listed as mentioned in paragraph (c)--the units held by the person will be redeemed, or any further units will be issued, for a price determined on the basis of the net asset value, according to Australian accounting principles, of the unit trust at the time of the redemption or issue;

    * then the mere fact that the units are redeemable, or that the further units are able to be issued, does not mean that the person's interest, as a unit holder, in the income or capital of the unit trust is defeasible.

    * Deemed fixed entitlement

    * (3) If:

     * (a) a beneficiary with an interest in a share of income that the trust derives from time to time, or of the capital of a trust, does not have a fixed entitlement to the share; and

    * Deemed fixed entitlement

    * (2) If:
