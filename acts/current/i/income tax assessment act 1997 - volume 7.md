##### Guide to Division 315

##### 3151  What this Division is about

     * This Division sets out the taxation consequences of the demutualisation of private health insurers.

     * Policy holders, demutualising health insurers and certain other entities can disregard capital gains and losses arising under a demutualisation (see Subdivision 315A).

     * Shares and rights issued under the demutualisation are given a cost base based on the market value of the demutualising health insurer at the time of issue (see Subdivisions 315B and 315D).

     * Assets held by a lost policy holders trust are given rollover relief if transferred to the lost policy holder, or if the lost policy holder becomes absolutely entitled to them. Otherwise the trustee of the lost policy holders trust is taxed on any capital gains (see Subdivision 315C).

     * A legal personal representative can disregard capital gains and losses made when passing an asset to a beneficiary of a policy holder's estate (see Subdivision 315E).

     * Shares, rights or cash received under a demutualisation are not assessable income and not exempt income (see Subdivision 315F).

Method statement

        * Step 1.	Start with the *market value of the demutualising health insurer on the day the asset is issued.

        * Step 2.	Divide the result of step 1 by the sum of:

          * (a) the number of shares in the entity that are issued under the demutualisation; and

          * (b) the number of shares in the entity that can be *acquired under rights that are demutualisation assets issued under the demutualisation.

        * Step 3.	The result of step 2 is the first element of the *cost base and *reduced cost base of the asset, unless the asset is a right.

        * Step 4.	If the asset is a right, multiply the result of step 2 by the number of shares that can be *acquired under the right. The result is the first element of the *cost base and *reduced cost base of the asset.

          * Example: Wellbeing Health demutualises on 1 April 2008 and has a market value of $400 million on that day. It distributes its accumulated mutual surplus in the form of rights to acquire shares in its holding company Healthiness Insurance Ltd (Healthiness). The rights do not have an exercise price.

          * A total of 800 million shares can be acquired in Healthiness under rights issued under the demutualisation. Each right allows the holder to acquire 50 shares. No shares in Healthiness are issued.

          * Under the method statement, the first element of the cost base and reduced cost base of each right is worked out by dividing the market value of Wellbeing Health (step 1) by the number of shares in Healthiness that can be acquired under the demutualisation (step 2) and multiplying the result by the number of shares that can be acquired under the right (step 4):

     * Acquisition rule

     * (3) The participating policy holder or trustee is taken to have *acquired the *CGT asset at the time it is issued.

##### Table of sections

       * 315260	Special CGT rule for legal personal representatives and beneficiaries

##### 315260  Special CGT rule for legal personal representatives and beneficiaries

     * (1) This section sets out what happens if a *CGT asset:

      * (a) is a demutualisation asset; and

      * (b) forms part of the estate of a participating policy holder mentioned in subsection 31590(1) who has died, but was not owned by the policy holder just before dying; and

      * (c) *passes to a beneficiary in the policy holder's estate because the asset is transferred to the beneficiary by the policy holder's *legal personal representative.

          * Note: Division 128 deals with the effect of death in relation to CGT assets a person owns just before dying.

     * (2) Disregard a *capital gain or *capital loss the *legal personal representative makes if the asset *passes to a beneficiary in the policy holder's estate.

     * Consequence for beneficiary

     * (3) The *cost base and *reduced cost base of the asset in the hands of the *legal personal representative just before the asset *passes to the beneficiary becomes the first element of the cost base and reduced cost base of the asset in the hands of the beneficiary.

     * (4) The beneficiary is taken to have *acquired the asset when the *legal personal representative acquired it.

##### Gains and losses of members, insured entities and successors

##### 31655  Disregarding capital gains and losses, except some involving receipt of money

     * (1) Disregard an entity's *capital gain or *capital loss from a *CGT event that happens under the demutualisation to a *CGT asset if:

      * (a) the entity:

        * (i) is or has been a *member of the *friendly society; or

        * (ii) is or has been insured through the friendly society or a health/life insurance subsidiary of the friendly society; and

      * (b) the CGT asset is one of these (an **_interest affected by demutualisation_**):

        * (i) an interest in the friendly society as the owner or holder of a policy of insurance with the friendly society or health/life insurance subsidiary;

        * (ii) a *membership interest in the friendly society;

        * (iii) a right or interest of another kind in the friendly society;

        * (iv) a right or interest of another kind that arises under the demutualisation, except an interest in a lost policy holders trust (see section 316155).

          * Note: Subdivision 316D deals with the effects of CGT events happening to interests in lost policy holders trusts.

     * (2) Disregard a *capital gain or *capital loss of an entity (the **_successor_**) from a *CGT event that happens under the demutualisation to a *CGT asset if:

      * (a) the successor is the *legal personal representative, or beneficiary in the estate, of a deceased individual who was:

        * (i) a *member of the *friendly society; or

        * (ii) insured through the friendly society or a health/life insurance subsidiary of the friendly society; and

      * (b) the CGT asset:

        * (i) forms part of the deceased individual's estate; and

        * (ii) devolves or *passes to the successor; and

        * (iii) is an interest affected by demutualisation (see paragraph (1)(b)).

##### 31660  Taking account of some capital gains and losses involving receipt of money

     * (1) This section applies if:

      * (a) a *CGT event happens under the demutualisation to an entity's interest affected by demutualisation (see section 31655); and

      * (b) the event involves:

        * (i) the variation or abrogation of rights attaching to or consisting of the interest; or

        * (ii) the conversion, cancellation, extinguishment or redemption of the interest; and

      * (c) either:

        * (i) the entity is one described in paragraph 31655(1)(a); or

        * (ii) the entity is one described in paragraph 31655(2)(a) and the interest is a *CGT asset described in paragraph 31655(2)(b); and

      * (d) the *capital proceeds from the event include or consist of money received by the entity.

     * (2) Work out whether the entity makes a *capital gain or *capital loss from the *CGT event, and the amount of the gain or loss, assuming that:

      * (a) the *capital proceeds from the CGT event were the amount they would be if they did not include any *market value of property other than money; and

      * (b) the *cost base and *reduced cost base for the interest were the amount worked out using the formula:

          * Example: Assume the entity receives $50 in money and 10 shares with a market value of $4 each in respect of CGT event C2 happening, and that the valuation factor worked out under section 31665 is 0.9. The entity makes a capital gain from the event of $5, worked out as follows:

          * This ignores the market value of the shares because they are property other than money.

          * Note: Division 114 (Indexation of cost base) is not relevant, because this section provides exhaustively for working out the amount of the cost base.

     * (3) The *capital gain or *capital loss is not to be disregarded, despite:

      * (a) section 31655; and

      * (b) any provision of this Act for disregarding the *capital gain or *capital loss because the interest affected by demutualisation was *acquired before 20 September 1985.

          * Note: The capital gain is not a discount capital gain: see section 11555.

##### 31665  Valuation factor for sections 31660, 316105 and 316165

     * (1) For the purposes of sections 31660, 316105 and 316165, the valuation factor is the amount worked out using the formula:

     * where: 

     * **_embedded value of the friendly society's other business (if any)_** means the amount that would be the value of the *friendly society worked out under section 31670 assuming that neither the friendly society, nor any health/life insurance subsidiary of it, *carried on any health insurance business within the meaning of the _Private Health Insurance Act 2007_.

     * **_market value of the friendly society's health insurance business (if any)_** means the total *market value of every health insurance business, within the meaning of the _Private Health Insurance Act 2007_, *carried on by either or both of the *friendly society and its health/life insurance subsidiaries (if any), taking account of any consideration paid to the society or subsidiary for disposal or control of that business.

     * (2) Disregard paragraph 31660(2)(a) for the purposes of the formula in subsection (1) of this section.

##### 31670  Value of the friendly society

     * (1) The value of the *friendly society is the sum, worked out in accordance with this section, of the friendly society's existing business value and its adjusted net worth on the day (the **_applicable accounting day_**) identified under subsection (3).

     * Eligible actuary and Australian actuarial practice

     * (2) The sum is to be worked out, according to Australian actuarial practice, by an *actuary who is not an employee of:

      * (a) the *friendly society; or

      * (b) a health/life insurance subsidiary of the friendly society; or

      * (c) an entity of which the friendly society is to become a *whollyowned subsidiary under the demutualisation.

     * Applicable accounting day

     * (3) The applicable accounting day is:

      * (a) if an accounting period of the *friendly society ends on the day (the **_demutualisation resolution day_**) identified under subsection (4)--that day; or

      * (b) in any other case--the last day of the most recent accounting period of the friendly society ending before the demutualisation resolution day.

     * Demutualisation resolution day

     * (4) The demutualisation resolution day is:

      * (a) the day on which the resolution to proceed with the demutualisation is passed; or

      * (b) if, under the demutualisation, the whole of the *life insurance business of the *friendly society or of a health/life insurance subsidiary of the friendly society is transferred to another company under a scheme confirmed by the Federal Court of Australia--the day (or the last day) on which the transfer takes place.

     * Adjustment for changes after applicable accounting day

     * (5) In a case covered by paragraph (3)(b), if any significant change in the amount of the existing business value or adjusted net worth occurs between the applicable accounting day and the demutualisation resolution day, the amount is to be adjusted to take account of the change.

     * Continued business assumption

     * (6) In working out the existing business value or the adjusted net worth, assume:

      * (a) that after the applicable accounting day the *friendly society, and any health/life insurance subsidiary of the friendly society, will continue to conduct *business and any other activity in the same way as before that day, and will not conduct any different business or other activity; and

      * (b) that the demutualisation will not occur; and

      * (c) that any health/life insurance subsidiary of the friendly society will continue to be a *whollyowned subsidiary of the friendly society.

     * Expenditure assumption

     * (7) In working out the existing business value, assume that expenditure that the *friendly society and any of its health/life insurance subsidiaries will incur, in conducting *business, on recurring items after the demutualisation resolution day will be of the same kinds and amounts (increased to take account of any inflation) as it incurred in the accounting period, or part of an accounting period, ending on the demutualisation resolution day.

##### Friendly society's gains and losses

##### 31675  Disregarding friendly society's capital gains and losses

     * Disregard the *friendly society's *capital gain or *capital loss from a *CGT event that happens under the demutualisation.

##### Other entities' gains and losses

##### 31680  Disregarding other entities' capital gains and losses

     * Disregard an entity's *capital gain or *capital loss from a *CGT event that happens under the demutualisation if:

      * (a) the entity is established solely for the purpose of participating in the demutualisation and is not a lost policy holders trust (see section 316155); and

      * (b) the CGT event:

        * (i) happens before or at the same time as the allocation or distribution of the accumulated surplus of the *friendly society; and

        * (ii) is connected to that allocation or distribution.

          * Note: The allocation or distribution of the accumulated surplus could happen through an arrangement involving more than one transaction.

        * (ii) the conversion, cancellation, extinguishment or redemption of an interest affected by demutualisation.

     * Exclusion for rights with an exercise price

     * (2) Despite subsection (1), this section does not cover a right to *acquire a *share in an entity if the holder of the right must pay an amount to exercise the right.

     * Exclusion where assets not issued simultaneously

##### 316155  Lost policy holders trust

     * (1) This Subdivision applies if the conditions in subsections (2) and (5) are met.

     * First condition

     * (2) The first condition is that, under the demutualisation, a trust (the **_lost policy holders trust_**) exists solely for one or both of the purposes that are described in subsection (3) in relation to persons (**_beneficiaries of the lost policy holders trust_**) covered by subsection (4).

     * (3) The purposes are as follows:

      * (a) holding demutualisation assets (see section 316110) that are *shares or rights to *acquire shares, or proceeds from disposal of those assets, on behalf of one or more beneficiaries of the lost policy holders trust and transferring those assets or proceeds to those beneficiaries;

      * (b) holding on behalf of one or more beneficiaries of the lost policy holders trust, and paying to them, money payable to them for:

        * (i) the variation or abrogation of rights attaching to or consisting of the beneficiaries' interests affected by demutualisation (see paragraph 31655(1)(b)); or

        * (ii) the conversion, cancellation, extinguishment or redemption of those interests.

     * (4) This subsection covers:

     * Second condition

     * (5) The second condition is that, under the demutualisation, the trustee of the lost policy holders trust is:

      * (a) issued with demutualisation assets that are *shares, or rights to *acquire shares; or

      * (b) paid money described in paragraph (3)(b) to hold and pay to beneficiaries of the lost policy holders trust.

##### Effects of CGT events happening to interests and assets in trust

##### 316160  Disregarding beneficiaries' capital gains and losses, except some involving receipt of money

     * Disregard a *capital gain or *capital loss of a beneficiary of the lost policy holders trust from a *CGT event that happens to the beneficiary's interest in the trust.

##### 316165  Taking account of some capital gains and losses involving receipt of money by beneficiaries

     * (1) This section applies if:

      * (a) a *CGT event happens to an interest of a beneficiary of the lost policy holders trust in that trust; and

      * (b) the *capital proceeds from the event include or consist of money received by the beneficiary.

     * (2) Work out whether the beneficiary makes a *capital gain or *capital loss from the *CGT event, and the amount of the gain or loss, assuming that:

      * (a) the *capital proceeds from the CGT event were the amount they would be if they did not include any *market value of property other than money; and

      * (b) the *cost base and *reduced cost base for the interest were the amount worked out using the formula:

          * Example: Assume that the beneficiary of the lost policy holders trust is paid $50 in money by the trustee to satisfy the beneficiary's interest in the trust so that a CGT event happens, and that the valuation factor worked out under section 31665 is 0.9. The beneficiary makes a capital gain from the event of $5, worked out as follows:

          * Note: Division 114 (Indexation of cost base) is not relevant, because this section provides exhaustively for working out the amount of the cost base.

     * (3) The *capital gain or *capital loss is not to be disregarded, despite sections 31655 and 316160.

          * Note: The capital gain is not a discount capital gain: see section 11555.

##### 316170  Rollover where shares or rights to acquire shares transferred to beneficiary of lost policy holders trust

     * (1) This section applies in relation to a *CGT event if:

        * (i) is a *share or a right to *acquire one or more shares; and

        * (ii) is held by the trustee of the lost policy holders trust on behalf of a beneficiary of the lost policy holders trust; and

      * (b) the CGT event happens because the beneficiary of the lost policy holders trust either:

        * (i) is transferred the asset by the trustee; or

        * (ii) becomes absolutely entitled to the asset.

     * Consequence for trustee

     * (2) Disregard a *capital gain or *capital loss the trustee makes from the *CGT event.

     * Consequences for beneficiary

     * (3) The *cost base and *reduced cost base of the asset in the hands of the trustee of the lost policy holders trust just before the *CGT event becomes the first element of the cost base and reduced cost base of the asset in the hands of the beneficiary of the lost policy holders trust.

          * Note: Section 316105 affects the cost base of the asset in the hands of the trustee of the lost policy holders trust if the asset is covered by section 316110.

     * (4) The beneficiary of the lost policy holders trust is taken to have *acquired the asset when the trustee acquired it.

##### 316175  Trustee assessed if shares or rights dealt with not for benefit of beneficiary of lost policy holders trust

##### Subdivision 316F--NonCGT consequences of the demutualisation

##### Guide to Subdivision 316F

##### 316250  What this Subdivision is about

     * In many cases, income from demutualisation is assessed through the CGT provisions rather than as ordinary income or other statutory income.

     * Franking debits arise for the friendly society and its subsidiaries to ensure they do not enjoy a franking surplus. Franking debits and credits arise to negate credits and debits from things attributable to the time before demutualisation.

      * (b) the amount is a payment made to the entity, under the demutualisation, in connection with:

        * (i) the variation or abrogation of rights attaching to or consisting of an interest affected by demutualisation (see paragraph 31655(1)(b)); or

        * (ii) the conversion, cancellation, extinguishment or redemption of an interest affected by demutualisation; or

     * (2) The amount of the *franking debit equals the *surplus.

     * (3) The *franking debit arises at the start of that day.

##### 316265  Franking debits to negate franking credits from some distributions to friendly society and subsidiaries

     * (1) This section applies if a *franking credit arises in the *franking account of the *friendly society or a *whollyowned subsidiary of the society because a *distribution declared before the demutualisation resolution day identified under subsection 31670(4) is made to the society or subsidiary on or after that day.

##### Guide to Division 320

##### 3201  What this Division is about

     * This Division provides for the taxation of life insurance companies in a broadly comparable way to other entities that derive similar kinds of income. 

     * Because of the nature of the business of life insurance companies, the Division contains special rules for working out their taxable income.

     * Those rules: 

      *  	include certain amounts in assessable income;

      *  	identify certain amounts of exempt income and nonassessable nonexempt income;

      *  	identify specific deductions.

     * Life insurance companies can have one or both of these taxable incomes for any income year for the purposes of working out their income tax for that year: 

      *  	a taxable income of the complying superannuation/FHSA class, which consists of taxable income that relates to complying superannuation business or FHSAs, and is taxed at the rate of tax that applies to complying superannuation funds;

      *  	a taxable income of the ordinary class, which consists of taxable income that relates to other businesses and is taxed at the corporate tax rate.

     * Life insurance companies can also have tax losses that correspond to those 2 classes. The Division provides that tax losses of a particular class can be deducted only from incomes in respect of that class.

     * The Division ensures that the income tax worked out on the basis of these taxable incomes and tax losses is a single amount of income tax on one taxable income.

     * The Division also contains rules for segregating the assets of life insurance companies into: 

      *  	assets that relate to complying superannuation business or FHSAs;

      *  	assets that relate to immediate annuity and other exempt business.

     * This Division also ensures that life insurance companies that are RSA providers are liable to pay tax on noTFN contributions income.

##### Operative provisions

##### Subdivision 320A--Preliminary

##### 3205  Object of Division

     * (1) The object of this Division is to provide for the taxation of *life insurance companies in a broadly comparable way to other entities that *derive similar kinds of income.

     * (2) To achieve this object, the Division:

      * (a) identifies certain amounts that are included in the assessable income, or are *exempt income or *nonassessable nonexempt income, of a *life insurance company; and

      * (b) identifies certain amounts that a life insurance company can deduct; and

      * (c) enables a life insurance company to have taxable incomes and *tax losses of the following classes for the purposes of working out its income tax for an income year:

        * (i) the *complying superannuation/FHSA class;

        * (ii) the *ordinary class; and

      * (d) contains other provisions necessary to enable the income tax on the taxable income of a life insurance company to be worked out.

          * Note: Section 3205 of the _Income Tax (Transitional Provisions) Act 1997_ provides that the tax consequences of certain transfers of assets of a life insurance company that is a friendly society to a complying superannuation fund are to be disregarded.

##### Subdivision 320D--Income tax, taxable income and tax loss of life insurance companies

##### Guide to Subdivision 320D

##### 320130  What this Subdivision is about

     * This Subdivision explains how a life insurance company's income tax is worked out.

     * For that purpose, this Subdivision enables a life insurance company to have taxable incomes and tax losses of the following classes:

      *  	the complying superannuation/FHSA class;

      *  	the ordinary class.

##### 320131  Overview of Subdivision

     * Working out the income tax

     * (1) In any income year, a life insurance company can have:

      * (a) a taxable income of the complying superannuation/FHSA class and/or a taxable income of the ordinary class; or

      * (b) a tax loss of the complying superannuation/FHSA class and/or a tax loss of the ordinary class; or

      * (c) a taxable income of one class and a tax loss of the other class.

          * Note: The taxable incomes mentioned in paragraph (a) are taxed at different rates: see section 23A of the _Income Tax Rates Act 1986_.

     * (2) Taxable incomes and tax losses of both classes are taken into account in working out the amount of income tax that the company has to pay for the income year (see section 320134). That amount is then taken to be the income tax on the company's taxable income for that income year.

     * Working out taxable income and tax loss of each class

     * (3) In general, the rules in this Act about working out a company's taxable income or tax loss, or deducting a company's tax loss, apply to a life insurance company in relation to:

      * (a) working out a taxable income or tax loss of a particular class; or

      * (b) deducting a tax loss of a particular class.

     * (4) However, that general rule is subject to the following:

      * (a) sections 320137 to 320143, which allocate amounts of incomes and deductions for the purposes of working out a taxable income or tax loss of a particular class;

      * (b) subsections 320141(2) and 320143(2), which provide that tax losses of a particular class can be deducted only from incomes in respect of that class;

      * (c) section 320149, which sets out the provisions in this Act that have effect only in relation to a taxable income or tax loss of the ordinary class.

##### General rules

##### 320133  Object of Subdivision

     * (1) The object of this Subdivision is to ensure that:

      * (a) for the purposes of working out the amount of a *life insurance company's income tax for an income year:

        * (i) the company's taxable income or *tax loss of one *class is worked out separately from its taxable income or tax loss of the other class; and

        * (ii) the company's tax losses of a particular class can be deducted only from its incomes in respect of that class; and

      * (b) for the purposes of this Act, that amount of income tax is treated as the company's income tax on its taxable income for that income year.

     * (2) In subsection (1), a **_class_** means the *complying superannuation/FHSA class or the *ordinary class.

##### 320134  Income tax of a life insurance company

     * Working out the income tax

     * (1) Work out a *life insurance company's income tax for an income year under section 410 as follows:

      * (a) apply step and 2 of the method statement in subsection 410(3) to work out separately the amount that would be the company's basic income tax liability for its taxable income of each *class for that year;

      * (b) treat the sum of these amounts as the company's basic income tax liability for that year and apply step 4 of the method statement to subtract its *tax offsets from that sum.

     * (2) For the purposes of this Act:

      * (a) the income tax worked out in accordance with subsection (1) is taken to be the company's income tax on its taxable income for the income year; and

      * (b) except as provided by subsection (1) of this section and sections 320135 to 320149, the company's taxable income for that year is taken to be equal to the sum of the company's taxable incomes of the 2 *classes for that year.

          * Note: This means that there is only one assessment in respect of the company's taxable income for the income year and that the income tax constitutes only one debt to the Commonwealth.

     * Working out the income tax on certain assumptions

     * (3) Subsection (1) also has effect in relation to working out an amount that would be the company's income tax if certain assumptions were made. It has that effect in the same way as it has effect in relation to working out the company's income tax under section 410 (except in regard to those assumptions).

          * Note: This means, for example, subsection (1) also has effect in relation to working out the amount of a life insurance company's income tax on the basis of the tax offset priority rules in Division 63.

##### 320135  Taxable income and tax loss of each of the 2 classes

     * (1) Subject to the other provisions in this Subdivision:

      * (a) this Act has effect for a *life insurance company in relation to working out a taxable income of a particular *class in the same way as it has effect in relation to working out a taxable income of any other company; and

      * (b) this Act has effect for a life insurance company in relation to working out or deducting a *tax loss of a particular class in the same way as it has effect in relation to working out or deducting a tax loss of any other company.

     * (2) Sections 320137 to 320143 have effect in addition to other provisions in this Act that relate to working out a taxable income or *tax loss, or deducting a tax loss (as appropriate).

     * (3) Nothing in this Subdivision prevents a *life insurance company from:

      * (a) having taxable incomes, or *tax losses, of both *classes for the same income year; or

      * (b) having a taxable income of one class and a tax loss of the other class for the same income year.

          * Note: In certain circumstances, a life insurance company can have a taxable income and a tax loss of the same class in an income year (see Subdivision 165B as it has effect under this Subdivision).

      * (b) an asset (other than money) is transferred to a complying superannuation/FHSA asset pool under subsection 320180(3) or section 320185.

     * (2) In determining:

      * (a) for the purposes of this Act (other than Parts 31 and 33) whether an amount is included in, or can be deducted from, the assessable income of a *life insurance company in respect of the transfer of the asset; or

      * (b) for the purposes of Parts 31 and 33:

        * (i) whether the company made a *capital gain in respect of the transfer of the asset; or

        * (ii) whether the company made a *capital loss in respect of the transfer of the asset;

     * the company is taken: 

      * (c) to have sold, immediately before the transfer, the asset transferred for a consideration equal to its *market value; and

      * (d) to have purchased the asset again at the time of the transfer for a consideration equal to its market value.

     * (2A) Without limiting subsection (2), where the asset transferred is a *depreciating asset, Division 40 has effect for the company as if:

      * (a) in relation to the sale of the asset that is taken to have occurred under paragraph (2)(c):

        * (i) the sale were a *balancing adjustment event; and

        * (ii) the *termination value of the asset for that event were equal to the consideration for the sale under that paragraph; and

        * (iii) the company had acquired the asset from an *associate of the company.

          * Note: This means that, amongst other things, as a result of the transfer:

           * the asset's cost for the purposes of working out a deduction under Division 40 is reset; and

           * the company's assessable income might be adjusted under section 40285.

     * (3) If, apart from this subsection and section 32055, a *life insurance company could deduct an amount or make a *capital loss as a result of a transfer of an asset to or from its *complying superannuation/FHSA asset pool, the deduction or capital loss is disregarded until:

      * (a) the asset ceases to exist; or

      * (b) the asset, or a greater than 50% interest in it, is *acquired by an entity other than an entity that is an *associate of the company immediately after the transfer.

     * (4) Subsection (3) does not apply in relation to an amount that the company can deduct under a provision in Division 40.

      * (b) the trustee of the fund holds the original policy.

     * (2) A part of a *life insurance policy (the **_original policy_**) is taken to be an *exempt life insurance policy for the purposes of this Act if:

     * What happens to the rest of the policy?

     * (3) If a part of a policy (the **_original policy_**) is taken to be an *exempt life insurance policy under subsection (1) or (2), the rest of the original policy is taken to be another *life insurance policy for the purposes of this Act.

##### 320250  Transfer of assets and payment of amounts from segregated exempt assets otherwise than as a result of a valuation under section 320230

     * (1) A *life insurance company can at any time transfer an asset from its*segregated exempt assets in exchange for an amount of money equal to the *transfer value of the asset at the time of the transfer.

     * (2) If a *life insurance company:

      * (a) imposes any fees or charges in respect of *segregated exempt assets; or

      * (b) imposes any fees or charges in respect of *exempt life insurance policies where the liabilities under the policies are to be discharged out of the company's segregated exempt assets; or

      * (c) determines, at a time other than a *valuation time, that the total *transfer value of the company's segregated exempt assets as at that time exceeds the amount of the company's *exempt life insurance policy liabilities as at that time;

     * the company must, when the fees or charges are imposed or the excess is determined, as the case may be, transfer from the segregated exempt assets, assets having a total transfer value equal to the fees, charges or excess, as the case may be.

     * (3) If:

      * (a) any liabilities arise for the discharge of which a *life insurance company has *segregated exempt assets; or

      * (b) any expenses are incurred by a life insurance company directly in respect of segregated exempt assets in relation to a period during which the assets are segregated exempt assets;

##### 320255  Consequences of transfer of assets to or from segregated exempt assets

     * (1) This section applies if:

      * (a) an asset (other than money) is transferred from the company's *segregated exempt assets under subsection 320235(1) or 320250(1) or (2); or

      * (b) an asset (other than money) is transferred to the company's *segregated exempt assets under subsection 320235(3) or section 320240.

     * (2) In determining:

      * (a) for the purposes of this Act (other than Division 40 and Parts 31 and 33) whether an amount is included in, or can be deducted from, the assessable income of a *life insurance company in respect of the transfer of the asset; or

      * (b) for the purposes of Parts 31 and 33:

        * (i) whether the company made a *capital gain in respect of the transfer; or

        * (ii) whether the company made a *capital loss in respect of the transfer;

     * the company is taken: 

      * (c) to have sold, immediately before the transfer, the asset transferred for a consideration equal to its *market value; and

      * (d) to have purchased the asset again at the time of the transfer for a consideration equal to its market value.

     * (3) If, apart from this subsection, section 32060 and subsection 320105(1), a *life insurance company could deduct an amount or apply a *capital loss as a result of the transfer of an asset to its *segregated exempt assets, the deduction or capital loss is disregarded until:

      * (a) the asset ceases to exist; or

      * (b) the asset, or a greater than 50% interest in it, is *acquired by an entity other than an entity that is an *associate of the company, immediately after the acquisition.

     * (3A) Subsection (3) does not apply in relation to an amount that the company can deduct under a provision in Division 40.

     * (4) A *life insurance company cannot deduct an amount or apply a *capital loss as a result of the transfer of an asset from its *segregated exempt assets.

     * (6) If a *depreciating asset is transferred to the *segregated exempt assets of a *life insurance company, then, in determining for the purposes of Division 40 whether an amount is included in, or can be deducted from, the company's assessable income as a result of the transfer, the company is taken:

      * (a) to have, at the time immediately before the transfer, sold the asset for a consideration equal to its *market value at that time; and

      * (b) to have, at the time of the transfer, purchased the asset again for a consideration equal to its market value at that time.

     * (7) If a *depreciating asset that has been included in the *segregated exempt assets of a *life insurance company since the asset was acquired by the company or the initial segregation of those assets took place is transferred from those assets, then the company must assume for the purposes of Division 40 that:

      * (a) if the asset's *market value at the time of the transfer is greater than its *adjustable value at that time, the company:

        * (i) had, at the time immediately before the transfer, sold the asset for a consideration equal to its adjustable value at that time; and

        * (ii) had, at the time of the transfer, purchased the asset again for a consideration equal to its adjustable value at that time; or

      * (b) if the asset's market value at the time of the transfer is equal to or less than its adjustable value at that time, the company:

        * (i) had, at the time immediately before the transfer, sold the asset for a consideration equal to its market value at that time; and

        * (ii) had, at the time of the transfer, purchased the asset again for a consideration equal to its market value at that time.

     * (8) If a *depreciating asset that was previously transferred to the *segregated exempt assets of a *life insurance company is transferred from those assets, then, the company must assume, for the purposes of Division 40 that:

      * (a) if the asset's *market value at the time of its transfer from those assets is greater than its market value at the time when it was transferred to those assets, the company:

        * (i) had, at the time immediately before the transfer from those assets, sold the asset for a consideration equal to its market value at the time when it was transferred to those assets; and

        * (ii) had, at the time of the transfer from those assets, purchased the asset again for a consideration equal to its market value at the time when it was transferred to those assets; or

      * (b) if the asset's market value at the time of its transfer from those assets is equal to or less than its market value at the time when it was transferred to those assets, the company:

        * (i) had, at the time immediately before the transfer from those assets, sold the asset for a consideration equal to its market value at that time; and

        * (ii) had, at the time of the transfer from those assets, purchased the asset again for a consideration equal to its market value at that time.

     * (9) Division 40 has effect in relation to an asset covered by subsection (6), (7) or (8) as if:

      * (a) in relation to the sale of the asset that is taken to have occurred under that subsection:

        * (i) the sale were a *balancing adjustment event; and

        * (ii) the *termination value of the asset for that event were equal to the consideration for the sale under that subsection; and

        * (iii) the company had stopped *holding the asset at the time of the sale; and

      * (b) in relation to the purchase of the asset that is taken to have occurred under that subsection:

        * (i) the company had only begun to hold the asset after the purchase; and

        * (ii) the first element of the asset's *cost were equal to the consideration for the purchase under that subsection; and

        * (iii) the company had acquired the asset from an *associate of the company.

          * Note: This means that, amongst other things, as a result of the transfer:

           * the asset's cost for the purposes of working out a deduction under Division 40 is reset; and

           * the company's assessable income might be adjusted under section 40285 if the transfer is a transfer to the company's segregated exempt assets.

     * This Act applies to a payment of an entitlement under Part VC (Financial claims scheme for policyholders with insolvent general insurers) of the _Insurance Act 1973_ as if the payment were made by the insurer under the insurance policy concerned.

     * Disregard a capital gain or loss from:

##### Operative provisions

##### 32225  Payment of entitlement under financial claims scheme treated as payment from insurer

     * (1) This Act applies to you as if an amount paid to you, or applied for your benefit, to meet your entitlement under Part VC (Financial claims scheme for policyholders with insolvent general insurers) of the _Insurance Act 1973_ relating to a *general insurance policy issued by a *general insurance company had been paid to you by the company under the terms and conditions of the policy.

     * (2) To avoid doubt, subsection (1) does not affect the operation of Part 25 in Schedule 1 to the _Taxation Administration Act 1953_.

          * Note: Division 21 in Schedule 1 to the _Taxation Administration Act 1953_ contains special provisions about how Part 25 in that Schedule operates in relation to the meeting of entitlements under Part VC of the _Insurance Act 1973_.

##### 32230  Disposal of rights against insurer to APRA and meeting of financial claims scheme entitlement have no CGT effects

      * (b) your entitlement under Division 3 of Part VC of that Act is met.

          * Note 1: Section 62ZZL of the _Insurance Act 1973_ causes you to cease to be the owner, and APRA to become the owner, of rights against a general insurance company relating to a general insurance policy when your entitlement arises under Part VC of that Act in relation to the policy.

          * Note 2: Division 3 of Part VC of the _Insurance Act 1973_ entitles persons with valid claims based on general insurance policies issued by certain general insurance companies that have since become insolvent to be paid the amount of those claims by APRA.

##### 3285  What this Division is about

     * This Division explains the meaning of the terms **_small business entity_**, **_annual turnover_**, **_aggregated turnover_** and related concepts (Subdivision 328C).

     * If you are a small business entity, this Division allows you to change the way the income tax law applies to you in these ways:

          * (a) you can choose to put your depreciating assets into a general pool and treat the pool as a single asset (Subdivision 328D);

          * (b) you can choose not to account for annual changes in trading stock value that are not more than $5,000 (Subdivision 328E).

     * In usual circumstances, these changes will simplify the working out of your taxable income, and so reduce your compliance costs.

     * Partners in a partnership

     * (6) A person who is a partner in a partnership in an income year is not, in his or her capacity as a partner, a **_small business entity_** for the income year.

##### 328115  Meaning of aggregated turnover

     * (1) Your **_aggregated turnover_** for an income year is the sum of the relevant annual turnovers (see subsection (2)) excluding any amounts covered by subsection (3).

     * Business carried on for part of income year only

     * (5) If an entity does not carry on a *business for the whole of an income year, the entity's *annual turnover for the income year must be worked out using a reasonable estimate of what the entity's annual turnover for the income year would be if the entity carried on a business for the whole of the income year.

     * Regulations may provide for different calculation of annual turnover

     * (6) The regulations may provide that an entity's *annual turnover for an income year is to be calculated in a different way, but only so that it would be less than the amount worked out under this section.

          * Example: A partner in a partnership would not be an affiliate of another partner merely because the first partner acts, or could reasonably be expected to act, in accordance with the directions or wishes of the second partner, or in concert with the second partner, in relation to the affairs of the partnership.

          * Directors of the same company, or the company and a director of that company, would be in a similar position.

##### Subdivision 328D--Capital allowances for small business entities

##### Guide to Subdivision 328D

##### 328170  What this Subdivision is about

     * If you are a small business entity, you can choose to deduct amounts for most of your depreciating assets on a diminishing value basis using a pool that is treated as a single depreciating asset.

     * Broadly, the pool is made up of the costs of the depreciating assets that are allocated to it or, in some cases, a proportion of those costs.

     * The pool rate is 30%.

     * There is a deduction for assets whose cost is less than $1,000 in the income year in which you start to use the asset or have it installed ready for use.

     * This Subdivision sets out how to calculate the pool deductions, and also sets out the consequences of:

          * (a) disposal of depreciating assets; and

          * (b) not choosing to use this Subdivision for an income year after having chosen to do so for an earlier income year; and

          * (c) changing the business use of depreciating assets.

     * (1) You deduct the *taxable purpose proportion of the *adjustable value of a *depreciating asset for the income year in which you start to use the asset, or have it *installed ready for use, for a *taxable purpose if:

      * (a) you were a *small business entity for that year and the year in which you started to *hold it; and

      * (ab) you chose to use this Subdivision for each of those years; and

      * (b) the asset is a depreciating asset whose *cost as at the end of the income year in which you start to use it, or have it installed ready for use, for a taxable purpose is less than $1,000.

            * Note: This threshold is $20,000 for assets you first acquire between 12 May 2015 and 30 June 2017: see subsection 328180(4) of the _Income Tax (Transitional Provisions) Act 1997_.

     * (2) You can also deduct, for an income year for which you are a *small business entity and you choose to use this Subdivision, the *taxable purpose proportion of an amount included in the second element of the *cost of an asset for which you have deducted an amount under subsection (1) if:

      * (a) the amount so included is less than $1,000; and

            * Note: This threshold is $20,000 for costs included between 12 May 2015 and 30 June 2017: see subsection 328180(5) of the _Income Tax (Transitional Provisions) Act 1997_.

      * (b) you started to use the asset, or have it *installed ready for use, for a *taxable purpose during an earlier income year.

     * (3) An asset for which you have deducted an amount under this section is allocated to your *general small business pool if:

      * (a) an amount of $1,000 or more is included in the second element of the asset's *cost; or

            * Note: This threshold is $20,000 for costs included between 12 May 2015 and 30 June 2017: see subsection 328180(5) of the _Income Tax (Transitional Provisions) Act 1997_.

      * (b) any amount is included in the second element of the asset's cost and you have deducted or can deduct an amount under subsection (2) for an amount previously included in the second element of the asset's cost.

     * (4) This Division applies to the asset as if its *adjustable value were the amount included in the second element of its *cost as mentioned in subsection (3).

     * (5) Subsection (3) applies even if the amount is included in the second element of the asset's *cost during an income year for which you are not a *small business entity or do not choose to use this Subdivision.

##### 328185  Pooling

     * (1) If you are a *small business entity for an income year and you have chosen to use this Subdivision for that year, you deduct amounts for your *depreciating assets (except assets for which you have deducted or can deduct an amount under section 328180) through a pool, which allows you to deduct amounts for them as if they were a single asset, thereby simplifying your calculations. You use one rate for the pool.

     * (2) There is a **_general small business pool_** to which *depreciating assets are allocated.

     * Allocating assets to a pool

     * (3) A *depreciating asset:

      * (a) that you *hold just before, and at the start of, the first income year for which you are, or last were, a *small business entity; and

      * (b) for which you calculate your deductions under this Subdivision instead of under Division 40; and

      * (c) that has not previously been allocated to your *general small business pool; and

      * (d) that you have started to use, or have *installed ready for use, for a *taxable purpose;

     * is automatically allocated to your general small business pool.

     * (4) A *depreciating asset that you start to use, or have *installed ready for use, for a *taxable purpose during an income year for which you are a *small business entity and you choose to use this Subdivision is allocated to the *general small business pool at the end of that year.

          * Note: The allocation happens even if you no longer hold the asset at the end of that income year.

     * Exception for assets used or installed before 1 July 2001

     * (5) You can choose not to have a *depreciating asset allocated to the *general small business pool if you started to use it, or have it *installed ready for use, for a *taxable purpose before 1 July 2001.

          * Note: If you make this choice, you would continue to deduct amounts for the asset under Division 40.

     * (6) You must make that choice for the first income year for which you are a *small business entity and you choose to use this Subdivision. Once you have made the choice for an asset, you cannot change it.

     * No reallocation

     * (7) Once a *depreciating asset is allocated to your *general small business pool, it is not reallocated, even if you are not a *small business entity for a later income year or you do not choose to use this Subdivision for that later year.

          * Note: If you chose to use this Subdivision for an income year, you continue to use it for your general small business pool for a later income year even if you are not a small business entity, or do not choose to use this Subdivision, for the later year: see section 328220.

##### 328190  Calculation

     * (1) You calculate your deduction for your *general small business pool for an income year using this formula:

          * Note: You use section 328210 instead if the pool has a low pool value.

     * (2) Your deduction for each *depreciating asset that you start to use, or have *installed ready for use, for a *taxable purpose during an income year for which you are a *small business entity and choose to use this Subdivision is 15% of the *taxable purpose proportion of its *adjustable value.

     * (3) You can also deduct for an income year for which you are a *small business entity and choose to use this Subdivision the amount worked out under subsection (4) for an amount (the **_cost addition amount_**) included in the second element of the *cost of a *depreciating asset for that year if you started to use the asset, or have it *installed ready for use, for a *taxable purpose during an earlier income year.

          * Note: The second element of cost is worked out under section 40190.

     * (4) The amount you can deduct is 15% of the *taxable purpose proportion of the cost addition amount.

          * Note: The amounts that a transferor and transferee can deduct under this section are modified if rollover relief under section 40340 is chosen: see sections 328243 and 328247.

##### 328195  Opening pool balance

     * (1) For the first income year for which you are a *small business entity and choose to use this Subdivision, the **_opening pool balance_** of your *general small business pool is the sum of the *taxable purpose proportions of the *adjustable values of *depreciating assets allocated to the pool under subsection 328185(3).

     * (2) For a later income year, the **_opening pool balance_** of your *general small business pool is that pool's *closing pool balance for the previous income year, reduced or increased by any adjustment required under section 328225 (about change in the business use of an asset).

          * Note: You continue to deduct amounts using your general small business pool even if you are not a small business entity, or do not choose to use this Subdivision, for a later income year: see section 328220.

     * (3) However, if:

      * (a) you are not a *small business entity for an income year or you do not choose to use this Subdivision for that year; but

      * (b) you are a small business entity for a later income year and you choose to use this Subdivision for the later year;

     * the **_opening pool balance_** of your *general small business pool includes the sum of the *taxable purpose proportions of the *adjustable values of *depreciating assets allocated to the pool under subsection 328185(3) for that year.

##### 328200  Closing pool balance

     * You work out the **_closing pool balance_** of your *general small business pool for an income year in this way:

Method statement

        * Step 1.	Add to the *opening pool balance of the pool for the income year:

          * (a) the sum of the *taxable purpose proportions of the *adjustable values of *depreciating assets you started to use, or have *installed ready for use, for a *taxable purpose during the income year and that are allocated to the pool; and

          * (b) the taxable purpose proportion of any cost addition amounts (see subsection 328190(3)) for the income year for assets allocated to the pool.

        * Step 2.	Subtract from the step 1 amount:

          * (a) the *taxable purpose proportions of the *termination values of *depreciating assets allocated to the pool and for which a *balancing adjustment event occurred during the income year; and

          * (b) your deduction under subsection 328190(1) for the pool for the income year; and

          * (c) your deductions under subsection 328190(2) for *depreciating assets you started to use, or have *installed ready for use, for a *taxable purpose during the income year and that are allocated to the pool; and

          * (d) your deductions under subsection 328190(3) for the income year for cost addition amounts for assets allocated to the pool.

        * Step 3.	The result is the **_closing pool balance_** of the pool for the income year.

          * Note: A transferor does not subtract anything for certain balancing adjustment events under paragraph (a) of step 2 if rollover relief under section 40340 is chosen: see sections 328243 and 328245.

##### 328205  Estimate of taxable use

     * (1) You must, for the first income year for which you are, or last were, a *small business entity, make a reasonable estimate for that year of the proportion you will use, or have *installed ready for use, each *depreciating asset that you *held just before, and at the start of, that year for a *taxable purpose if:

      * (a) the asset has not previously been allocated to your *general small business pool; and

      * (b) you have started to use it, or have it installed ready for use, for a taxable purpose; and

      * (c) you have chosen to calculate your deductions for it under this Subdivision.

          * Note 1: That proportion will be 100% for an asset that you expect to use, or have installed ready for use, solely for a taxable purpose.

          * Note 2: Your estimate will be zero for an income year if another provision of this Act denies a deduction for that year: see section 328230.

          * Note 3: This subsection does not apply to a transferee for certain assets if rollover relief under section 40340 is chosen: see sections 328243 and 328257.

     * (2) You must also make this estimate for each *depreciating asset that you *hold and start to use, or have *installed ready for use, for a *taxable purpose during an income year for which you are a *small business entity and you choose to use this Subdivision. You must make the estimate for the income year in which you start to use it, or have it installed ready for use, for such a purpose.

     * (3) The **_taxable purpose proportion_** of a *depreciating asset's *adjustable value, or of an amount included in the second element of its *cost, is that part of that amount that represents:

      * (a) the proportion you estimated under subsection (1) or (2); or

      * (b) if you have had to make an adjustment under section 328225 for the asset--the proportion most recently applicable to the asset under that section.

          * Note: An amount included in the second element of the cost of a depreciating asset is referred to in this Division as a cost addition amount: see subsection 328190(3).

     * (4) The **_taxable purpose proportion_** of a *depreciating asset's *termination value is that part of that amount that represents:

      * (a) if you have not had to make an adjustment under section 328225 for the asset--the proportion you estimated under subsection (1) or (2); or

      * (b) if you have had to make at least one such adjustment--the average of:

        * (i) the proportion you estimated under subsection (1) or (2); and

        * (ii) the proportion applicable to the asset for each of the 3 income years you *held the asset after the one in which the asset was allocated to the pool.

          * Example: When Bria's computer was allocated to her general small business pool for the 201213 income year, she estimated that it would be used 50% for her florist business. Due to increasing business, Bria estimates the computer's use to be 70% for the 201314 year, and 90% for the 201415 year. She makes an adjustment under section 328225 for both those years.

          * Bria sells the computer for $1,000 at the start of the 201617 income year. She must now average the business use estimates for the computer for the year it was allocated to the pool and the next 3 years to work out the taxable purpose proportion of its termination value. The average is worked out as follows:

          * 50% (original estimate); plus

          * 70% (201314 estimate); plus

          * 90% (201415 estimate); plus

          * 90% (no change on previous year);

          * =300% ? 4 = 75%

          * The taxable purpose proportion of the computer's termination value is, therefore:

          * 75% of $1,000 = $750

##### 328210  Low pool value

     * (1) Your deduction for a *general small business pool for an income year is the amount worked out under subsection (2) (instead of an amount calculated under section 328190) if that amount is less than $1,000 but more than zero.

          * Note 1: See section 328215 for the result when the amount is less than zero.

          * Note 2: This threshold is $20,000 for income years ending on or after 12 May 2015 and on or before 30 June 2017: see subsection 328180(6) of the _Income Tax (Transitional Provisions) Act 1997_.

     * (2) The amount is the sum of:

      * (a) the pool's *opening pool balance for the income year; and

      * (b) the *taxable purpose proportion of the *adjustable value of each *depreciating asset you started to use, or have *installed ready for use, for a *taxable purpose during the income year and that is allocated to the pool; and

      * (c) the taxable purpose proportion of any cost addition amounts (see subsection 328190(3)) for the income year for assets allocated to the pool;

     * less the sum of the taxable purpose proportion of the *termination values of depreciating assets allocated to the pool and for which a *balancing adjustment event occurred during the income year.

     * (3) In that case, the *closing pool balance of the pool for that income year then becomes zero.

          * Example: Amanda's Graphics is a small business entity for the 201415 income year and chooses to use this Subdivision for that year. The business has an opening pool balance of $8,500 for its general small business pool for that year.

          * During that year, Amanda acquired a new computer for $2,000. The taxable purpose proportion of its adjustable value is:

          * $2,000 x 80% business use estimate = $1,600

          * Amanda also sold her business car for $9,600 during that year. The car was used 100% in the business.

          * To work out whether she can deduct an amount under this section, Amanda uses this calculation:

          * $8,500 + $1,600  $9,600 = $500

          * Because the result is less than $1,000, Amanda can deduct the $500 for the income year. The pool's closing balance for the year is zero.

##### 328215  Disposal etc. of depreciating assets

     * (1) This section sets out adjustments you may have to make if a *balancing adjustment event occurs for a *depreciating asset for which you calculate your deductions under this Subdivision.

     * (2) If the asset is allocated to your *general small business pool and:

      * (a) the *closing pool balance of the pool for the income year in which the event occurred is less than zero; or

      * (b) the amount worked out under subsection 328210(2) for that income year is less than zero;

     * the amount by which that balance or amount is less than zero is included in your assessable income for that year.

     * (3) In that case, the *closing pool balance of the pool for that income year then becomes zero.

     * (4) If the asset was one for which you deducted an amount under section 328180 (about assets costing less than $1,000), you include the *taxable purpose proportion of the asset's *termination value in your assessable income.

##### 328220  What happens if you are not a small business entity or do not choose to use this Subdivision for an income year

     * (1) If you are not a *small business entity for an income year or you do not choose to use this Subdivision for that year, this Subdivision continues to apply to your *general small business pool for that year and later income years.

     * (2) However, *depreciating assets you started to use, or have *installed ready for use, for a *taxable purpose during an income year for which you are not a *small business entity or do not choose to use this Subdivision cannot be allocated to your *general small business pool under this Subdivision until an income year for which you are a small business entity and you choose to use this Subdivision.

     * (3) This section applies to a transferee referred to in subsection 328243(1) or (1A) who:

      * (a) was not a *small business entity for the income year in which the relevant *balancing adjustment events occurred; or

      * (b) did not choose to use this Subdivision for that year;

     * as if the transferee had been a small business entity for an earlier income year and had chosen to use this Subdivision for the earlier year. This rule applies even if rollover relief is not chosen.

##### 328225  Change in business use

     * (1) You must, for each income year (the **_present year_**) after the year in which a *depreciating asset is allocated to a pool, make a reasonable estimate of the proportion you use the asset, or have it *installed ready for use, for a *taxable purpose in that year.

          * Note: This section is modified in its application to a transferee for certain assets if rollover relief under section 40340 is chosen: see sections 328243 and 328257.

     * (1A) You must make an adjustment for the present year if your estimate for that year under subsection (1) is different by more than 10 percentage points from:

      * (a) your original estimate (see section 328205); or

      * (b) if you have made an adjustment under this section--the most recent estimate you made under subsection (1) that resulted in an adjustment under this section.

     * (2) The adjustment is made to the *opening pool balance of the *general small business pool to which the asset was allocated, and it must be made before you calculate your deduction under this Subdivision for the present year.

          * Note: The opening pool balance will be reduced if the adjustment worked out under subsection (3) is a negative amount. It will be increased if the adjustment is positive.

     * (3) The adjustment is:

     * where: 

     * **_asset value_** is:

      * (a) for a *depreciating asset you started to use, or have *installed ready for use, for a *taxable purpose during an income year for which you were a *small business entity and chose to use this Subdivision--the asset's *adjustable value at that time; or

      * (b) for an asset you started to use, or have installed ready for use, for a taxable purpose during an income year for which you were not a *small business entity or did not choose to use this Subdivision--its adjustable value at the start of the income year for which it was allocated to a *general small business pool;

     * increased by any amounts included in the second element of the asset's *cost from the time mentioned in paragraph (a) or (b) until the beginning of the income year for which you are making the adjustment.

     * **_last estimate_** is:

      * (a) your original estimate of the proportion you use, or have *installed ready for use, a *depreciating asset for a *taxable purpose (see section 328205); or

      * (b) if you have made an adjustment under this section--the latest estimate taken into account under this section.

     * **_present year estimate_** is your reasonable estimate of the proportion you use the asset, or have it *installed ready for use, for a *taxable purpose during the present year.

     * **_reduction factor_** is the number worked out under subsection (4).

     * (4) The **_reduction factor_** in the formula in subsection (3) is:

      * (a) for a *depreciating asset you started to use, or have *installed ready for use, for a *taxable purpose during an income year for which you were a *small business entity and chose to use this Subdivision:

      * (b) for an asset you started to use, or have *installed ready for use, for a taxable purpose during an income year for which you were not a *small business entity or did not choose to use this Subdivision:

     * where: 

     * **_n_** is the number of income years (counting part of an income year as a whole year) before the present year for which you have deducted or can deduct an amount for the *depreciating asset under this Subdivision.

     * **_rate_** is the rate applicable to the pool to which the asset is allocated.

          * Note: The reduction factor for a depreciating asset in your general small business pool which you started to use, or have installed ready for use, for a taxable purpose during an income year for which you were not a small business entity or did not choose to use this Subdivision is:

             * 0.7 for the income year after it is allocated to the pool; and

             * 0.49 for the income year after that; and

             * 0.343 for the income year after that.

          * The reduction factor for a depreciating asset in your general small business pool which you started to use, or have installed ready for use, for a taxable purpose during an income year for which you were a small business entity and chose to use this Subdivision is:

             * 0.85 for the income year after it is allocated to the pool; and

             * 0.595 for the income year after that; and

             * 0.417 for the income year after that.

     * Exceptions

     * (5) However:

      * (a) you do not need to make an estimate or an adjustment under this section for a *depreciating asset for an income year that is at least 3 income years after the income year in which the asset was allocated; and

      * (b) you cannot make an adjustment for a depreciating asset if your reasonable estimate of the proportion you use a depreciating asset, or have it *installed ready for use, for a *taxable purpose changes in a later income year by the 10 percentage points mentioned in subsection (1) or less.

##### 328230  Estimate where deduction denied

     * This Subdivision applies to you as if you had estimated that you will not use, or have *installed ready for use, a *depreciating asset at all for a *taxable purpose during an income year if a provision of this Act outside this Division denies a deduction for the asset for that year.

##### 328235  Interaction with Divisions 85 and 86

     * (1) Despite sections 8510 and 8660, if you are a *small business entity for an income year you can deduct amounts for *depreciating assets under this Subdivision.

     * (2) However, you cannot deduct an amount for a *car under this Subdivision if, had you not been a *small business entity and chosen to use this Subdivision, sections 8660 and 8670 would have prevented you deducting an amount for it.

##### Special rules about rollovers

##### 328243  Rollover relief

     * (1A) There is rollover relief under subsection 40340(1) (as affected by subsection 40340(2)) if:

      * (a) *balancing adjustment events occur for *depreciating assets on a day (the **_BAE day_**) because an entity (the **_transferor_**) disposes of the assets in an income year to another entity (the **_transferee_**); and

      * (b) the disposal involves a *CGT event; and

      * (c) the conditions in item 1, 2 or 3 of the table in subsection 40340(1) are satisfied; and

      * (d) deductions for the assets are calculated under this Subdivision; and

      * (e) the transferor and the transferee jointly choose the rollover relief; and

      * (f) the condition in subsection (2) is met.

     * (1) Rollover relief can be chosen under subsection 40340(3) if:

      * (a) *balancing adjustment events occur for *depreciating assets on a day (the **_BAE day_**) because of subsection 40295(2); and

      * (b) deductions for the assets are calculated under this Subdivision; and

      * (c) the entity or entities that had an interest in the assets just before the balancing adjustment events occurred (the **_transferor_**) and the entity or entities that have an interest in the assets just after the events occurred (the **_transferee_**) jointly choose the rollover relief; and

      * (d) the condition in subsection (2) is met.

     * (2) All of the *depreciating assets that, just before the *balancing adjustment events occurred, were:

      * (a) *held by the transferor; and

      * (b) allocated to the transferor's *general small business pool;

     * must be held by the transferee just after those events occurred.

##### 328245  Consequences of rollover

     * (1) The transferor does not subtract anything for the *balancing adjustment events under:

      * (a) paragraph (a) of step 2 in the method statement in section 328200; or

      * (b) subsection 328210(2).

     * (2) Subsection 328215(4) does not apply to the *balancing adjustment events for the transferor.

     * (3) A choice made by the transferor for a *depreciating asset under subsection 328175(3) (about primary production assets) applies to the transferee as if it had been made by the transferee.

     * (4) Sections 328247 to 328257 have effect.

##### 328247  Pool deductions

     * (1) The amount that can be deducted for the transferor's *general small business pool for the income year (the **_BAE year_**) in which the *balancing adjustment events occurred under subsection 328190(1) or section 328210 for the BAE year is split equally between:

      * (a) the transferor and the transferee; or

      * (b) if there are 2 or more occurrences of balancing adjustment events for relevant entities for the BAE year and a rollover is chosen for each occurrence--the entities concerned.

          * Example: John and Dave operate a dry cleaning business in partnership (the transferor). The transferor is a small business entity for the relevant income year and has chosen to use this Subdivision for that year. On the 90th day of an income year, Jonathan joins the partnership. The new partnership (the transferee) is a small business entity for the income year and chooses to use this Subdivision for that year. Had there been no partnership change, a deduction of $6,600 would have been available for the transferor's general small business pool. The transferor and transferee jointly choose the rollover.

          * The deduction available to the transferor and the transferee for the pool under section 328210 is $3,300 each.

     * (2) The transferor cannot deduct any amount for the transferor's *general small business pool for an income year after the BAE year.

##### 328250  Deductions for assets first used in BAE year

     * (1) This section applies in working out the amount that the transferor or transferee can deduct for the BAE year under subsection 328180(1) (assets costing less than $1,000) or subsection 328190(2) (assets that will be pooled) for a *depreciating asset that the transferor or transferee started to use, or have *installed ready for use, for a *taxable purpose during the BAE year.

          * Note: The threshold in subsection 328180(1) is $20,000 (instead of $1,000) for assets first acquired between 12 May 2015 and 30 June 2017: see subsection 328180(4) of the _Income Tax (Transitional Provisions) Act 1997_.

     * Asset first used by transferor

     * (2) If the asset was first used or *installed ready for use by the transferor, the amount that can be deducted under subsection 328180(1) or 328190(2) for the asset for the BAE year is split equally between:

      * (a) the transferor and the transferee; or

      * (b) if there are 2 or more occurrences of *balancing adjustment events for relevant entities for the BAE year and a rollover is chosen for each occurrence--the entities concerned.

     * Asset first used by transferee

     * (3) If the asset was first used or *installed ready for use by the transferee:

      * (a) the transferor cannot deduct anything for the asset for the BAE year; and

      * (b) the amount that can be deducted under subsection 328180(1) or 328190(2) for the asset for the BAE year is:

        * (i) deductible by the transferee; or

        * (ii) if there are 2 or more occurrences of *balancing adjustment events for relevant entities for the BAE year and a rollover is chosen for each occurrence--split equally between the entities concerned (except ones that did not use the asset or have it installed ready for use).

          * Example: To continue the example from section 328247, the transferee buys an asset on the 150th day of the BAE year for $800.

          * On the 250th day of the year, Evan joins the transferee partnership. The new transferee partnership is a small business entity for the BAE year, and chooses to use this Subdivision for that year, and a further rollover is chosen.

          * The original transferor cannot deduct anything for the asset. The original transferee (now a transferor) and the new transferee can deduct $400 each.

     * Special rule for assets costing less than $1,000

     * (4) Subsection (5) applies if:

      * (a) the transferor started to use, or have *installed ready for use, an asset of a kind mentioned in paragraph 328180(1)(b) during the BAE year; and

      * (b) a *balancing adjustment event occurs for that asset before the BAE day.

          * Note: The threshold in subsection 328180(1) is $20,000 (instead of $1,000) for assets acquired between 12 May 2015 and 30 June 2017: see subsection 328180(4) of the _Income Tax (Transitional Provisions) Act 1997_.

     * (5) The transferee cannot deduct anything for the asset for the BAE year, and subsection 328215(4) does not apply to the transferee in relation to the asset.

##### 328253  Deductions for cost addition amounts

     * (1) This section applies in working out the amount that the transferor or transferee can deduct for the BAE year under subsection 328180(2) or 328190(3) for expenditure incurred by the transferor or transferee during the BAE year that is included in the second element of the *cost of a depreciating asset.

     * Expenditure incurred by transferor

     * (2) If the expenditure was incurred by the transferor, the amount that can be deducted under subsection 328180(2) or 328190(3) for the BAE year is split equally between:

      * (a) the transferor and the transferee; or

      * (b) if there are 2 or more occurrences of *balancing adjustment events for relevant entities for the BAE year and a rollover is chosen for each occurrence--the entities concerned.

     * Expenditure incurred by transferee

     * (3) If the expenditure was incurred by the transferee:

      * (a) the transferor cannot deduct anything for the expenditure for the BAE year; and

      * (b) the amount that can be deducted under subsection 328180(2) or 328190(3) for the expenditure for the BAE year is:

        * (i) deductible by the transferee; or

        * (ii) if there are 2 or more occurrences of *balancing adjustment events for relevant entities for the BAE year and a rollover is chosen for each occurrence--split equally between the entities concerned.

     * Special rule for expenditure on assets costing less than $1,000

     * (4) Subsection (5) applies if:

      * (a) the transferor incurred the expenditure in relation to an asset of a kind mentioned in paragraph 328180(1)(b); and

      * (b) a *balancing adjustment event occurs for that asset before the BAE day.

          * Note: The threshold in subsection 328180(1) is $20,000 (instead of $1,000) for assets first acquired between 12 May 2015 and 30 June 2017: see subsection 328180(4) of the _Income Tax (Transitional Provisions) Act 1997_.

     * (5) The transferee cannot deduct anything for the expenditure for the BAE year, and subsection 328215(4) does not apply to the transferee in relation to the asset.

##### 328255  Closing pool balance etc. below zero

     * (1) This section applies if:

      * (a) the *closing pool balance of the transferor's *general small business pool for the BAE year is less than zero; or

      * (b) the amount worked out under subsection 328210(2) for the pool for the BAE year is less than zero;

     * because a *balancing adjustment event occurred for an asset allocated to that pool during that year.

     * (2) The amount included in assessable income under subsection 328215(2) is split equally between:

      * (a) the transferor and transferee; or

      * (b) if there are 2 or more occurrences of *balancing adjustment events for relevant entities for the BAE year and a rollover is chosen for each occurrence--the entities concerned.

##### 328257  Taxable use

     * (1) This section applies to *depreciating assets (the **_previously held assets_**) that were *held by the transferor just before the *balancing adjustment events occurred.

     * (2) Subsection 328205(1) (about estimates of taxable use) does not apply to previously held assets in the hands of the transferee for the BAE year. Instead, the transferee uses for the BAE year:

      * (a) the estimate made by the transferor under that subsection for the asset; or

      * (b) if the transferor had made one or more estimates for the asset under subsection 328225(1) that resulted in an adjustment under section 328225 (about change in business use)--that estimate or the most recent of those estimates.

     * (3) Section 328225 applies to the transferee for each previously held asset for income years after the BAE year as if:

      * (a) the transferee had *held the asset during the period that the transferor held it; and

      * (b) estimates applicable to the transferor for the asset under that section were also applicable to the transferee.

##### Subdivision 328E--Trading stock for small business entities

##### Guide to Subdivision 328E

##### 328280  What this Subdivision is about

     * Small business entities can choose not to account for their trading stock in some circumstances. This Subdivision modifies the rules in Division 70 about trading stock for small business entities.

##### Table of sections

   * Operative provisions

       * 328285	Trading stock for small business entities

       * 328295	Value of trading stock on hand

##### Operative provisions

##### 328285  Trading stock for small business entities

     * You can choose not to account for changes in the *value of your *trading stock for an income year if:

      * (a) you are a *small business entity for that year; and

      * (b) the difference between the value of all your trading stock on hand at the start of that year and the value you reasonably estimate of all your trading stock on hand at the end of that year is not more than $5,000.

          * Note 1: As a result, sections 7035 and 7045 (about comparing the value of each item of trading stock on hand at the start and end of an income year) will not apply to you for the income year.

          * Note 2: When making a reasonable estimate of the value of trading stock on hand:

             * special valuation rules may be used, for example, obsolete stock, natural increase of livestock, horse breeding stock; and

             * the estimated value disregards an amount equal to the amount of input tax credits (if any) to which you would be entitled for an item if the acquisition of the item had been solely for a creditable purpose: see subsection 7045(1A).

          * Note 3: If you choose to account for changes in the value of your trading stock for an income year, you will have to do a stocktake and account for the change in the value of all your trading stock: see Subdivision 70C.

##### 328295  Value of trading stock on hand

     * (1) If you make a choice under section 328285 for an income year, the *value of all your *trading stock on hand at the start of the income year is:

      * (a) the same amount as was taken into account under this Act at the end of the previous income year; or

      * (b) zero if no item of trading stock was taken into account under this Act at the end of the previous income year.

          * Note: The amount taken into account at the end of the previous income year is worked out under either section 7045 or subsection (2) of this section.

     * (2) If you make a choice under section 328285 for an income year, this Act applies to you as if the *value of all your *trading stock on hand at the end of the year were equal to the value of all your trading stock on hand at the start of the year.

          * Note: If you do not make a choice under section 328285, the value of trading stock on hand at the end of the year is worked out using section 7045.

          * Example: Angela operates a riding school, and also sells riding gear. Her business is a small business entity for the 200809 income year and makes a choice under section 328285 for that year.

          * At the start of the 200809 income year, the opening value of Angela's trading stock is $30,000. Using her reliable inventory system, she estimates the closing value to be $34,000.

          * The closing value for the 200809 income year, and the opening value for the 200910 income year, will be $30,000.

     * (1) An *R&D entity is entitled to a *tax offset for an income year equal to the percentage, set out in the table, of the total of the amounts (if any) that the entity can deduct for the income year under any or all of the following provisions:

      * (a) section 355205 (R&D expenditure);

      * (b) section 355305 (decline in value of R&D assets);

      * (c) section 355315 (balancing adjustment for R&D assets);

      * (d) section 355480 (earlier year associate R&D expenditure);

      * (e) section 355520 (decline in value of R&D partnership assets);

      * (f) section 355525 (balancing adjustment for R&D partnership assets);

      * (g) section 355580 (CRC contributions).

          * Note: The tax offset will be a refundable tax offset if the percentage applicable to the entity is 45% (see section 6730).

     * If notional deductions are less than $20,000

     * (2) However, if the total of those amounts is less than $20,000, the *R&D entity is instead entitled to a *tax offset for the income year equal to that percentage of the total of the following kinds of expenditure (if any):

     * If notional deductions exceed $100 million

     * (3) Despite subsection (1), if the total of those amounts exceeds $100 million, the *R&D entity is instead entitled to a *tax offset for the income year equal to the sum of:

      * (a) that percentage of $100 million; and

      * (b) the product of the excess and the *corporate tax rate.

          * Note: The R&D entity may be able to reduce related amounts that would otherwise be:

            * (a) included in its assessable income because of a balancing, or feedstock, adjustment; or

            * (b) payable as extra income tax because of an R&D recoupment;

            * (see section 355720).

##### 355105  Deductions under this Division are notional only

     * An amount (the **_notional amount_**) that an *R&D entity can deduct under this Division is disregarded except for the purposes of:

      * (a) working out whether the R&D entity is entitled under section 355100 to a *tax offset; and

      * (b) a provision (of this Act or any other Act) that refers to an entitlement of the R&D entity under section 355100 to a tax offset; and

      * (c) a provision (of this Act or any other Act) that:

        * (i) prevents some or all of the notional amount from being deducted; or

        * (ii) changes the income year for which some or all of the notional amount can be deducted; and

            * Note: Examples are Divisions 26 and 27 of this Act, Subdivision H of Division 3 of Part III of the _Income Tax Assessment Act 1936_ and Part IVA of that Act.

      * (d) a provision (of this Act or any other Act) that includes an amount in assessable income wholly or partly because of the notional amount; and

            * Note: An example is Subdivision 20A, which may include in assessable income a recoupment of a loss or outgoing if the entity can deduct an amount for the loss or outgoing.

      * (e) a provision (of this Act or any other Act) that excludes expenditure from:

        * (i) the *cost base or *reduced cost base of a *CGT asset; or

        * (ii) an element of that cost base or reduced cost base.

            * Note: An example is section 11045, which may exclude deductible expenditure from elements of the cost base of an asset.

##### 355110  Notional deductions include prepaid expenditure

     * For the purposes of this Division, if:

      * (a) apart from Subdivision H (prepaid expenditure) of Division 3 of Part III of the _Income Tax Assessment Act 1936_, an *R&D entity can deduct an amount under section 355205 or 355480 for an income year (the **_present year_**) or an earlier income year; and

      * (b) that Subdivision applies to the calculation of that amount; and

      * (c) the entity can deduct an amount, as a result of that application of that Subdivision, for the present year;

     * the entity is taken to be able to deduct under section 355205 or 355480 (as appropriate) the amount referred to in paragraph (c) for the present year.

          * Note: Section 355205 is about deductions for R&D expenditure. Section 355480 is about deductions for earlier year associate R&D expenditure.

##### 355200  What this Subdivision is about

     * An R&D entity can notionally deduct its expenditure on registered R&D activities for which certain conditions are met.

     * There are special conditions for R&D activities conducted for foreign residents.

##### 355205  When notional deductions for R&D expenditure arise

     * (1) An *R&D entity can deduct for an income year (the **_present year_**) expenditure it incurs during that year to the extent that the expenditure:

      * (a) is incurred on one or more *R&D activities:

        * (i) for which the R&D entity is registered under section 27A of the _Industry Research and Development Act 1986_ for an income year; and

        * (ii) that are activities to which section 355210 (conditions for R&D activities) applies; and

      * (b) if the expenditure is incurred to the R&D entity's *associate--is paid to that associate during the present year.

          * Note 1: If the matters in subparagraphs (a)(i) and (ii) are not satisfied until a later income year, the R&D entity will need to wait until then before it can deduct the expenditure for the present year.

          * Note 2: The R&D activities will need to be conducted during the income year the R&D entity is registered for those activities (see sections 27A and 27J of the _Industry Research and Development Act 1986_).

          * Note 3: The entity may also be able to deduct expenditure incurred to an associate in an earlier income year (see section 355480).

          * Note 4: Expenditure incurred in income years starting on or after 1 July 2011 may be deductible for activities registered for income years starting before 1 July 2011 (see section 355200 of the _Income Tax (Transitional Provisions) Act 1997_).

     * (2) This section has effect subject to section 355225 (excluded expenditure), Subdivision 355F (integrity rules) and subsection 355580(3) (CRC contributions).

##### 355210  Conditions for R&D activities

     * (1) An *R&D activity covered by one or more of the following paragraphs is an activity to which this section applies:

      * (a) the R&D activity is conducted for the *R&D entity solely within Australia or an external Territory;

      * (b) if the R&D entity is a body corporate carrying on business through a permanent establishment (as described in subsection 35535(2))--the R&D activity is conducted:

        * (i) for the body corporate; but

        * (ii) not for the purposes of that permanent establishment;

      * and the conditions in section 355215 (activities conducted for a body corporate by its permanent establishment) are met for the R&D activity;

      * (c) the R&D activity is conducted for one or more foreign residents who are each:

        * (i) incorporated under a *foreign law; and

        * (ii) a resident of a foreign country for the purposes of an agreement of a kind described in subsection 35535(2);

      * and the conditions in section 355220 (activities conducted for a foreign entity) are met for the R&D activity;

      * (d) the R&D activity is:

        * (i) conducted for the R&D entity solely outside Australia and the external Territories; and

        * (ii) covered by a finding in force under paragraph 28C(1)(a) of the _Industry Research and Development Act 1986_;

      * (e) the R&D activity consists of several parts, with:

        * (i) some parts being conducted for the R&D entity solely within Australia or an external Territory; and

        * (ii) the other parts being conducted for the R&D entity outside Australia and the external Territories while covered by a finding in force under paragraph 28C(1)(a) of the _Industry Research and Development Act 1986_.

          * Note: An activity can be covered by a finding under paragraph 28C(1)(a) of the _Industry Research and Development Act 1986_ if the activity cannot be conducted in Australia or the external Territories.

     * (2) However, an *R&D activity is not an activity to which this section applies if the activity is conducted, to a significant extent, for one or more other entities not covered by any paragraph of subsection (1).

          * Note: An entity would not be covered by, for example, paragraph (1)(c) if the conditions in section 355220 were not met for the R&D activity in relation to that entity.

##### 355215  R&D activities conducted by a permanent establishment for other parts of the body corporate

     * For the purposes of paragraph 355210(1)(b), the conditions for an *R&D activity are as follows:

      * (a) the R&D activity is conducted solely within Australia or an external Territory;

      * (b) if the R&D activity is a *supporting R&D activity, each corresponding *core R&D activity must be:

        * (i) an activity conducted, or to be conducted, solely within Australia or an external Territory; and

        * (ii) an activity for which the *R&D entity is or has been registered under section 27A of the _Industry Research and Development Act 1986_, or could be registered for an income year if that core R&D activity were conducted during the income year;

      * (c) there is written evidence that the R&D activity is conducted for the body corporate but not for the purposes of that permanent establishment.

          * Note: The body corporate is the R&D entity to the extent that it carries on business through that permanent establishment (see subsection 35535(2)).

##### 355220  R&D activities conducted for a foreign entity

     * (1) For the purposes of paragraph 355210(1)(c), the conditions for an *R&D activity conducted for one or more foreign residents are as follows:

      * (a) the R&D activity is conducted solely within Australia or an external Territory;

      * (b) if the R&D activity is a *supporting R&D activity, each corresponding *core R&D activity must be:

        * (i) an activity conducted, or to be conducted, solely within Australia or an external Territory; and

        * (ii) an activity for which the *R&D entity is or has been registered under section 27A of the _Industry Research and Development Act 1986_, or could be registered for an income year if that core R&D activity were conducted during the income year;

      * (c) when the R&D activity is conducted:

        * (i) each foreign resident is *connected with the R&D entity; or

        * (ii) for each foreign resident--either the foreign resident is an *affiliate of the R&D entity or the R&D entity is an affiliate of the foreign resident;

      * (d) the R&D activity is conducted:

        * (i) in accordance with a written agreement binding on only the R&D entity and each foreign resident; and

        * (ii) either directly by the R&D entity, or indirectly by another entity under an agreement binding on the R&D entity;

      * (e) the R&D activity is not conducted in connection with an agreement covered by subsection (2).

          * Note: An example of conducting an R&D activity indirectly under a contract is conducting the R&D activity under a subcontract, or one of a chain of subcontracts, under the contract.

     * (2) An agreement is covered by this subsection if:

      * (a) the agreement is binding on the R&D entity (the **_first entity_**) and an R&D entity that:

        * (i) is *connected with the first entity; or

        * (ii) has the first entity as an *affiliate, or is an affiliate of the first entity;

      * while the *R&D activity is conducted; and

      * (b) the R&D activity is to be conducted under the agreement by the first entity or by an entity:

        * (i) who is not bound by the agreement; and

        * (ii) who is to conduct the R&D activity directly or indirectly under another agreement to which the first entity is, or will become, bound.

          * Note: One effect of this subsection is that, even if the R&D entity has an agreement with the foreign resident for conducting the R&D activity, the R&D entity cannot deduct expenditure incurred:

            * (a) for conducting the R&D activity as a subcontractor under a subcontract with an affiliated R&D entity; or

            * (b) if the R&D entity is a subcontractor to an affiliated R&D entity--for further subcontracting the conducting of the R&D activity.

##### 355225  Expenditure that cannot be notionally deducted

     * Expenditure on buildings, certain assets and interest

     * (1) Sections 355205 (deductions for R&D expenditure) and 355480 (deductions for earlier year associate R&D expenditure) do not apply to the following expenditure:

      * (a) expenditure incurred to acquire or construct:

        * (i) a building or a part of a building; or

        * (ii) an extension, alteration or improvement to a building;

      * (b) expenditure included in the *cost of a tangible *depreciating asset for the purposes of Division 40 (as that Division applies as described in section 355310 or otherwise);

      * (c) expenditure incurred for interest (within the meaning of Division 11A of Part III of the _Income Tax Assessment Act 1936_) payable to an entity.

          * Note 1: Expenditure covered by paragraph (a) may be deductible under Division 43 (capital works).

          * Note 2: The decline in value of an asset covered by paragraph (b) may be notionally deductible under section 355305.

          * Note 3: Expenditure covered by paragraph (c) may be deductible under section 81.

     * Expenditure on core technology

     * (2) Sections 355205 (deductions for R&D expenditure) and 355480 (deductions for earlier year associate R&D expenditure) do not apply to expenditure incurred in acquiring, or in acquiring the right to use, technology wholly or partly for the purposes of one or more *R&D activities if:

      * (a) a purpose of the R&D activities was or is:

        * (i) to obtain new knowledge based on that technology; or

        * (ii) to create new or improved materials, products, devices, processes, techniques or services to be based on that technology; or

      * (b) the R&D activities were or are an extension, continuation, development or completion of the activities that produced that technology.

##### Subdivision 355E--Notional deductions for decline in value of depreciating assets used for R&D activities

##### Table of sections

       * 355300	What this Subdivision is about

       * 355305	When notional deductions for decline in value arise

       * 355310	Notional application of Division 40

       * 355315	Balancing adjustments--assets only used for R&D activities

##### 355300  What this Subdivision is about

     * An R&D entity can notionally deduct the decline in value of a tangible depreciating asset used for R&D activities.

     * If a balancing adjustment event later happens for the asset, the R&D entity may be able to notionally deduct a further amount. Alternatively, an amount may be included in the R&D entity's assessable income.

##### 355305  When notional deductions for decline in value arise

     * (1) If:

      * (a) an *R&D entity is registered under section 27A of the _Industry Research and Development Act 1986_ for an income year (the **_present year_**) for one or more *R&D activities that are activities to which section 355210 (conditions for R&D activities) applies; and

      * (b) while a tangible *depreciating asset is *held by the R&D entity during the present year, the asset is used for the purpose of conducting one or more of those R&D activities; and

      * (c) the R&D entity could deduct an amount under section 4025 for the asset for the present year if Division 40 applied with the changes described in section 355310; and

      * (d) the R&D entity cannot deduct an amount for the asset for:

        * (i) an earlier income year under Subdivision 328D (capital allowances for small business entities); or

        * (ii) an earlier income year under Division 40 (as that Division applies apart from this Division), in a case where section 40440 (lowvalue pools) applied;

     * the R&D entity can deduct the amount referred to in paragraph (c) for the present year.

     * (2) This section has effect subject to subsection 355580(4) (CRC contributions).

##### 355310  Notional application of Division 40

     * (1) In addition to its application apart from this section, Division 40 also applies with the changes set out in this section for the purposes of:

      * (a) paragraph 355225(1)(b) (excluded expenditure); and

      * (b) paragraph 355305(1)(c); and

      * (c) section 355315 (balancing adjustments).

     * (2) Firstly, substitute the following for references to a *taxable purpose in Subdivisions 40A to 40D (other than for the purposes of sections 40100, 40105 and 40110):

          * Note: Sections 40100, 40105 and 40110 are about working out an asset's effective life. Those sections already refer to the use of the asset for R&D activities.

     * (3) Secondly, assume that Division 40 does not apply to a building, nor to an extension, alteration or improvement to a building, (the **_building works_**) for which the *R&D entity:

      * (a) can deduct amounts under Division 43 (capital works); or

      * (b) could deduct amounts under Division 43:

        * (i) apart from expenditure being incurred, or the building works being started, before a particular day; or

        * (ii) had the R&D entity used the building works for a purpose relevant to those building works under section 43140 (using an area in a deductible way).

     * (4) Finally, assume that the following provisions had not been enacted:

      * (a) subsection 4025(7) (meaning of taxable purpose);

      * (b) subsection 4045(2) (assets to which Division 40 does not apply);

      * (c) section 40425 (lowvalue pools);

      * (d) Subdivision 328D (capital allowances for small business entities).

          * Note: Subsection (3) and paragraph (4)(b) mean that deductions under section 355305 may be available for capital works other than building works.

##### 355315  Balancing adjustments--assets only used for R&D activities

     * (1) This section applies to an *R&D entity if:

      * (a) a *balancing adjustment event happens in an income year (the **_event year_**) for an asset *****held by the R&D entity; and

      * (b) the R&D entity cannot deduct an amount under section 4025, as that section applies apart from:

        * (i) this Division; and

        * (ii) former section 73BC of the _Income Tax Assessment Act 1936_;

      * for the asset for an income year; and

      * (c) the R&D entity is entitled under section 355100 to *tax offsets for one or more income years for deductions (the **_R&D deductions_**) under section 355305 for the asset; and

      * (d) the entity is registered under section 27A of the _Industry Research and Development Act 1986_ for one or more *R&D activities for the event year; and

      * (e) if Division 40 applied with the changes described in section 355310:

        * (i) the entity could deduct for the event year an amount under subsection 40285(2) for the asset and the balancing adjustment event; or

        * (ii) an amount would be included in the entity's assessable income for the event year under subsection 40285(1) for the asset and the balancing adjustment event.

          * Note 1: This section applies in a modified way if the entity also has deductions for the asset under former section 73BA or 73BH of the _Income Tax Assessment Act 1936_ (see section 355320 of the _Income Tax (Transitional Provisions) Act 1997_).

          * Note 2: Section 40292 applies if the entity can deduct an amount under section 4025, as that section applies apart from this Division and former section 73BC of the _Income Tax Assessment Act 1936_.

     * Notional deduction

     * (2) If the *R&D entity could deduct for the event year an amount under subsection 40285(2) for the asset and the event if Division 40 applied as described in paragraph (1)(e), the R&D entity can deduct that amount for the event year.

     * Amount to be included in assessable income

     * (3) If an amount (the **_section 40285 amount_**) would be included in the *R&D entity's assessable income for the event year under subsection 40285(1) for the asset and the event if Division 40 applied as described in paragraph (1)(e), the sum of that amount and the following amount is included in the R&D entity's assessable income for the event year:

     * where: 

     * **_adjusted section 40285 amount_** means so much of the section 40285 amount as does not exceed the total decline in value.

     * **_total decline in value_** means the asset's *cost, less its *adjustable value, worked out under Division 40 as it applies as described in paragraph (1)(e).

       * 355410	Disposal of R&D results

       * 355415	Reducing deductions to reflect markups within groups

##### 355400  Expenditure incurred while not at arm's length

     * If: 

      * (a) an *R&D entity incurs expenditure to another entity on all or part of an *R&D activity; and

      * (b) either:

        * (i) when the R&D entity incurs the expenditure, the R&D entity and the other entity do not deal with each other at *arm's length; or

        * (ii) the other entity is the R&D entity's *associate; and

      * (c) the expenditure exceeds the *market value of the relevant R&D activity or part (as appropriate);

     * for the purposes of this Division, the R&D entity is treated as if the amount of expenditure it incurred on the relevant R&D activity or part (as appropriate) were equal to that market value.

          * Note: For the purposes of a deduction under section 355305 or 355520 for an asset's decline in value, the arm's length rules in Division 40 apply as part of the notional application of that Division under that section.

##### 355405  Expenditure not at risk

     * (1) An *R&D entity cannot deduct expenditure under section 355205 or 355480 if:

      * (a) when it incurs the expenditure, the R&D entity or its *associate had received, or could reasonably be expected to receive, consideration:

        * (i) as a direct or indirect result of the expenditure being incurred; and

        * (ii) regardless of the results of the activities on which the expenditure is incurred; and

      * (b) that consideration is equal to or greater than the expenditure.

          * Note: Section 355205 is about deductions for R&D expenditure. Section 355480 is about deductions for earlier year associate R&D expenditure.

     * (2) If:

      * (a) when an *R&D entity incurs expenditure, the R&D entity or its *associate had received, or could reasonably be expected to receive, consideration:

        * (i) as a direct or indirect result of the expenditure being incurred; and

        * (ii) regardless of the results of the activities on which the expenditure is incurred; and

      * (b) that consideration is less than the expenditure;

     * the R&D entity cannot deduct under section 355205 or 355480 so much of the expenditure as is equal to the consideration.

     * (3) For the purposes of paragraphs (1)(a) and (2)(a), have regard to:

      * (a) anything that happened or existed before or at the time the expenditure is incurred; and

      * (b) anything that is likely to happen or exist after that time.

     * (4) This section does not apply to expenditure incurred on *R&D activities covered by paragraph 355210(1)(b) or (c).

          * Note: Those paragraphs cover R&D activities conducted for foreign residents.

##### 355410  Disposal of R&D results

     * (1) This section applies to an *R&D entity if:

      * (a) the R&D entity is entitled under section 355100 to a *tax offset because it can:

        * (i) deduct under section 355205 or 355480 expenditure incurred on *R&D activities; or

        * (ii) deduct under section 355305 or 355520 an amount for an asset (the **_R&D asset_**) used for the purpose of conducting one or more R&D activities; and

      * (b) the R&D entity receives or becomes entitled to receive one or more of the following amounts (the **_results amounts_**) in an income year (the **_results year_**):

        * (i) an amount for the results of any of the R&D activities;

        * (ii) an amount from granting access to, or the right to use, any of those results;

        * (iii) an amount attributable to the R&D entity having incurred the expenditure, including an amount it is entitled to receive regardless of the results of the R&D activities;

        * (iv) an amount attributable to the R&D asset being used for the purpose mentioned in subparagraph (a)(ii), including an amount the R&D entity is entitled to receive regardless of the results of the R&D activities;

        * (v) an amount from *disposing of a *CGT asset, or from granting a right to occupy or use a CGT asset, where the disposal or grant resulted in another person acquiring a right to access or use any of those results.

          * Note: This section also applies with changes to the partners of an R&D partnership (see section 355535).

     * (2) For each results amount, the following amount is included in the *R&D entity's assessable income for the results year:

      * (a) if the results amount is only a results amount because of subparagraph (1)(b)(v), and the asset referred to in that subparagraph is a *depreciating asset--an amount equal to the extent (if any) that the results amount exceeds the asset's *cost just before the disposal or grant;

      * (b) if the results amount is only a results amount because of subparagraph (1)(b)(v), and the asset referred to in that subparagraph is not a depreciating asset--an amount equal to the extent (if any) that the results amount exceeds the asset's *cost base just before the disposal or grant;

      * (c) otherwise--the results amount.

     * (3) For the purposes of paragraph (2)(a), assume that subsection 4045(2) did not, except in the case of buildings and extensions, alterations and improvements to buildings, prevent Division 40 from applying to certain capital works.

##### 355415  Reducing deductions to reflect markups within groups

     * (1) This section applies to an *R&D entity if:

      * (a) the R&D entity can deduct an amount under section 355205 or 355480 for an income year for one or more *R&D activities; and

      * (b) one or more other entities (the **_grouped entities_**) incurred expenditure during the income year, or an earlier income year, on one or more of those *R&D activities; and

      * (c) when each grouped entity incurred the expenditure:

        * (i) the grouped entity was *connected with the R&D entity; or

        * (ii) the grouped entity was an *affiliate of the R&D entity or the R&D entity was an affiliate of the grouped entity.

          * Note: Section 355205 is about deductions for R&D expenditure. Section 355480 is about deductions for earlier year associate R&D expenditure.

     * Reducing deductions by group markups

     * (2) The amount the *R&D entity can deduct, apart from this section, under section 355205 or 355480 for the income year is reduced by the amount (the **_reduction amount_**) worked out as follows:

Method statement

        * Step 1.	For each grouped entity, work out the sum of the amounts derived during the income year, or an earlier income year, by the grouped entity for goods or services relating to one or more of the *R&D activities while:

          * (a) the grouped entity was *connected with the *R&D entity; or

          * (b) the grouped entity was an *affiliate of the R&D entity or the R&D entity was an affiliate of the grouped entity.

        * Step 2.	From the sum of those amounts, subtract the actual cost to each grouped entity of providing the goods or services that correspond to those amounts.

     * If R&D entity has deductions for both R&D expenditure and earlier year associate R&D expenditure

     * (3) However, if the *R&D entity can deduct amounts under both sections 355205 and 355480 for the income year, those amounts are reduced as follows:

      * (a) apply the reduction amount to reduce the amount otherwise deductible under section 355205 (but not below zero); and

      * (b) then apply any remainder of the reduction amount to reduce the amount otherwise deductible under section 355480 (but not below zero).

     * Disregard markups already taken into account

     * (4) For the purposes of step 1 of the method statement in subsection (2), disregard any of the amounts from that step that have already been taken into account under this section for the *R&D entity and the *R&D activities for an earlier income year.

##### 355480  Notional deductions for expenditure incurred to associate in earlier income years

     * Notional deductions for earlier year associate expenditure

     * (1) An *R&D entity can deduct for an income year (the **_present year_**) expenditure it incurred to its *associate during an earlier income year to the extent that:

      * (a) the expenditure was incurred on one or more *R&D activities:

        * (i) for which the R&D entity is registered under section 27A of the _Industry Research and Development Act 1986_ for an income year; and

        * (ii) that are activities to which section 355210 (conditions for R&D activities) applies; and

      * (b) the expenditure is paid to that associate during the present year; and

      * (c) subsection (2) applies to the expenditure.

          * Note 1: This section applies in a modified way to R&D partnership expenditure (see sections 355510 and 355515).

          * Note 2: Expenditure paid in income years starting on or after 1 July 2011 may be deductible for activities registered for income years starting before 1 July 2011 (see section 355200 of the _Income Tax (Transitional Provisions) Act 1997_).

     * Expenditure cannot have been otherwise deducted etc.

     * (2) This subsection applies to the expenditure if:

        * (i) deducted the expenditure; nor

        * (ii) obtained a tax offset for the expenditure;

      * as described in paragraph (a).

     * (3) The entitlement to the deduction, or *tax offset, described in paragraph (2)(a) ceases to the extent that subsection (2) applies to the expenditure.

          * Example: If, by the time mentioned in paragraph (2)(b), an R&D entity chose to deduct only a third of the expenditure it could have deducted under another Division, then the remaining 2 thirds of that expenditure:

            * (a) can be deducted under this section; but

            * (b) can no longer be deducted under the other Division.

     * Notional deduction is subject to integrity rules etc.

      * (b) neither the R&D partnership, nor any other partner of the R&D partnership, incurred expenditure during the income year on the R&D activities; and

      * (c) such other changes were made to this Division as are appropriate having regard to that partner's proportion of amounts attributable to the R&D partnership.

          * Note: This section and section 355515 may result in:

            * (a) the partner being able to deduct the partner's proportion of the partnership expenditure under section 355205 (R&D expenditure) or 355480 (earlier year associate R&D expenditure) for the R&D activities; and

##### 355515  R&D activities conducted by or for an R&D partnership

     * If one or more *R&D activities are conducted by or for an *R&D partnership during an income year, this Division applies in relation to each *R&D entity that is a partner of the R&D partnership at some time during the income year as if:

      * (a) the R&D activities were conducted by or for the partner in a corresponding way to the way the R&D activities were conducted by or for the R&D partnership; and

      * (b) the partner had relationships with other entities in relation to the R&D activities that corresponded to the relationships the R&D partnership had with those other entities in relation to the R&D activities; and

      * (c) a thing done by, or in relation to, the R&D partnership in relation to the R&D activities were a thing done by, or in relation to, the partner; and

      * (d) the R&D activities were neither:

        * (i) conducted by or for the R&D partnership; nor

        * (ii) conducted by or for any other partner of the R&D partnership; and

      * (e) such other changes were made to this Division as are appropriate having regard to that partner's proportion of amounts attributable to the R&D partnership.

          * Note 1: For the purposes of this Division, entities that are associates or affiliates of, or connected with, the R&D partnership are taken to be associates or affiliates of, or connected with, the partner (see paragraph (b)).

          * Note 2: For the purposes of this Division, payments and agreements made by the R&D partnership for the R&D activities are taken to be made by the partner (see paragraph (c)).

##### 355520  When notional deductions arise for decline in value of depreciating assets of R&D partnerships

     * When notional deductions arise

     * (1) If:

      * (a) an *R&D entity is a partner of an *R&D partnership at some time during an income year (the **_present year_**); and

      * (b) the partner is registered under section 27A of the _Industry Research and Development Act 1986 _for the present year for one or more *R&D activities that are activities to which section 355210 (conditions for R&D activities) applies; and

      * (e) the R&D partnership cannot deduct an amount for the asset for:

        * (i) an earlier income year under Subdivision 328D (capital allowances for small business entities); or

     * the partner can deduct the partner's proportion of the amount referred to in paragraph (d) for the present year.

     * Changed application of Division 40 for this Subdivision

     * (2) For the purposes of this Subdivision, section 355310 applies as if the following changes were made:

      * (a) a *balancing adjustment event happens in an income year (the **_event year_**) for an asset *****held by an *R&D partnership; and

      * (b) the R&D partnership cannot deduct an amount under section 4025, as that section applies apart from:

        * (i) this Division; and

      * for the asset for an income year; and

      * (c) the partner is entitled under section 355100 to *tax offsets for one or more income years for deductions (the **_R&D deductions_**) under section 355520 for the asset; and

      * (d) the partner is registered under section 27A of the _Industry Research and Development Act 1986_ for one or more *R&D activities for the event year; and

      * (e) if Division 40 applied with the changes described in section 355310 (as affected by subsection 355520(2)):

        * (i) the R&D partnership could deduct for the event year an amount under subsection 40285(2) for the asset and the balancing adjustment event; or

        * (ii) an amount would be included in the R&D partnership's assessable income for the event year under subsection 40285(1) for the asset and the balancing adjustment event.

          * Note 1: This section applies in a modified way if the partner has deductions for the asset under former section 73BA or 73BH of the _Income Tax Assessment Act 1936_ (see section 355325 of the _Income Tax (Transitional Provisions) Act 1997_).

          * Note 2: Section 40293 applies if the R&D partnership can deduct an amount under section 4025, as that section applies apart from this Division and former section 73BC of the _Income Tax Assessment Act 1936_.

     * Notional deduction

     * (2) If the *R&D partnership could deduct for the event year an amount under subsection 40285(2) for the asset and the event if Division 40 applied as described in paragraph (1)(e), the partner can deduct the partner's proportion of that amount for the event year.

     * Amount to be included in assessable income

     * (3) If an amount (the **_section 40285 amount_**) would be included in the *R&D partnership's assessable income for the event year under subsection 40285(1) for the asset and the event if Division 40 applied as described in paragraph (1)(e), the partner's proportion of the sum of:

      * (a) that amount; and

      * (b) the following amount;

     * is included in the partner's assessable income for the event year:

     * where: 

     * **_adjusted section 40285 amount_** means so much of the section 40285 amount as does not exceed the total decline in value.

     * **_total decline in value_** means the asset's *cost, less its *adjustable value, worked out under Division 40 as it applies as described in paragraph (1)(e).

     * Amount to be included in assessable income may be reduced if notional deductions exceeded $100 million

     * (4) For the purposes of subsection (3), the partner may choose to reduce the adjusted section 40285 amount in that subsection if:

      * (a) subsection 355100(3) applied to the partner for an earlier income year or the event year (the **_excess year_**); and

      * (b) the partner's deductions for the excess year included deductions covered by paragraph (1)(c) of this section for the asset.

     * (5) Subsection 355720(3) applies to the partner as if a reduction under subsection (2) of that section for the present year included a reduction under subsection (4) of this section for the event year.

     * (6) The way the partner prepares its income tax returns is sufficient evidence of the making of a choice under subsection (4).

     * (7) A choice under subsection (4) is irrevocable.

##### 355530  Implications for partner's aggregated turnover

     * For the purposes of sections 40292 (balancing adjustments for decline in value) and 355100 (tax offsets for R&D), if:

      * (a) an *R&D entity is a partner of an *R&D partnership at some time during an income year; and

      * (b) the partner's *aggregated turnover for the income year does not include the R&D partnership's *annual turnover for the income year;

     * the partner's aggregated turnover for the income year includes the *partner's proportion of the R&D partnership's annual turnover for the income year.

##### 355535  Disposal of R&D results for R&D partnerships

     * In addition to its application apart from this section, section 355410 (disposal of R&D results) also applies to each partner of an *R&D partnership with such changes as are appropriate having regard to:

      * (a) amounts (the **_results amounts_**) of a kind set out in subparagraphs 355410(1)(b)(i) to (v) that the R&D partnership receives or becomes entitled to receive in an income year; and

      * (b) the principle that any amount to be included in the partner's assessable income for the income year for a results amount should be the partner's proportion of the amount arising under subsection 355410(2) for the results amount.

          * Note: The ordinary application of section 355410 will apply to any of the partner's deductions under this Division that do not relate to the R&D partnership.

##### 355540  Application of recoupment rules

     * (1) If:

      * (a) an *R&D partnership incurs expenditure (the **_partnership expenditure_**) on *R&D activities; and

      * (b) an *R&D entity (the **_partner_**) is entitled under section 355100 to a *tax offset because it can, under section 355205 or 355480, deduct some or all of that expenditure; and

      * (c) the R&D partnership receives an amount as a *recoupment of any or all of the partnership expenditure;

      * (e) to have received the partner's proportion of the recoupment when the R&D partnership received the recoupment.

     * (2) If:

      * (a) an *R&D entity (the **_partner_**) is entitled under section 355100 to a *tax offset because it can, under section 355520, deduct an amount for an income year for an asset; and

      * (b) the applicable *R&D partnership receives an amount as a *recoupment of any or all of the R&D partnership's expenditure included in the *cost of the asset for the purposes of the application of Division 40 as described in paragraph 355520(1)(d);

     * the partner is taken, for the purposes of Subdivisions 20A and 355G:

      * (c) to have incurred the partner's proportion of that expenditure when the R&D partnership incurred that expenditure; and

      * (d) to have received the partner's proportion of the recoupment when the R&D partnership received the recoupment.

##### 355545  Relevance for net income, and losses, of the R&D partnership

       * 355580	When notional deductions for CRC contributions arise

##### 355580  When notional deductions for CRC contributions arise

     * Monetary contributions are deductible

     * (1) An *R&D entity can deduct for an income year expenditure it incurs during that year to the extent that:

      * (a) the expenditure is in the form of monetary contributions under the *CRC program; and

      * (b) the contributions have been or will be spent under the CRC program on one or more *R&D activities for which the R&D entity is registered under section 27A of the _Industry Research and Development Act 1986_ for an income year.

          * Note 1: The R&D activities will need to be conducted during the income year the R&D entity is registered for those activities (see sections 27A and 27J of the _Industry Research and Development Act 1986_).

          * Note 2: Expenditure incurred in income years starting on or after 1 July 2011 may be deductible for activities registered for income years starting before 1 July 2011 (see section 355200 of the _Income Tax (Transitional Provisions) Act 1997_).

     * (2) Subsection (1) does not apply to expenditure to the extent that it is incurred out of Commonwealth funding.

     * No other deductions arise for monetary contributions etc.

     * (3) Neither:

      * (a) a contribution an *R&D entity can deduct under subsection (1); nor

      * (b) expenditure incurred under the *CRC program, to the extent that the expenditure is incurred out of:

        * (i) a contribution an R&D entity can deduct under subsection (1); or

        * (ii) Commonwealth funding;

     * can be deducted by any R&D entity under any other provision of this Division for any income year.

##### 355705  Effect of findings by Innovation Australia

     * Findings about registration or core technology

     * (1) If:

      * (a) a certificate given to the Commissioner under the _Industry Research and Development Act 1986_ sets out:

        * (i) a finding under section 27B of that Act about an *R&D entity's application for registration under section 27A of that Act for an income year; or

        * (ii) a finding under section 27J of that Act about an R&D entity's registration under section 27A of that Act for an income year; or

        * (iii) a finding under section 28E of that Act about an R&D entity and one or more *R&D activities conducted or to be conducted during one or more income years; and

      * (b) the finding was made within 4 years after the end of the income year or the last of the income years (as appropriate);

     * the finding binds the Commissioner for the purposes of assessments of the R&D entity for the income year or years (as appropriate).

          * Note: Section 28E of the _Industry Research and Development Act 1986_ deals with findings that technology is core technology for particular R&D activities. Expenditure incurred in acquiring such technology is not deductible under this Division (see subsection 355225(2)).

     * Advance findings about activities yet to be completed

     * (2) If:

      * (a) an activity is being conducted, or is yet to be conducted, in an income year; and

      * (b) an *R&D entity applies in the income year for a finding under section 28A of the _Industry Research and Development Act 1986_ about the activity; and

      * (c) Innovation Australia makes the finding and gives the Commissioner a certificate under that Act setting out the finding;

     * the finding binds the Commissioner for the purposes of assessments of the R&D entity for the income year and the next 2 income years.

     * Advance findings about completed activities

     * (3) However, if:

      * (a) an activity is completed during an income year; and

      * (b) an *R&D entity applies in the income year for a finding under section 28A of the _Industry Research and Development Act 1986_ about the activity; and

      * (c) Innovation Australia makes the finding and gives the Commissioner a certificate under that Act setting out the finding;

     * the finding binds the Commissioner for the purposes of assessments of the R&D entity for the income year.

##### 355710  Amendment of assessments

     * Dealing with findings of Innovation Australia

     * (1) If:

      * (a) a certificate given to the Commissioner under the _Industry Research and Development Act 1986_ sets out:

        * (i) a finding under section 27B of that Act about an *R&D entity's application for registration under section 27A of that Act for an income year; or

        * (ii) a finding under section 27J of that Act about an R&D entity's registration under section 27A of that Act for an income year; or

        * (iii) a finding under section 28A or 28C of that Act made on application by an R&D entity during an income year; or

        * (iv) a finding under section 28E of that Act about an R&D entity and one or more R&D activities conducted or to be conducted during one or more income years; and

      * (b) the finding was made within 4 years after the end of the income year or the last of the income years (as appropriate);

     * despite section 170 of the _Income Tax Assessment Act 1936_, the Commissioner may amend the R&D entity's assessment for an income year affected by the finding at any time for the purposes of giving effect to the finding.

     * (2) However, the Commissioner may only do so within 2 years after the Commissioner is given the certificate if giving effect to the finding would increase the R&D entity's liability.

     * Dealing with key decisions of Innovation Australia and others

     * (3) If:

      * (a) an internal review decision (the **_key decision_**) under subsection 30D(2) of the _Industry Research and Development Act 1986_ relates to an *R&D entity; or

      * (b) a decision (also the **_key decision_**) under the _Administrative Appeals Tribunal Act 1975_:

        * (i) varies a decision covered by paragraph (a); or

        * (ii) sets aside a decision covered by paragraph (a), whether or not that key decision also includes a decision made in substitution for the decision covered by paragraph (a); or

      * (c) a decision (also the **_key decision_**) of a court is about:

        * (i) a decision under Part III of the _Industry Research and Development Act 1986_ relating to an R&D entity; or

        * (ii) a decision covered by paragraph (b);

     * despite section 170 of the _Income Tax Assessment Act 1936_, the Commissioner may amend the R&D entity's assessment for an income year affected by the key decision at any time for the purposes of giving effect to that decision.

##### 355715  Implications for other deductions and tax offsets

     * (1) If an *R&D entity is entitled under section 355100 to a *tax offset for an income year for expenditure it can deduct under section 355205, 355480 or 355580, that expenditure:

      * (a) cannot be taken into account by any entity in working out a deduction under any other Division of this Act for any income year; and

      * (b) cannot be taken into account by any entity in working out a tax offset under any other Division of this Act for any income year.

          * Note: Section 355205 is about R&D expenditure, section 355480 is about earlier year associate R&D expenditure, and section 355580 is about CRC contributions.

     * (2) If an *R&D entity is entitled under section 355100 to a *tax offset for an income year for a deduction under section 355305, 355315, 355520 or 355525 of an amount equal to the decline in value of an asset, that decline in value:

      * (a) cannot be taken into account by any entity in working out a deduction under any other Division of this Act (other than section 40292 or 40293) for any income year; and

      * (b) cannot be taken into account by any entity in working out a tax offset under any other Division of this Act for any income year;

     * to the extent that the decline in value is attributable to the use of the asset for the purpose of conducting one or more of the *R&D activities to which the deduction relates.

          * Note 1: A deduction may be available under section 4025 to the extent that the asset's decline in value is attributable to another purpose. If so, that deduction under section 4025 will not take into account the asset's decline in value to the extent that it is attributable to the R&D activities (see also subsection 4025(2)).

          * Note 2: Section 355305 is about the decline in value of R&D assets, section 355315 is about balancing adjustments for R&D assets, section 355520 is about the decline in value of R&D partnership assets, and section 355525 is about balancing adjustments for R&D partnership assets.

          * Note 3: Sections 40292 and 40293 deal with balancing adjustments when deductions have been available for the asset's decline in value both under this Division and section 4025.

##### 355720  Certain related amounts may be reduced if notional deductions exceeded $100 million

     * (1) The object of this section is to prevent the portion of a *tax offset worked out using the *corporate tax rate being clawed back in later income years.

          * Note: This applies when the R&D entity's notional deductions exceed $100 million (see subsection 355100(3)).

     * (2) For the purposes of working out a matter referred to in column 1 of an item of this table for an income year (the **_present year_**), the *R&D entity may choose to reduce the amount referred to in column 3 of that item if:

      * (a) subsection 355100(3) applied to the R&D entity for an earlier income year or the present year (the **_excess year_**); and

      * (b) the R&D entity's deductions for the excess year included deductions covered by a provision referred to in column 2 of that item.

          * Note 1: Item 2 is about R&D recoupments and item 3 is about feedstock adjustments.

          * Note 2: Reducing the amount in column 3 will reduce the amount in column 1.

     * (3) The *R&D entity's circumstances may allow it to choose multiple reductions under subsection (2) for the present year. The total of any reductions cannot be more than the amount of its excess under subsection 355100(3) for the excess year.

     * (4) The way an *R&D entity prepares its income tax returns is sufficient evidence of the making of a choice under this section.

     * (5) A choice under this section is irrevocable.

##### 355750  Review of rate when notional deductions exceed $100 million

     * (1) The Minister must cause a review of the operation of subsection 355100(3) (about the rate of tax offset when notional deductions exceed $100 million) to be undertaken as soon as possible after the fifth anniversary of the commencement of that subsection.

     * (2) The Minister must cause a copy of the report of the review to be tabled in each House of the Parliament within 15 sitting days of receiving it.

##### 3761  What this Division is about

     * Companies may be entitled to 1 of 3 refundable tax offsets in relation to Australian expenditure incurred in making films. The offsets are designed to support and develop the Australian screen media industry by providing concessional tax treatment for Australian expenditure.

##### Table of sections

       * 3762	Key features of the tax offsets for Australian production expenditure on films

       * 3765	Structure of this Division

##### 3762  Key features of the tax offsets for Australian production expenditure on films

     * (1) The 3 tax offsets are:

      * (a) a refundable tax offset for Australian expenditure in making an Australian film (the producer offset); and

      * (b) a refundable tax offset for Australian expenditure in making any film (the location offset); and

      * (c) a refundable tax offset for Australian expenditure on post, digital and visual effects production for any film (the PDV offset).

     * (2) A company is only entitled to one of these offsets in relation to a film.

     * (3) The amount of the offset is determined as a percentage of certain Australian expenditure incurred by a company in producing the film:

      * (a) the amount of the producer offset is 40% of the company's qualifying Australian production expenditure on the film if the film is a feature film, and 20% of such expenditure if the film is not a feature film; and

      * (b) the amount of the location offset is 16.5% of the company's qualifying Australian production expenditure on the film; and

      * (c) the amount of the PDV offset is 30% of the company's qualifying Australian production expenditure on the film that relates to post, digital and visual effects production for the film.

     * (4) One of the requirements for entitlement to these offsets is that a company must be issued with a certificate for the film. The certificate will state the amount of Australian expenditure on which the offset will be determined.

     * (5) The offset is claimed by a company in its income tax return.

##### 3765  Structure of this Division

     * (1) Subdivision 376B tells you about the different tax offsets available for films, who can get each offset and what conditions must be met to get each offset. It also tells you how to work out the amount of each offset.

     * (2) Subdivision 376C explains what is meant by:

      * (a) production expenditure on a film; and

      * (b) qualifying Australian production expenditure on a film.

     * It also contains some rules for quantifying expenditure.

     * (3) Subdivision 376D deals with a number of administrative matters:

      * (a) applying for a certificate for a film; and

      * (b) the issue and revocation of a certificate for a film; and

      * (c) the making of rules by the Arts Minister (including rules for the establishment of the Film Certification Advisory Board) and the film authority; and

      * (d) review of decisions of the Arts Minister and the film authority; and

      * (e) amendment of assessments following the revocation of a certificate for a film.

          * Note: The location offset is a refundable tax offset: see section 6723.

     * (2) The company is not entitled to the location offset if:

      * (a) the company or someone else claims a deduction in relation to a unit of industrial property that relates to copyright in the *film under former Division 10B of Part III of the _Income Tax Assessment Act 1936_; or

      * (b) a final certificate for the film has been issued at any time under former Division 10BA of Part III of the _Income Tax Assessment Act 1936_ (whether or not the certificate is still in force); or

      * (c) a certificate for the film has been issued at any time under section 37645 (certificate for the PDV offset) (whether or not the certificate is still in force); or

      * (d) a certificate for the film has been issued at any time under section37665 (certificate for the producer offset) (whether or not the certificate is still in force).

##### 37625  Meaning of documentary

     * Meaning of documentary

     * (1) A *film is a **_documentary_** if the film is a creative treatment of actuality, having regard to:

      * (a) the extent and purpose of any contrived situation featured in the film; and

      * (d) any other relevant matters.

     * Exclusion of infotainment or lifestyle programs and magazine programs

      * (a) during that income year, the NRAS rent is *derived by the trustee of the trust, or *flows indirectly to the trustee as a partner or beneficiary because of a previous application of subsection (2) or this subsection; and

      * (b) the beneficiary has this amount for that income year (the **_share amount_**):

        * (ii) an individual interest in the trust's net income for that income year that is covered by section 98A or 100 of that Act;

     * Trustees

     * (4) *NRAS rent **_flows indirectly _**to the trustee of a trust in an income year if, and only if:

      * (a) during that income year, the NRAS rent is *derived by the trustee, or *flows indirectly to the trustee as a partner or beneficiary because of a previous application of subsection (2) or (3); and

##### 38030  Share of NRAS rent

     * Object of section

     * (1) The object of this section is to ensure that:

      * (a) *NRAS rent derived by a partnership or the trustee of a trust is allocated notionally amongst entities who *derive benefits from that NRAS rent; and

      * (b) that allocation corresponds with the way in which those benefits were derived.

     * (2) An entity's **_share_** of *NRAS rent is an amount notionally allocated to the entity as its share of the NRAS rent, whether or not the entity actually receives any of that NRAS rent.

     * (3) That amount is equal to the entity's **_share_** of the *NRAS rent as the focal entity in column 3 of an item of the table.

          * Note: An entity's share of the NRAS rent is based on the share of the NRAS rent of each preceding intermediary entity through which the NRAS rent flows, starting from the intermediary entity to whom the NRAS rent is paid.

          * This means that in some cases (see items 2 and 4 of the table), more than one item of the table will need to be applied to work out the share of the NRAS rent of an ultimate recipient of the NRAS rent.

          * Note: In item 3 or 4 of the table, the trustee of a trust can be both the intermediary entity and the focal entity in the same item.

##### 38595  Basic principles for elections under this Subdivision

     * (1) You can elect:

       * to spread the profit on the disposal or death over the income year of the disposal or death and the next 4 income years (**_election to spread_**); or

       * to defer including the profit in your assessable income, if you will use the proceeds of the disposal or death mainly to replace the live stock (**_election to defer_**).

     * (2) If you make an election to defer, the profit is "used" over the next 5 income years:

       * by reducing the amount for which you are taken to have bought replacement stock (as a result, your tax profit on the disposal of the replacement stock is increased); and

       * by including in your assessable income amounts for replacement stock that you breed.

     * Any unused part of the profit is included in your assessable income for the fifth income year.

##### Operative provisions

##### 385100  Cases where you can make an election

     * (1) You can make an election if:

      * (a) you dispose of *live stock, or they die, because:

        * (i) land is compulsorily acquired or resumed under an Act; or

        * (ii) a State or Territory leases land for a cattle tick eradication campaign; or

        * (iii) pasture or fodder is destroyed by fire, drought or flood and you will use the *proceeds of the disposal or death mainly to buy replacement stock or to maintain breeding stock for the purpose of replacing the live stock; or

        * (iv) they are compulsorily destroyed under an *Australian law for the control of a *disease or they die of such a *disease; or

        * (v) you receive an official notification under an *Australian law dealing with contamination of property; and

      * (b) you held the live stock as assets of a *primary production business you carry on in ; and

      * (c) apart from this Subdivision, your assessable income for any income year would include the *proceeds of the disposal or death.

     * (2) The **_proceeds of the disposal or death_** are:

      * (a) if you dispose of the *live stock or their carcases in the ordinary course of *business--the total of:

        * (i) any amount you receive as payment for the live stock or carcases; and

        * (ii) any compensation you receive for the death or destruction, or a reduction in *market value, of the live stock or their carcases from an *Australian government agency; or

      * (b) if you dispose of the *live stock or their carcases outside the ordinary course of *business--the total of:

        * (i) the market value of the live stock or their carcases, at the time of disposal; and

        * (ii) any compensation you receive for the death or destruction, or a reduction in market value, of the live stock or their carcases from an *Australian government agency; or

      * (c) if the *live stock die, and you do not dispose of their carcases to someone else--any compensation you receive for their death or destruction from an *Australian government agency.

##### 385105  Election to spread tax profit over 5 years

     * (1) You can elect:

      * (a) to include in your assessable income for the *disposal year the *proceeds of the disposal or death, reduced by the *tax profit on the disposal or death; and

      * (b) to include 20% of the tax profit on the disposal or death in your assessable income for the disposal year; and

      * (c) to include 20% of the tax profit on the disposal or death in your assessable income for each of the next 4 income years.

          * For rules about the making and effect of an election, see Subdivision 385H.

     * (2) The **_disposal year_** is the income year in which you dispose of the *live stock, or they die, as mentioned in subsection 385100(1).

     * (3) The **_tax profit on the disposal or death_** is any amount remaining after subtracting from the *proceeds of the disposal or death the sum of:

      * (a) the amount paid or payable for the purchase of as many of the *live stock as you purchased during the income year; and

      * (b) the *value of the rest of the live stock as *trading stock on hand at the start of the income year.

##### 385110  Alternative election to defer tax profit and reduce cost of replacement live stock

     * (1) Alternatively, you can elect:

      * (a) to include in your assessable income for the *disposal year the *proceeds of the disposal or death, reduced by the *tax profit on the disposal or death; and

      * (b) to reduce the cost of replacement *live stock you buy in the disposal year (or any of the next 5 income years) by amounts totalling not more than the tax profit on the disposal or death; and

      * (c) to include in your assessable income for the last of the 5 income years following the disposal year any *unused tax profit on the disposal or death on the last day of that year.

          * Note: If the election is made because of bovine tuberculosis, it has effect over 10 income years instead of 5: see section 385125.

          * For rules about the making and effect of an election, see Subdivision 385H

     * (2) However, you can only make this election if you will use the *proceeds of the disposal or death mainly to buy replacement *live stock, or to maintain breeding stock for the purpose of replacing the live stock that were disposed of or died.

     * (3) The **_unused tax profit on the disposal or death _**is the *tax profit on the disposal or death less the total of:

##### 385115  Your assessable income includes an amount for replacement live stock you breed

     * If you make the election in section 385110, then for the *disposal year and each of the next 5 income years, your assessable income includes any amount you choose for each replacement animal you breed during that income year. (However, you can choose not to include an amount.)

##### 385120  Purchase price of replacement live stock is reduced

     * Meaning of **reduction amount**

     * **	(2)	The **_reduction amount_** is:

### so much of the *tax profit on the disposal or death as is attributable to live stock of the species you are replacing;

     * divided by: 

### the number of animals of that species that you disposed of or that died.

     * (3) However, if:

      * (a) you purchase a replacement animal of a different species from the *live stock it replaces; and 

      * (b) you pay substantially more for it than you could have paid for a replacement animal of the same species;

     * the **_reduction amount_** for the animal is any reasonable amount at least equal to the amount worked out under subsection (2). 

     * Exception to avoid reducing unused tax profit to less than nil

     * (4) However, if applying subsection (1) to a particular purchase would reduce the *unused tax profit on the disposal or death to less than nil, instead reduce the amount paid or payable for the purchase of each replacement animal in that purchase by:

### the *unused tax profit on the disposal or death;

     * divided by: 

### the number of animals in the purchase.

##### Guide to Division 392

##### 3921  What this Division is about

     * If you are a primary producer for 2 or more years in a row, this Division evens out your income tax liability from year to year. (It does so by reducing the effect that fluctuations in your taxable income have on the marginal rates of tax that apply to you from year to year.)

##### Table of sections

       * 3925	Overview of averaging process

##### 3925  Overview of averaging process

     * How averaging adjustments work

     * (1) This Division reduces or increases your income tax liability to bring it closer to what it would have been if worked out using a special rate of income tax. That rate (the comparison rate) is based on the income tax that you would pay for the current year on the average of your taxable income for up to the last 5 income years.

          * Example: The graph shows how averaging taxable income reduces the effect of variations in taxable income (giving a fairly steady comparison rate from year to year).

     * Tax offset as averaging adjustment

     * (2) You may be entitled to a tax offset if the income tax you would pay on your basic taxable income for the current year at the comparison rate is _less_ than the income tax you would pay on that income (apart from this Division and certain other provisions).

          * See the examples of years 5, 6, 7 and 9 in the graph in subsection (4).

     * Extra income tax as averaging adjustment

     * (3) You may be liable to extra income tax on some or all of your basic taxable income for the current year if the income tax you would pay on your basic taxable income for the current year at the comparison rate is _more_ than the income tax on that income (apart from this Division and certain other provisions).

          * See the examples of years 8 and 10 in the graph in subsection (4).

     * Example of the effect of averaging

     * (4) The graph shows an example of the effect of averaging, using the same income figures as the graph in the example in subsection (1).

          * Note: The example assumes that all the basic taxable income was from a primary production business.

     * Effect of nonprimary production income on averaging adjustment

     * (5) Your income from sources other than your primary production business may affect the adjustment of your income tax. If more than $5,000 of your basic taxable income is attributable to those sources, your averaging adjustment will be reduced to reflect the proportion of your basic taxable income attributable to primary production. (There are special shadingout arrangements if your taxable income from other sources is between $5,000 and $10,000.)

     * No adjustment in certain cases

     * (6) Your income tax will not be adjusted under this Division in certain cases. In particular, you can choose not to have your income tax adjusted under this Division for the rest of your life.

          * Note 1: It follows that this Division does _not_ apply if your basic taxable income has decreased every income year since you started carrying on a primary production business.

          * Note 2: In working out whether this Division applies to your assessment for an income year, you may need to take account of income years before the 199899 income year: see section 3921 of the _Income Tax (Transitional Provisions) Act 1997_.

     * Continued application of this Division after you stop carrying on a primary production business

##### Tax offset or extra income tax

##### 39235  Will you get a tax offset or have to pay extra income tax? 

     * (1) Compare:

      * (a) the amount (the **_income tax you would pay at the comparison rate_**) worked out using the formula:

      * (b) the amount of income tax that you would pay on your *basic taxable income for the *current year at *basic rates.

          * Note: You must disregard some provisions of this Act in working out amounts of income tax for the purposes of this subsection: see subsection (5).

     * Tax offset

     * (2) You are entitled to a *tax offset equal to the *averaging adjustment worked out under Subdivision 392C if the income tax you would pay at the comparison rate is _less_ than the amount of income tax you would pay at *basic rates.

     * Extra income tax

     * (3) You must pay extra income tax on the *averaging component of your *basic taxable income if the income tax you would pay at the comparison rate is _more_ than the amount of income tax you would pay at *basic rates.

          * Note 1: Section 12A of the _Income Tax Rates Act 1986_ sets the rate at which you must pay extra income tax on the averaging component of your basic taxable income.

          * Note 2: It does so in such a way that, generally, the extra income tax you must pay equals the averaging adjustment worked out under Subdivision 392C.

     * Meaning of basic rates

     * (4) The **_basic rates_** at which you would pay income tax are:

      * (a) if you are a resident taxpayer as defined in the _Income Tax Rates Act 1986_--the rates of income tax in paragraph (1)(b) of Part I of Schedule 7 to that Act, taking into account the way it would apply with any changes to your taxfree threshold under section 20 of that Act; or

      * (b) if you are a nonresident taxpayer as defined in the _Income Tax Rates Act 1986_--the rates of income tax in paragraph 1(b) of Part II of Schedule 7 to that Act.

     * Disregard certain provisions in working out amounts

     * (5) Work out the amount of income tax mentioned in paragraph (1)(b) as if:

      * (a) the following provisions did not apply:

        * (i) this Division;

        * (ii) section 94 (Partner not having control and disposal of share in partnership income) of the _Income Tax Assessment Act 1936_;

        * (iii) Division 6AA (Income of certain children) of Part III of the _Income Tax Assessment Act 1936_;

        * (iv) Part VIIB (Medicare levy) of the _Income Tax Assessment Act 1936_; and

      * (b) you were not entitled to any rebate or credit under the _Income Tax Assessment Act 1936_ or to any *tax offset under this Act.

     * No adjustment

     * (6) This Division does not affect your income tax for the *current year if the income tax you would pay at the *comparison rate equals the amount of income tax you would pay at *basic rates.

          * Note: The 2 amounts will be equal if:

             * your basic taxable income and your average income are both below the taxfree threshold; or

             * your average income equals your basic taxable income for the current year.

##### How to work out the comparison rate

##### 39240  Identify income years for averaging your basic taxable income

     * The income years over which you must average your *basic taxable income are:

      * (a) if this Division has applied to your assessment for at least 4 income years in a row (including the *current year)--the current year and the 4 previous income years; or

      * (b) if this Division has applied to your assessment for less than 4 income years in a row (including the *current year)--those income years and the last income year before them.

          * Note: You may need to average your basic taxable income for one or more income years before the 199899 income year. See section 3921 of the _Income Tax (Transitional Provisions) Act 1997_.

##### 39245  Work out your average income for those years

     * (1) Work out your**_ average income_** in this way:

Method statement

        * Step 1.	Add up your *basic taxable income for each of the income years over which you must average your basic taxable income.

        * Step 2.	Divide the sum by the number of those income years.

        * Step 3.	Round the result down to the nearest whole dollar if the result is not already a number of whole dollars.

     * (2) Your **_basic assessable income_** for an income year is your assessable income for the income year, less:

      * (a) any amount included in your assessable income section 8265, 8270 or 302145 of the _Income Tax Assessment Act 1997_ (certain employment termination payments and superannuation benefits); and

      * (b) any *net capital gain included in your assessable income under Division 102 of the _Income Tax Assessment Act 1997_.

##### 39260  What this Subdivision is about

     * This Subdivision explains how to work out the amount of the averaging adjustment of your income tax for the current year (whether it is a tax offset or is used by the _Income Tax Rates Act 1986_ to set the rate at which you must pay extra income tax).

       * 39290	Work out your averaging component

##### 39265  What your averaging adjustment reflects

     * (1) Your averaging adjustment is a proportion of your gross averaging amount, taking account of:

      * (a) your taxable primary production income (the part of your basic taxable income from your primary production business); and

      * (b) your taxable nonprimary production income (the part of your basic taxable income from other sources).

     * Your averaging component is the means of taking into account the different parts of your basic taxable income in working out your averaging adjustment.

     * (2) If your taxable nonprimary production income is less than or equal to $5,000, your averaging component equals the whole of your basic taxable income. (In other words, your averaging component includes all of your taxable primary production income and all of your taxable nonprimary production income.) 

     * (3) If your taxable nonprimary production income is between $5,000 and $10,000, a shadingout system applies so that your averaging component includes some of your taxable nonprimary production income as well as all of your taxable primary production income.

     * (4) If your taxable nonprimary production income is $10,000 or more, your averaging component equals your taxable primary production income. Your averaging component does not include any of your taxable nonprimary production income.

     * (5) The following diagram shows examples of these relationships.

     * The second and third columns show that as taxable nonprimary production income increases above $5,000 (up to a maximum of $10,000), less of it is counted in the averaging component.

##### Your gross averaging amount

##### 39270  Working out your gross averaging amount

     * Your **_gross averaging amount_** is the amount of the difference between the following amounts worked out under section 39235:

      * (a) the income tax you would pay at the comparison rate;

      * (b) the amount of income tax that you would pay on your *basic taxable income for the *current year at *basic rates.

##### Your averaging adjustment

##### 39275  Working out your averaging adjustment

     * Work out your **_averaging adjustment_** for the *current year using the formula:

##### How to work out your averaging component

##### 39280  Work out your taxable primary production income

     * (1) Work out your **_taxable primary production income_** for the *current year in this way:

Method statement

        * Step 1.	Compare your *assessable primary production income for the *current year with your *primary production deductions for the current year.

        * Step 2.	If your assessable primary production income is larger than your primary production deductions, your **_taxable primary production income_** is the difference between them.

        * Step 3.	If your primary production deductions are larger than (or equal to) your assessable primary production income, your **_taxable primary production income_** is nil.

     * Assessable primary production income

     * (2) Your **_assessable primary production income_** for the *current year is the amount of your *basic assessable income for the current year that was *derived from, or resulted from, your carrying on a *primary production business.

     * Primary production deductions

     * (3) Your **_primary production deductions_** for the *current year are:

      * (a) all amounts you can deduct that relate exclusively to your *assessable primary production income for the current year; and

      * (b) so much of any other amounts you can deduct (other than *apportionable deductions) to the extent that they reasonably relate to your assessable primary production income for the current year.

##### 39285  Work out your taxable nonprimary production income

     * (1) Work out your **_taxable nonprimary production income_** for the *current year in this way:

Method statement

        * Step 1.	Compare your *assessable nonprimary production income for the *current year with your *nonprimary production deductions for the current year.

        * Step 2.	If your assessable nonprimary production income is larger than your nonprimary production deductions, your **_taxable nonprimary production income_** is the difference between them.

        * Step 3.	If your nonprimary production deductions are larger than (or equal to) your assessable nonprimary production income, your **_taxable nonprimary production income_** is nil.

     * Assessable nonprimary production income

     * (2) Your **_assessable nonprimary production income_** for the *current year is the difference between:

      * (a) your *basic assessable income for the current year; and

      * (b) your *assessable primary production income for the current year.

     * Nonprimary production deductions

     * (3) Your **_nonprimary production deductions_** for the *current year are the difference between:

      * (a) the sum of your deductions for the current year; and

      * (b) your *primary production deductions for the current year.

##### 39290  Work out your averaging component

     * (1) Work out your **_averaging component_** for the *current year using the following table, taking into account:

      * (a) your *taxable primary production income for the current year; and

      * (b) your *taxable nonprimary production income for the current year.

          * Note: Subsections (2) and (3) explain how to work out your nonprimary production shadeout amount if your taxable nonprimary production income is between $5,000 and $10,000.

     * Nonprimary production shadeout amount if your taxable primary production income is more than nil

     * (2) If your *taxable primary production income is more than nil, your **_nonprimary production shadeout amount_** is the amount worked out using the formula:

     * Nonprimary production shadeout amount if your taxable primary production income is nil

     * (3) If your *taxable primary production income is nil, your **_nonprimary production shadeout amount_** is the amount worked out using the formula:

     * However, if that amount is less than nil, your **_nonprimary production shadeout amount_** is nil.

     * (4) In this section:

     * **_Assessable PP income_** means your *assessable primary production income for the *current year.

     * **_PP deductions_** means your *primary production deductions for the *current year.

     * **_Taxable nonPP income_** your *taxable nonprimary production income for the *current year.

##### 39295  You are treated as if you had not carried on business before

     * Choosing to discontinue and restart averaging

     * (1) You can choose that this Division not affect your income tax liability for an income year (the **_reduction year_**) if you show the Commissioner that, because of retirement from your occupation or from any other cause, your *basic taxable income for the reduction year is permanently reduced during that year to less than two thirds of your *average income for that year.

     * (1A) You must make the choice by notifying the Commissioner in writing by the day you lodge your *income tax return for the reduction year. However, the Commissioner can allow you to make it later.

     * (1B) If you make a choice under subsection (1), this Division applies to assessments for later income years as if you had never carried on a *primary production business before the reduction year.

     * Working out the extent of the permanent reduction

     * (2) In working out the extent of the permanent reduction, you must work out your *average income for the reduction year on the basis that your *basic assessable income for an income year taken into account in working out your average income did _not_ include any assessable income from sources from which you do not usually receive assessable income.

     * (3) In working out the extent of the permanent reduction, disregard a reduction in *basic taxable income to the extent that it results from a change of assets from which assessable income was *derived into assets from which you derive income that is not assessable income.

##### Guide to Division 393

##### 3931  What this Division is about

     * You can deduct a farm management deposit you make, if:

          * (a) you are an individual carrying on a primary production business (including a primary production business you carry on as a partner in a partnership or as a beneficiary of a trust); and

          * (b) you hold the deposit for at least 12 months; and

          * (c) you meet some other tests.

     * The amount of the deposit withdrawn is included in your assessable income in the income year in which it is repaid. Special rules apply if the deposit is repaid in exceptional circumstances or in the event of an applicable natural disaster.

     * Farm management deposits allow you to carry over income from years of good cash flow and to draw down on that income in years when you need the cash. This enables you to defer the income tax on your taxable primary production income from the income year in which you make the deposit until the income year in which the deposit is repaid.

               * Note: An FMD provider must, every calendar month, give certain information to the Agriculture Secretary about farm management deposits: see section 3985 in Schedule 1 to the _Taxation Administration Act 1953_.

       * 39316	Consolidation of farm management deposits

##### 3935  Deduction for making farm management deposit

     * Entitlement to deduction

     * (1) You can deduct the amount of a *farm management deposit for an income year if:

      * (a) you are the *owner of the deposit; and

      * (b) the deposit is made at a time during the year when you are an individual carrying on a *primary production business in Australia; and

      * (c) if during the year, at a time after the deposit was made, you stopped carrying on a primary production business in Australia--you started carrying on such a business again within 120 days (whether or not during the year); and

      * (d) your *taxable nonprimary production income for the year is not more than $100,000; and

      * (e) you do not die or become bankrupt during the year.

          * Note 1: This section does not apply if a deposit is reinvested, the term of a deposit is extended, or a deposit is transferred at the depositor's request: see sections 39315 and 39316.

          * Note 2: This Division applies to certain partners and beneficiaries as if they were individuals who carried on a primary production business: see subsections 39325(2), (3), (4), (5) and (6).

     * Sum of deductions not to exceed taxable primary production income

     * (2) The sum of the deductions that you would otherwise be entitled to under this section for *farm management deposits made in the income year must _not_ exceed your *taxable primary production income for the income year.

     * Amounts to be deducted in order of deposits

     * (3) If you are entitled to deduct amounts in respect of 2 or more deposits, deduct the amounts in the order in which the deposits were made (until you reach the limit imposed by subsection (2)).

##### 39310  Assessability on repayment of deposit

     * Amount assessable

     * (1) Your assessable income for an income year includes the amount worked out using the following formula, if:

      * (a) you are the *owner of a *farm management deposit; and

      * (b) the deposit is repaid in full or in part in the year; and

      * (c) the amount worked out using the formula is greater than nil:

          * Note 1: This subsection does not apply if the deposit is reinvested, the term of the deposit is extended, or the deposit is transferred at the depositor's request: see sections 39315 and 39316.

          * Note 2: In a case where not all of the deposit is deductible under section 3935, repayment of the nondeductible amount can take place without the amount being assessable. Once that amount is repaid, the remainder is assessable when it is repaid, so that the deduction is recouped.

          * Example: Matt makes a farm management deposit of $120,000 on 1 April 2011. His taxable primary production income for the 2010--11 income year is $50,000; therefore, the deposit is only partly deductible in the year because it exceeds his taxable primary production income. Matt makes the following withdrawals from the deposit: $45,000 on 1 May 2013, $40,000 on 1 March 2014 and $35,000 on 1 September 2015.

          * The unrecouped FMD deduction immediately before the first repayment of $45,000 is $50,000. No amount is included in his assessable income for the 20122013 income year because the difference between the unrecouped FMD deduction ($50,000) and the amount of the deposit remaining after the repayment ($75,000) is less than nil.

          * The unrecouped FMD deduction immediately before the second repayment of $40,000 is $50,000. $15,000 is included in Matt's assessable income for the 20132014 income year because the difference between the unrecouped FMD deduction ($50,000) and the amount of the deposit remaining after the second repayment ($35,000) is $15,000, which is greater than nil.

          * The unrecouped FMD deduction immediately before the third repayment of $35,000 is $35,000; that is, $50,000 less $15,000. $35,000 is included in Matt's assessable income for the 20152016 income year; that is, the difference between the unrecouped FMD deduction ($35,000) and the amount of the deposit remaining after the third repayment ($0).

     * Unrecouped FMD deduction

     * (2) The **_unrecouped FMD deduction_** in respect of a *farm management deposit at a particular time is:

      * (a) if no part of the deposit has been repaid before that time--the amount of the deduction under section 3935 for making the deposit; or

      * (b) if one or more parts of the deposit have been repaid before that time--the unrecouped FMD deduction in respect of the deposit just before the most recent such repayment, reduced by any amount included in the *owner's assessable income under this section as a result of that repayment.

          * Example: Mia makes a deposit of $3,000, all of which is deductible. The deposit's unrecouped FMD deduction just before a first repayment of $1,000 is the amount of the deduction (that is, $3,000--see paragraph (2)(a)). The deposit's unrecouped FMD deduction just before a second repayment is $2,000 (that is, according to paragraph (2)(b), the unrecouped FMD deduction immediately before the first repayment ($3,000) reduced by the $1,000 included in Mia's assessable income as a result of the first repayment).

          * Note 1: If the deposit was originally an income equalisation deposit, see section 39310 of the _Income Tax (Transitional Provisions) Act 1997_.

          * Note 1A: Subsection 39316(3) affects the unrecouped FMD deduction of a consolidated farm management deposit.

          * Note 2: Section 39355 affects the unrecouped FMD deduction of a new deposit linked to an old deposit affected by Division 2AA (Financial claims scheme for accountholders with insolvent ADIs) of Part II of the _Banking Act 1959_.

     * Application of Division to transfer, reinvestment or other dealing

     * (3) This Division applies to a transfer, reinvestment or other dealing with a *farm management deposit as if it were a repayment of the deposit, if:

      * (a) you are the depositor; and

      * (b) the transfer, reinvestment or other dealing is on your behalf or at your request.

          * Note: Section 39315 modifies the application of the deduction, assessment and 12 month rules to certain transfers, reinvestments and other dealings.

     * Deemed repayment because of death, bankruptcy etc.

     * (4) This section applies as if a *farm management deposit had been repaid when it became repayable, rather than when it is actually repaid, if the deposit became repayable because of the requirement contained in the relevant agreement as set out in item 11 of the table in section 39335 (death, bankruptcy etc.).

          * Note 1: This means that the amount of the deposit is included in your assessable income for the income year when the death, bankruptcy etc. occurs, rather than for any later year in which the deposit might be repaid.

          * Note 2: This also means that, under subsection 45120(5) in Schedule 1 to the _Taxation Administration Act 1953_ (about Pay as you go (PAYG) instalments), the amount of the deposit is included in your instalment income for the period in which the death, bankruptcy etc. occurs.

          * However, under section 12140 in that Schedule, an amount may also be required to be withheld from the actual payment if you do not quote your tax file number or ABN to the relevant FMD provider.

          * Note 3: Section 39360 of this Act may limit the operation of subsection (4) if the farm management deposit is with an ADI that becomes a declared ADI under Division 2AA (Financial claims scheme for accountholders with insolvent ADIs) of Part II of the _Banking Act 1959_.

##### 39315  Transactions to which the deduction, assessment and 12 month rules have modified application

     * (1) The provisions mentioned in subsection (2) do not apply in relation to the following transactions:

      * (a) the immediate reinvestment of a *farm management deposit as a farm management deposit with the same *FMD provider;

      * (b) the extension of the term of a farm management deposit (even if other terms such as those relating to interest payable are also varied);

      * (c) the transfer of a farm management deposit in accordance with a requirement of the relevant agreement as set out in item 13 of the table in section 39335 (which allows for transfers of deposits at the request of the depositor).

          * Note: This means that these transactions:

            * (a) will not result in assessable income for the owner; and

            * (b) will not give rise to a deduction; and

            * (c) will not, if the transaction occurs within 12 months after the end of the day the deposit is made, result in the deposit losing its status as a farm management deposit.

     * (2) The provisions are:

      * (a) section 3935 (about deductions for making a farm management deposit); and

      * (b) subsection 39310(1) (about assessability of the repayment of a farm management deposit); and

      * (c) subsections 39340(1) and (2) (about repayment of a farm management deposit within the first 12 months); and

      * (d) subsections 39340(3A) and (4) (about repayment of a farm management deposit in the event of an applicable natural disaster).

     * (3) For the purposes of working out the *unrecouped FMD deduction for a deposit that is subject to a transaction mentioned in subsection (1), the transaction does not cause the deposit to be a different deposit.

          * Note: This ensures that the unrecouped FMD deduction (which affects how much income tax is assessed in the event of a repayment) equals the deduction for the original deposit, less any amount included in your assessable income because of a previous repayment of the deposit.

##### 39316  Consolidation of farm management deposits

     * (1) The provisions mentioned in subsection (2) do not apply in relation to the immediate reinvestment of 2 or more *farm management deposits (**_original deposits_**) if:

      * (a) just before the reinvestment occurs the balance of each of the original deposits is equal to the *unrecouped FMD deduction for the deposit; and

      * (b) the original deposits are immediately reinvested as a single farm management deposit with the same *FMD provider, or with a different FMD provider; and

      * (c) just before the reinvestment occurs the original deposits have each been held for a period of at least 12 months.

          * Note: This means that the reinvestment:

            * (a) will not result in assessable income for the owner; and

            * (b) will not give rise to a deduction.

     * (2) The provisions are:

      * (a) section 3935 (about deductions for making a farm management deposit); and

      * (b) subsection 39310(1) (about assessability of the repayment of a farm management deposit).

     * (3) Despite paragraph 39310(2)(a), the **_unrecouped FMD deduction_** in respect of the *farm management deposit at a time before any part of the deposit has been repaid is the sum of the unrecouped FMD deductions in respect of each of the original deposits just before the reinvestment occurred.

     * (4) Section 39340 (about the repayment of farm management deposits within 12 months) applies as if the new *farm management deposit was made on the same day that the most recent of the original deposits was made.

     * Primary production business carried on by a nonfixed trust with no income of the trust

     * (6) You satisfy the requirements in this subsection if you do not satisfy the requirements in subsection (5) and you are an individual and a chosen beneficiary of the trust referred to in subsection (3) for the purposes of section 39327 for the income year.

##### 39327  Trustee may choose that a beneficiary is a chosen beneficiary of the trust

     * (1) The trustee of a trust may choose that a beneficiary of the trust is a chosen beneficiary of the trust for an income year if the trust does not have any income of the trust for the income year to which a beneficiary of the trust could be presently entitled.

     * (2) The maximum number of choices that the trustee may make in respect of the trust for an income year is the higher of:

      * (a) the number of individuals to which subsection 39325(3) applied in the income year immediately before the current income year; and

      * (b) 12.

     * (3) A choice made under subsection (1) must be:

      * (a) in writing; and

      * (b) signed by the trustee and the person chosen.

     * (4) The trustee can make the choice no later than the time it lodges the trust's *income tax return for the income year to which the choice relates. However, the Commissioner can allow the trustee to make a choice at a later time.

     * (5) A choice cannot be revoked or varied.

##### 39328  Application of Division to beneficiary no longer under legal disability

     * If: 

      * (a) a *farm management deposit was made by a trustee on behalf of a beneficiary of a trust; and

      * (b) the beneficiary was under a legal disability when the deposit was made; and

      * (c) the beneficiary is no longer under a legal disability;

     * then this Division, and Division 4A of Part VA of the _Income Tax Assessment Act 1936_, apply as if the beneficiary had made the deposit.

          * Note: Division 4A of Part VA of the_ Income Tax Assessment Act 1936_ is about quotation of tax file numbers in connection with farm management deposits.

##### 39330  Effect of contravening requirements

     * (1) A deposit is not a **_farm management deposit_** if, when the deposit was accepted, a requirement contained in the relevant agreement as set out in items 1 to 6 of the table in section 39335 was contravened.

     * (2) A deposit is not, and is taken never to have been, a **_farm management deposit_** if a requirement contained in the relevant agreement as set out in items 7 to 9 of the table in section 39335 is contravened at any time in relation to the deposit.

     * (3) So much of a deposit as causes a requirement contained in the relevant agreement as set out in item 10 of the table in section 39335 to be contravened is not a **_farm management deposit_**.

##### 39335  Requirements of agreement for a farm management deposit

     * An agreement mentioned in paragraph 39320(1)(b) must contain requirements to the effect of those set out in the following table:

##### 39340  Repayment of deposit within first 12 months

     * Partial repayment within first 12 months

     * (1) Any part of a deposit repaid before the last day of the 12 months after the day the deposit is made is not, and is taken never to have been, part of a **_farm management deposit_**.

          * Note 1: A repayment covered by subsection (3A) or (5) is disregarded in applying this subsection. The normal rules in sections 3935 (about deductions for making a farm management deposit) and 39310 (about assessability of the repayment of a farm management deposit) apply instead.

          * Note 2: This subsection does not apply if a deposit is reinvested, the term of a deposit is extended, or a deposit is transferred at the depositor's request: see section 39315.

     * Deposit not to be reduced to less than $1,000 within first 12 months

     * (2) A deposit is not, and is taken never to have been, a **_farm management deposit_** if the amount of the deposit is reduced to less than $1,000 because of one or more repayments before the last day of the 12 months after the day the deposit is made.

          * Note 1: A repayment covered by subsection (3A) or (5) is disregarded in applying this subsection.

          * Note 2: This subsection does not apply if a deposit is reinvested, the term of a deposit is extended, or a deposit is transferred at the depositor's request: see section 39315.

     * Repayment in the event of an applicable natural disaster

     * (3A) Subsections (1) and (2) do not apply to a repayment of the whole or a part of a *farm management deposit if:

      * (a) natural disaster relief and recovery arrangements made by or on behalf of the Commonwealth apply, in a way specified in regulations made for the purposes of this subsection, to a *primary production business of the *owner of the deposit; and

      * (b) all of the other circumstances specified in those regulations are satisfied.

     * Any later deposit not a farm management deposit

     * (4) If subsection (3A) applies to an *owner and a repayment, any later deposit that is made by, or on behalf of, the owner in the income year in which the repayment is made is not, and is taken never to have been, a **_farm management deposit_**.

     * Repayment in the case of death, bankruptcy or ceasing to carry on a primary production business

     * (5) Subsections (1) and (2) do not apply to a repayment of a *farm management deposit because of the requirement contained in the relevant agreement as set out in item 11 of the table in section 39335 (death, bankruptcy etc.).

     * Certain transactions do not affect the day the deposit was made

     * (6) Subsections (1) to (4) apply as if a *farm management deposit that:

      * (a) is made as a result of a transaction mentioned in subsection 39315(1) (about reinvesting a deposit, extending the term of a deposit and transferring a deposit at the depositor's request); or

      * (b) is affected by such a transaction;

     * were made on the day on which the original deposit was made.

          * Example: A farm management deposit is made on 1 July 2010 for a term of 6 months, but is extended in December 2010 for another 6 months. For the purposes of subsections (1) to (4), the day the extended deposit was made remains as 1 July 2010.

          * Note: Section 39340 of the _Income Tax (Transitional Provisions) Act 1997_ provides for a special rule for deposits transferred under the repealed _Loan (Income Equalization Deposits) Act 1976_.

##### 39345  Partly repaid farm management deposits

     * A reference to a **_farm management deposit_** is a reference to so much of the deposit as has not been repaid.

##### Subdivision 393C--Special rules relating to financial claims scheme for accountholders with insolvent ADIs

##### Guide to Subdivision 393C

##### 39350  What this Subdivision is about

     * A deposit (the **_new deposit_**) arising from:

          * (a) an entitlement under Division 2AA (Financial claims scheme for accountholders with insolvent ADIs) of Part II of the _Banking Act 1959_ relating to a farm management deposit (the **_old deposit_**); or

          * (b) a distribution from liquidation of an ADI that is attributable to a farm management deposit (also the **_old deposit_**);

     * is treated as a transfer of the old deposit and does not give rise to new assessable income or deductions.

##### Table of sections

   * Operative provisions

       * 39355	Farm management deposits arising from farm management deposits with ADIs subject to financial claims scheme

       * 39360	Repayment if owner of farm management deposit with insolvent ADI dies, is bankrupt or ceases to be a primary producer

##### Operative provisions

##### 39355  Farm management deposits arising from farm management deposits with ADIs subject to financial claims scheme

     * Application

     * (1) This section applies if an entitlement arises under Division 2AA (Financial claims scheme for accountholders with insolvent ADIs) of Part II of the _Banking Act 1959_ in connection with an account containing a *farm management deposit (the **_old deposit_**) with an *ADI (the **_old ADI_**) and either:

      * (a) an amount (the **_new deposit_**) is deposited into either of the following to meet, in whole or part, so much of the entitlement as relates to the old deposit:

        * (i) an existing account for a farm management deposit;

        * (ii) an account established under section 16AH of that Act for the purposes of meeting (in whole or part) the entitlement; or

      * (b) an amount (also the **_new deposit_**) is deposited by a liquidator of the old ADI into either of the following as so much of a distribution from the liquidation of the old ADI as relates to the old deposit:

        * (i) an existing account for a farm management deposit;

        * (ii) an account established under section 16AR of that Act for the payment of the distribution.

          * Note: If an amount is deposited in connection with an account with the old ADI containing 2 or more old deposits, the amount is to be apportioned between each old deposit, so that so much of the amount as is attributable to a particular old deposit is regarded as a distinct new deposit relating to that old deposit.

     * New deposit is a farm management deposit

     * (2) This Division (except this section) applies to the new deposit as if the new deposit were a transfer of the old deposit in accordance with a requirement contained in the relevant agreement for the old deposit as set out in item 13 of the table in section 39335 (which allows for transfers of deposits at the request of the depositor). To avoid doubt, this Division applies in that way as if the amount transferred were the amount of the new deposit, even if that is more or less than the amount of the old deposit.

          * Note 1: The effects of this include the following:

            * (a) section 3935 (about deductions for making a farm management deposit) does not apply in relation to the making of the new deposit (see paragraphs 39315(1)(c) and (2)(a));

            * (b) subsection 39310(1) (about assessability of the repayment of a farm management deposit) can only apply to the extent of any difference between the amount transferred and the amount of the old deposit (see paragraphs 39315(1)(c) and (2)(b));

            * (c) subsections 39340(1), (2) and (4) (about repayment of a farm management deposit within the first 12 months) can only apply to the extent of any difference between the amount transferred and the amount of the old deposit (see paragraphs 39315(1)(c) and (2)(c) and (d));

            * (d) the day the old deposit was made, for the purposes of subsections 39340(1) and (2) (about repayment of a farm management deposit within the first 12 months) and (3A) and (4) (about repayment in the event of an applicable natural disaster), is maintained for the new deposit (see subsection 39340(6)).

          * Note 2: Also, the unrecouped FMD deduction in respect of the new deposit is the same as the unrecouped FMD deduction in respect of the old deposit (see subsection 39315(3)), unless subsection (6) or (7) of this section applies because the new deposit is less than the old deposit.

     * (3) In determining whether either of the following is a *farm management deposit, disregard a requirement contained in an agreement as set out in item 4 of the table in section 39335 (requiring the deposit to be $1,000 or more):

      * (a) the new deposit;

      * (b) a deposit made later directly by the transfer of the new deposit in accordance with a requirement of the relevant agreement for the new deposit as mentioned in item 13 of that table.

     * Unrecouped FMD deduction for new deposit less than old deposit

     * (6) Despite subsection (2) and subsection 39315(3), if the new deposit is less than the old deposit at the time (the **_declaration time_**) the old ADI became a declared ADI under the _Banking Act 1959_, the **_unrecouped FMD deduction_** in respect of the new deposit is the amount worked out using the following formula:

          * Note: The new deposit could be less than the old deposit if the entitlement is paid in instalments (each of which will be a separate new deposit).

     * (7) However, if the amount worked out under subsection (6) is more than the difference (if any) between:

      * (a) the *unrecouped FMD deduction in respect of the old deposit just before the declaration time; and

      * (b) the total of the amounts worked out under all previous applications of subsection (6) in relation to that old deposit;

     * the **_unrecouped FMD deduction_** in respect of the new deposit is equal to the difference (if any).

          * Note: This ensures that when new deposits linked to the old deposit are repaid, the total amount included in assessable income will not exceed the unrecouped FMD deduction in respect of the old deposit.

     * Relationship with other provisions

     * (8) This section has effect despite Division 253 (about tax treatment of entitlements under the financial claims scheme for insolvent ADIs).

##### 39360  Repayment if owner of farm management deposit with insolvent ADI dies, is bankrupt or ceases to be a primary producer

     * Subsection 39310(4) does not apply in relation to so much of a *farm management deposit with an *ADI as is equal to the sum of the amounts described in subparagraphs (d)(i) and (ii) of this section if:

      * (a) you are the *owner of the deposit; and

      * (b) the deposit becomes repayable during an income year because of the requirement contained in the relevant agreement as set out in item 11 of the table in section 39335 (death, bankruptcy etc.); and

      * (c) during the income year, the ADI becomes a declared ADI under Division 2AA (Financial claims scheme for accountholders with insolvent ADIs) of Part II of the _Banking Act 1959_; and

      * (d) at the end of the income year, you have either or both of the following:

        * (i) an unmet entitlement under that Division connected with the account for the farm management deposit;

        * (ii) an unmet claim against the ADI, or an unpaid debt owed to you by the ADI, in the winding up of the ADI connected with the account for the deposit.

          * Note: Subsection 39310(4) makes the repayment of a farm management deposit assessable in the income year when the death, bankruptcy etc. occurs, rather than in any later year in which it might be repaid.

#### Division 394--Forestry managed investment schemes

##### Guide to Division 394

##### 3941  What this Division is about

     * This Division sets out rules about deductions for contributions to forestry managed investment schemes. It also sets out the tax treatment of proceeds from the sale of interests in such schemes, and of proceeds from harvesting trees under such schemes.

       * 39440	Payments under forestry managed investment scheme

       * 39445	Direct forestry expenditure

##### 3945  Object of this Division

     * The object of this Division is to encourage the expansion of commercial plantation forestry in  through the establishment and tending of new plantations for felling. This is achieved by:

      * (a) permitting investors to deduct amounts paid under a forestry scheme in the year of payment, if certain conditions are met (for example, that it is reasonable to expect that the manager of the scheme will spend at least 70% of investors' contributions, on a market value basis, on activities that establish, tend, fell and harvest trees); and

      * (b) allowing secondary market trading of interests in such schemes, while minimising tax arbitrage and providing tax certainty for investors.

##### 39410  Deduction for amounts paid under forestry managed investment schemes

     * (1) You can deduct an amount if:

      * (a) you hold a *forestry interest in a *forestry managed investment scheme; and

      * (b) you pay the amount under the scheme; and

      * (c) the scheme satisfies the *70% DFE rule (see section 39435) on 30 June in the income year in which a *participant in the scheme first pays an amount under the scheme; and

      * (d) you do not have day to day control over the operation of the scheme (whether or not you have the right to be consulted or give directions); and

      * (e) at least one of these conditions is satisfied:

        * (i) there is more than one participant in the scheme;

        * (ii) the *forestry manager of the scheme, or an *associate of the forestry manager, manages, arranges or promotes similar schemes; and

      * (f) the condition in subsection (4) is satisfied.

     * (2) You deduct the amount for the income year in which you pay it.

     * (3) For the purposes of this Division, do _not_ treat an amount as being paid under a *forestry managed investment scheme if:

      * (a) you pay the amount in connection with a *CGT event in relation to a *forestry interest in the scheme; and

      * (b) as a result of the CGT event:

        * (i) another *participant in the scheme no longer holds the forestry interest; and

        * (ii) you start to hold the forestry interest.

     * (4) For the purposes of paragraph (1)(f), the condition in this subsection is satisfied unless:

      * (a) 18 months have elapsed since the end of the income year in which an amount is first paid under the *forestry managed investment scheme by a *participant in the scheme; and

      * (b) the trees intended to be established in accordance with the scheme have not all been established before the end of those 18 months.

     * (5) You cannot deduct an amount under subsection (1) if:

      * (a) you hold the *forestry interest mentioned in paragraph (1)(a) as an *initial participant; and

      * (b) a *CGT event happens in relation to the forestry interest within 4 years after the end of the income year in which you first pay an amount under the scheme.

     * If you have already deducted it, your assessment may be amended to disallow the deduction.

     * (5A) Paragraph (5)(b) does not apply to a *CGT event if:

      * (a) the CGT event happens because of circumstances outside your control; and

            * Example: The forestry interest is compulsorily acquired.

      * (b) when you acquired the *forestry interest, you could not reasonably have foreseen the CGT event happening.

     * (6) Despite section 170 of the _Income Tax Assessment Act 1936_, the Commissioner may amend your assessment at any time within 2 years after the *CGT event, for the purpose of giving effect to subsection (5).

     * (7) Sections 82KZMD and 82KZMF of the _Income Tax Assessment Act 1936_ do not affect the timing of a deduction under this section.

##### 39415  Forestry managed investment schemes and related concepts

     * (1) A *scheme is a **_forestry managed investment scheme _**if the purpose of the scheme is for establishing and tending trees for felling in .

     * (2) The entity that manages, arranges or promotes a *forestry managed investment scheme is the **_forestry manager_** of the scheme.

     * (3) A **_forestry interest_** in a *forestry managed investment scheme is a right to benefits produced by the scheme (whether the right is actual, prospective or contingent and whether it is enforceable or not).

     * (4) An entity that holds a *forestry interest in a *forestry managed investment scheme (other than the *forestry manager of the scheme) is a **_participant _**in the scheme.

     * (5) A *participant in a *forestry managed investment scheme holds a *forestry interest in the scheme as an **_initial participant_** if:

      * (a) the participant obtains the forestry interest from the *forestry manager of the scheme; and

      * (b) the payment by the participant to obtain the forestry interest results in the establishment of trees.

##### 39420  Payments on behalf of participant in forestry managed investment scheme

     * For the purposes of this Division, treat a payment to the *forestry manager of a *forestry managed investment on behalf of a *participant in the scheme as a payment by the participant to the forestry manager.

##### 39425  CGT event in relation to forestry interest in forestry managed investment scheme--initial participant

     * (1) This section applies if:

      * (a) you hold a *forestry interest in a *forestry managed investment scheme as an *initial participant in the scheme; and

      * (b) at least one of these conditions is satisfied:

        * (i) you can deduct or have deducted an amount for an income year under section 39410 in relation to the forestry interest;

        * (ii) the condition in subparagraph (i) would be satisfied if subsection 39410(5) were disregarded; and

      * (c) a *CGT event happens in relation to the forestry interest, other than a CGT event that happens in respect of thinning.

     * (2) Your assessable income for the income year in which the *CGT event happens includes:

      * (a) if, as a result of the CGT event, you no longer hold the *forestry interest--the *market value of the forestry interest (worked out as at the time of the event); or

      * (b) otherwise--the decrease (if any) in the market value of the forestry interest as a result of the CGT event.

     * (3) Any amount that you actually receive because of the *CGT event is not included in your assessable income (nor is it *exempt income).

##### 39430  CGT event in relation to forestry interest in forestry managed investment scheme--subsequent participant

     * (1) This section applies if:

      * (a) you hold a *forestry interest in a *forestry managed investment scheme otherwise than as an *initial participant in the scheme; and

      * (b) at least one of these conditions is satisfied:

        * (i) you can deduct or have deducted an amount for an income year under section 39410 in relation to the forestry interest;

        * (ii) you could deduct an amount for an income year under section 39410 if you had paid the amount under the scheme in that year; and

      * (c) a *CGT event happens in relation to the forestry interest, other than a CGT event that happens in respect of thinning.

     * (2) Your assessable income for the income year in which the *CGT event happens includes the lesser of the following:

      * (a) the *market value of the forestry interest (worked out as at the time of the event);

      * (b) the amount (if any) by which the *total forestry scheme deductions in relation to the forestry interest exceeds the *incidental forestry scheme receipts in relation to the forestry interest.

     * (3) The **_total forestry scheme deductions _**in relation to the *forestry interest is the total of each amount that you can deduct or have deducted under section 39410 for each income year in relation to the forestry interest.

     * (4) The **_incidental forestry scheme receipts_** in relation to the *forestry interest is the total of each amount that you have received under the scheme in each income year in relation to the forestry interest for a reason otherwise than because of the *CGT event.

     * (5) However, if you still hold the forestry interest despite the *CGT event, work out the amount included in your assessable income under subsection (2) using this formula (instead of using the amount worked out under subsection (2)):

     * (6) If this section has operated previously in relation to the *forestry interest, disregard an amount for the purposes of subsections (3) and (4) to the extent that it has already been reflected in your assessable income under that previous operation in relation to the forestry interest.

     * (7) These provisions do not apply to the *CGT event:

      * (a) section 65 (about *ordinary income);

      * (b) any other provision that includes an amount in assessable income, other than the following:

        * (i) a provision in Part 31 or 33;

        * (ii) subsection (2) of this section;

      * (c) section 81 (about amounts you can deduct);

      * (d) any other provision that allows you to deduct an amount from your assessable income;

      * (e) section 11820.

     * (8) However, the provisions referred to in subsection (7) can apply to the *CGT event if a *capital gain or *capital loss from the event is disregarded because of section 11825.

     * (9) Just before the *CGT event, increase the *cost base and *reduced cost base of the *forestry interest by the amount included in your assessable income under subsection (2).

##### 39435  70% DFE rule

     * (1) A *forestry managed investment scheme satisfies the **_70% DFE rule_** on 30 June in an income year if it is reasonable to expect on that 30 June that the amount of DFE under the scheme (see subsection (2)) is no less than 70% of the amount of the payments under the scheme (see subsection (3)).

     * (2) The amount of DFE under the scheme is the amount of the net present value (on that 30 June) of all *direct forestry expenditure under the scheme that the *forestry manager of the scheme has paid or will pay under the scheme.

     * (3) The amount of payments under the scheme is the amount of the net present value (on that 30 June) of all amounts that all current and future *participants in the scheme have paid or will pay under the scheme.

     * (4) In working out the net present value of an amount paid before that 30 June:

      * (a) unless paragraph (b) applies--treat the amount as having been paid on that 30 June; or

      * (b) if the amount was paid in an income year ending before that 30 June--treat the amount as having been paid on the 30 June in that income year.

     * (5) In working out the net present value of an amount expected to be paid after that 30 June, treat the amount as having been paid on 1 January in the income year in which it is expected to be paid.

     * (6) Reduce an amount worked out under subsection (2) or (3) to the extent (if any) to which that amount can reasonably be expected to be recouped.

     * (7) In working out the net present value of an amount for the purposes of this section, use the yield on Australian Government Treasury Bonds with the maturity closest to 10 years (as published by the Reserve Bank of ).

     * (8) For the purposes of subsection (2), if:

      * (a) the *forestry manager of the scheme has paid or will pay an amount under the scheme in a transaction; and

      * (b) the forestry manager and at least one other party to the transaction did not or will not deal at *arm's length in relation to the transaction; and

      * (c) the amount is or will be more or less than the *market value of what it is for;

     * treat the amount as that market value.

##### 39440  Payments under forestry managed investment scheme

     * For the purposes of this Division, do _not_ treat the following payments as payments under a *forestry managed investment scheme by a *participant in the scheme:

      * (a) payments for *borrowing money;

      * (b) payments of interest and payments in the nature of interest;

      * (c) payments of stamp duty;

      * (d) payments of *GST;

      * (e) payments that relate to one or more of the matters mentioned in paragraphs 39445(4)(a), (b) or (c).

##### 39445  Direct forestry expenditure

     * (1) **_Direct forestry expenditure _**under a *forestry managed investment scheme means:

      * (a) an amount paid under the scheme that is attributable to establishing, tending, felling and harvesting trees; and

      * (b) notional amounts reflecting the *market value of goods, services or the use of land, provided by the *forestry manager of the scheme, for establishing, tending, felling and harvesting trees.

##### Guide to Division 405

##### 4051  What this Division is about

     * Significant fluctuations can occur in the professional incomes of authors, inventors, performing artists, production associates and sportspersons.

     * To lessen the impact of these fluctuations on your marginal tax rates, special tax rates apply if your professional income is above your average.

     * This Division explains how the scheme works and sets out the rules for working out your aboveaverage special professional income.

##### Table of sections

       * 4055	Special rate of income tax on your aboveaverage special professional income

       * 40510	Overview of the Division

##### 4055  Special rate of income tax on your aboveaverage special professional income

     * (1) If you have aboveaverage special professional income, the _Income Tax Rates Act 1986_ generally sets a special rate so that the amount of income tax you pay on the top 4/5 of your aboveaverage special professional income is effectively 4 times what you would pay on the bottom 1/5 of that income at basic rates.

          * Note : Your overall income tax will be less only if 2 marginal rates of income tax would apply to your aboveaverage special professional income if it were treated as the top slice of your taxable income.

     * (2) The following diagram illustrates how the special rate works.

##### 40510  Overview of the Division

     * For which income years do you have aboveaverage special professional income?

     * (1) The first income year for which you have aboveaverage special professional income is the first income year (professional year 1):

      * (a) for which your taxable professional income is more than $2,500; and

      * (b) during all or part of which you are an Australian resident.

     * (2) After professional year 1, you have aboveaverage special professional income for any income year for all or part of which you are an Australian resident.

          * Note: You need not have been an Australian resident for every income year since professional year 1.

     * What is aboveaverage special professional income?

     * (3) Your aboveaverage special professional income for the current year is the amount (if any) by which your taxable professional income _exceeds_ your average taxable professional income.

          * See Subdivision 405A.

     * What is taxable professional income?

     * (4) Your taxable professional income depends on your assessable professional income.

          * See section 40545.

     * (5) Your assessable professional income is assessable income from your work as an author, inventor, performing artist, production associate or sportsperson.

          * See Subdivision 405B.

     * How do you work out your average taxable professional income?

     * (6) Generally, your average taxable professional income for the current year is the average of your taxable professional income for the last 4 income years.

          * See section 40550.

     * (7) However, special phasingin arrangements apply to work out your average taxable professional income for an income year that is less than 4 income years after professional year 1.

     * These arrangements favour people who were Australian residents for at least part of the income year _before_ professional year 1.

          * See section 40550.

##### Table of sections

       * 40515	When do you have aboveaverage special professional income?

##### 40515  When do you have aboveaverage special professional income?

     * (1) Your taxable income for the *current year includes **_aboveaverage special professional income_** if and only if:

      * (a) you are an individual; and

      * (b) you have been an Australian resident for all or part of the current year; and

      * (c) your *taxable professional income for the current year exceeds your *average taxable professional income for the current year; and

        * (ii) your *taxable professional income for an earlier income year was more than $2,500 and you were an Australian resident for all or part of that income year.

     * How much aboveaverage special professional income do you have?

     * (2) The amount of *aboveaverage special professional income in your taxable income for the *current year is the difference between:

      * (a) your *taxable professional income for the current year; and

      * (b) your *average taxable professional income for the current year.

Method statement

        * Step 1.	Add up any amounts you can deduct for that year (except *apportionable deductions), so far as they reasonably relate to your *assessable professional income for the year.

        * Step 2.	Work out the amount using the formula:

               * Note: The result may be greater than the apportionable deductions. Also, it may be negative.

        * Step 3.	Add the sum from Step 1 to the result from Step 2. If the result is more than nil, it is the amount of your deductions to be subtracted from your *assessable professional income.

##### Table of sections

       * 4155	Object of this Division

##### 4155  Object of this Division

     * The object of this Division is to reduce the disincentives for private expenditure on nationally significant infrastructure that result from the long lead times between incurring deductions for, and earning assessable income from, such expenditure.

##### Subdivision 415B--Tax losses and bad debts

##### Guide to Subdivision 415B

##### 41510  What this Subdivision is about

     * The unutilised amounts of a designated infrastructure project entity's tax losses are increased each year by the long term bond rate. A **_designated infrastructure project entity_** is a fixed trust or company that:

          * (a) carries on an infrastructure project designated under Subdivision 415C; and

          * (b) only engages, and has only ever engaged, in activities for the purposes of carrying on that designated infrastructure project.

     * The tests that apply in relation to tax losses and bad debts if there is a change of ownership of an entity are modified so that periods during which the entity is a designated infrastructure project entity are not tested.

     * The loss utilisation rules in Subdivision 707C do not apply if the head company of a consolidated group is a designated infrastructure project entity after another designated infrastructure project entity joins the group.

               * Note: The transfer rules in subsection 707120(1A) do not apply if a designated infrastructure project entity joins a consolidated group: see subsection 707120(5).

##### Uplift of tax losses

##### 41515  Uplift of tax losses of designated infrastructure project entities

     * (1) The amount of a *tax loss of a *loss year of an entity is increased, at the end of each later income year (and before any *utilisation of the tax loss by the entity in the later income year), by the amount worked out using the following formula:

     * where: 

     * **_eligible portion of the later income year_** means the amount worked out using the following formula:

     * (2) This subsection applies to the entity on a day in the later income year if:

      * (a) the entity is a *designated infrastructure project entity on that day; and

      * (b) on the day mentioned in subsection (3), the entity has notified the Commissioner (whether before, during or after the later income year) in the *approved form that the entity was, at any time, a designated infrastructure project entity.

     * (3) For the purposes of paragraph (2)(b), the day is the day after the latest of the following days:

      * (a) the day before which the entity:

        * (i) is required to lodge its *income tax return for the later income year with the Commissioner; or

        * (ii) if the entity is not required to lodge an income tax return for the later income year--would be required to lodge its income tax return for the later income year were the entity required to lodge such a return;

      * (b) the 28th day after the first day the entity *carries on the infrastructure project mentioned in paragraph 41520(1)(b);

      * (c) the 28th day after the day the *Infrastructure CEO designates the infrastructure project under section 41570;

      * (d) a later day allowed by the Commissioner.

          * Note: The increase under this section can occur at the end of an income year even if, at the end of the year, the entity does not know the entity is a designated infrastructure project entity (e.g. because the Infrastructure CEO has not yet designated the infrastructure project that the entity carries on, but the Infrastructure CEO does so later).

     * Consolidated groups

     * (4) Disregard paragraph 70130(3)(a) for the purposes of the denominator in the formula in the definition of **_eligible portion of the later income year_** in subsection (1) of this section.

          * Note: Paragraph 70130(3)(a) applies if the entity becomes a subsidiary member of a consolidated group during the later income year.

##### Guide to Division 418

##### 4181  What this Division is about

     * Generally speaking, you are entitled to a tax offset for exploration credits issued to you, but exploration credits issued to corporate tax entities instead give rise to franking credits.

     * For the 201516, 201617 or 201718 income year, a greenfields minerals explorer can create, and then issue, exploration credits for the explorer's greenfields minerals expenditure for the previous income year. However, the total amount of exploration credits for an income year is limited to the explorer's maximum exploration credit amount.

     * The explorer is liable to pay excess exploration credit tax if the explorer issues exploration credits in excess of that maximum exploration credit amount.

          * Note: Excess exploration credit tax is imposed by the _Excess Exploration Credit Tax Act 2015_, and the amount of the tax is set out in that Act.

##### Subdivision 418A--Object of this Division

      * the exploration credit would be a distribution to which paragraph 207110(1)(b) would apply.

     * (2) If:

      * (a) an *exploration credit is issued to a *life insurance company; and

      * (b) paragraph (1)(d) applies in relation to only part of the exploration credit;

      * (b) expenditure referred to in paragraph (1)(b).

     * (5) The Commissioner may request an entity that is a *greenfields minerals explorer in an income year to prepare, within the period specified in the request, a report that:

      * (a) is of the kind referred to in paragraph (3)(c); and

      * (b) relates to an area in relation to which the entity has *greenfields minerals expenditure for the income year.

     * The request may specify the manner in which, and the form in which, the report is to be prepared.

##### 41885  Exploration credits must not exceed maximum exploration credit amount

     * (1) An entity must not create *exploration credits for an income year (the **_current income year_**) of a total amount that exceeds the entity's *maximum exploration credit amount for the income year.

     * (2) The entity's **_maximum exploration credit amount_** for the current income year is worked out as follows:

Method statement

        * Step 1.	Ascertain which of the following is the smallest amount:

          * (a) the entity's estimated *tax loss for the previous income year, as stated in the entity's declaration under paragraph 41870(1)(b);

          * (b) the entity's actual tax loss for the previous income year;

          * (c) the entity's estimated *greenfields minerals expenditure for the previous income year, as stated in the entity's declaration under paragraph 41870(1)(b);

          * (d) the entity's actual greenfields minerals expenditure for the previous income year.

        * Step 2.	Multiply that smallest amount by the *corporate tax rate applying to the previous income year.

        * Step 3.	Multiply the result of step 2 by the modulation factor declared under section 41890 for the current income year. The result of this step is the entity's **_maximum exploration credit amount_** for the current income year.

     * (3) In working out the entity's actual *tax loss for the previous income year for the purposes of step 1 of the method statement in subsection (2), reduce that tax loss by the sum of:

      * (a) all *recoupments that the entity receives in relation to the entity's *greenfields minerals expenditure for the previous income year; and

      * (b) any part of the entity's tax loss for the previous income year that would not be deductible in the current income year; and

      * (c) if:

        * (i) an amount has been included in the entity's assessable income because a *balancing adjustment event occurs for a *depreciating asset; and

        * (ii) all or part of the amount of the deduction to which the entity is entitled under section 4025 for the previous income year in relation to the decline in value of the asset is included in the entity's greenfields minerals expenditure for that income year;

      * so much of the amount of that deduction as was included in that greenfields minerals expenditure.

     * (4) For the purposes of paragraph (3)(b), assume that the entity's assessable income for the current income year is sufficient to allow the entity to utilise the whole of that tax loss in relation to the current income year.

     * (5) In working out the entity's actual *greenfields minerals expenditure for the previous income year for the purposes of step 1 of the method statement in subsection (2), reduce that greenfields minerals expenditure by the sum of:

      * (a) all *recoupments that the entity receives in relation to the entity's greenfields minerals expenditure for the previous income year; and

      * (b) if:

        * (i) an amount has been included in the entity's assessable income because a *balancing adjustment event occurs for a *depreciating asset; and

        * (ii) all or part of the amount of the deduction to which the entity is entitled under section 4025 for the previous income year in relation to the decline in value of the asset is included in the entity's greenfields minerals expenditure for that income year;

      * so much of the amount of that deduction as was included in that greenfields minerals expenditure.

     * (6) A failure to comply with this section does not invalidate the creation of an *exploration credit.

##### 41890  Modulation factors

     * (1) The Commissioner must, by legislative instrument, declare modulation factors in accordance with this section for each of the following:

      * (a) the 201516 income year;

      * (b) the 201617 income year;

      * (c) the 201718 income year.

     * (2) The modulation factor for an income year is to be one if the Commissioner is satisfied that the total amount of *exploration credits that could be created in respect of that income year will not exceed the following amount (the **_exploration credit cap_**) for the income year:

      * (a) for the 201516 income year--$25 million;

      * (b) for the 201617 income year--$35 million;

      * (c) for the 201718 income year--$40 million.

     * (3) If subsection (2) does not apply, the modulation factor for the income year is to be such a number as the Commissioner is satisfied would reduce the total amount of *exploration credits that could be created in that income year to the exploration credit cap for the income year.

     * (4) In ascertaining for the purposes of subsection (2) or (3) the total amount of *exploration credits that could be created in an income year (the **_current income year_**), the Commissioner is to:

      * (a) use the information provided in declarations under paragraph 41870(1)(b) for the previous income year; and

      * (b) disregard the possible application of any modulation factor.

     * (5) A failure to comply with subsection (2), (3) or (4) does not invalidate the declaration of a modulation factor for an income year.

     * (6) A declaration made under subsection (1) is a legislative instrument, but section 42 (disallowance) of the _Legislative Instruments Act 2003_ does not apply to the declaration.

##### 41895  Effect on tax losses of creating exploration credits

     * (1) If an entity creates any *exploration credits in respect of a *loss year, the amount of the entity's *tax loss for the loss year is reduced by the amount worked out as follows:

     * (2) However, if the amount worked out under subsection (1) equals or exceeds what would (apart from this section) be the entity's *tax loss for the *loss year, that tax loss is taken to be nil.

##### 4201  What this Division is about

     * This Division deals with amounts you can deduct, and amounts included in your assessable income, because of these situations:

      *  	you acquire a registered emissions unit;

      *  	you hold a registered emissions unit at the start or the end of the income year;

      *  	you dispose of a registered emissions unit.

##### Table of sections

       * 4205	The 4 key features of tax accounting for registered emissions units

##### 4205  The 4 key features of tax accounting for registered emissions units

     * The purpose of income tax accounting for registered emissions units is to produce the same tax treatment, irrespective of your purpose in acquiring or holding the registered emissions units.

     * There are 4 key features: 

     * (1) You bring your gross expenditure and gross proceeds to account, not your net profits and losses on disposal of a registered emissions unit.

     * (2) The gross expenditure is deductible.

     * (3) The gross proceeds are assessable income.

     * (4) You must bring to account any difference between the value of your registered emissions units held at the start and at the end of the income year. This is done in such a way that:

      * (a) any increase in value is included in assessable income; and

      * (b) any decrease in value is a deduction.

##### Subdivision 420A--Registered emissions units

##### Table of sections

       * 42010	Meaning of registered emissions unit

       * 42012	Meaning of hold a registered emissions unit

##### 42010  Meaning of registered emissions unit

     * A**_ registered emissions unit _**is:

      * (b) a *Kyoto unit; or

      * (d) an *Australian carbon credit unit;

     * for which there is an entry in a Registry account (within the meaning of the _Australian National Registry of Emissions Units Act 2011_).

##### 42012  Meaning of hold a registered emissions unit

     * (1) You **_hold_** a *registered emissions unit if you are the entity in whose Registry account (within the meaning of the _Australian National Registry of Emissions Units Act 2011_) there is an entry for the unit.

     * (2) However, if the entity (the **_nominee entity_**) in whose Registry account (within the meaning of the _Australian National Registry of Emissions Units Act 2011_) there is an entry for a *registered emissions unit holds the unit as nominee for another entity:

      * (a) the other entity is taken to **_hold_** the unit; and

      * (b) the nominee entity is taken not to hold the unit.

      * (b) an offsets report (within the meaning of that Act).

     * No deduction if sale proceeds would not be assessable

     * (5) You cannot deduct under this section expenditure you incur in becoming the *holder of a *registered emissions unit if, assuming that you had sold the unit to someone else immediately after you started to *hold the unit, the proceeds of the sale would not have been included in your assessable income under section 42025.

          * Note: Under the _International Tax Agreements Act 1953_, for some foreign residents, the proceeds of the sale of a registered emissions unit are not assessable income in Australia.

##### 42020  Nonarm's length transactions and transactions with associates

     * (1) If:

      * (a) an entity becomes the *holder of a *registered emissions unit; and

      * (b) either:

        * (i) the entity and the previous holder of the unit did not deal with each other at *arm's length; or

        * (ii) the previous holder is the entity's *associate; and

      * (b) *passes to a beneficiary in the individual's estate.

     * (3) This section does not apply to the issue of an *Australian carbon credit unit under the _Carbon Credits (Carbon Farming Initiative) Act 2011_.

##### 42021  Incoming international transfers of emissions units

     * Unit held as trading stock or as a revenue asset

     * (1) If:

      * (a) any of the following conditions is satisfied:

        * (iii) a *Kyoto unit is transferred from your foreign account (within the meaning of the _Australian National Registry of Emissions Units Act 2011_) to your Registry account (within the meaning of that Act) or your nominee's Registry account (within the meaning of that Act);

        * (iv) a Kyoto unit is transferred from your nominee's foreign account (within the meaning of the _Australian National Registry of Emissions Units Act 2011_) to your Registry account (within the meaning of that Act) or your nominee's Registry account (within the meaning of that Act);

        * (v) an *Australian carbon credit unit is transferred from your foreign account (within the meaning of the _Carbon Credits (Carbon Farming Initiative) Act 2011_) to your Registry account (within the meaning of the _Australian National Registry of Emissions Units Act 2011_) or your nominee's Registry account (within the meaning of the _Australian National Registry of Emissions Units Act 2011_);

        * (vi) an Australian carbon credit unit is transferred from your nominee's foreign account (within the meaning of the _Carbon Credits (Carbon Farming Initiative) Act 2011_) to your Registry account (within the meaning of the _Australian National Registry of Emissions Units Act 2011_) or your nominee's Registry account (within the meaning of the _Australian National Registry of Emissions Units Act 2011_); and

      * (b) as a result of the transfer, you start to *hold the unit as a *registered emissions unit; and

      * (c) just before the transfer, the unit was your *trading stock or *revenue asset;

     * you are treated as if: 

      * (d) just before the transfer, you had sold the unit to someone else for its *cost; and

      * (e) you had, immediately after the sale, bought it back as a registered emissions unit for the same amount.

          * Example: An Australian resident company carries on a business of trading in emissions units. The units are trading stock. The company owns 10,000 emission reduction units (a type of Kyoto unit) that are registered in New Zealand. 5,000 of those emission reduction units are transferred from the company's New Zealand registry account to the company's Australian registry account.

          * The company is treated as having sold each unit to someone else at its cost just before it became a registered emissions unit. As the unit was previously held as trading stock, the unit ceases to be trading stock (section 7012). The cost of the unit just before it became a registered emissions unit is included in the company's assessable income.

          * The company is also treated as having bought 5,000 registered emissions units for the same amount. The company is entitled to a deduction for that amount (section 42015).

     * Unit held otherwise than as trading stock or as a revenue asset

     * (2) If:

      * (a) any of the following conditions is satisfied:

        * (iii) a *Kyoto unit is transferred from your foreign account (within the meaning of the _Australian National Registry of Emissions Units Act 2011_) to your Registry account (within the meaning of that Act) or your nominee's Registry account (within the meaning of that Act);

        * (iv) a Kyoto unit is transferred from your nominee's foreign account (within the meaning of the _Australian National Registry of Emissions Units Act 2011_) to your Registry account (within the meaning of that Act) or your nominee's Registry account (within the meaning of that Act);

        * (v) an *Australian carbon credit unit is transferred from your foreign account (within the meaning of the _Carbon Credits (Carbon Farming Initiative) Act 2011_) to your Registry account (within the meaning of the _Australian National Registry of Emissions Units Act 2011_) or your nominee's Registry account (within the meaning of the _Australian National Registry of Emissions Units Act 2011_);

        * (vi) an Australian carbon credit unit is transferred from your nominee's foreign account (within the meaning of the _Carbon Credits (Carbon Farming Initiative) Act 2011_) to your Registry account (within the meaning of the _Australian National Registry of Emissions Units Act 2011_) or your nominee's Registry account (within the meaning of the _Australian National Registry of Emissions Units Act 2011_); and

      * (b) as a result of the transfer, you start to *hold the unit as a *registered emissions unit; and

      * (c) just before the transfer, the unit was neither your *trading stock nor your *revenue asset;

     * you are treated as if: 

      * (d) just before the transfer, you had sold the unit to someone else for its *market value just before the transfer; and

      * (e) you had, immediately after the sale, bought it back as a registered emissions unit for the same amount.

##### 42022  Becoming taxable in Australia on the proceeds of sale of registered emissions units

      * (a) you start to *hold a *registered emissions unit at a particular time; and

      * (b) assuming that you had sold the unit to someone else immediately after you started to hold the unit, the proceeds of the sale would not have been included in your assessable income under section 42025; and

      * (c) you hold the unit until a later time (the **_taxable status commencement time_**), where the following conditions are satisfied:

        * (i) assuming that you had sold the unit to someone else immediately before the taxable status commencement time, the proceeds of the sale would not have been included in your assessable income under section 42025;

        * (ii) assuming that you had sold the unit to someone else at the taxable status commencement time, the proceeds of the sale would have been included in your assessable income under section 42025;

     * you are treated as if: 

      * (d) immediately after the taxable status commencement time, you had bought the unit from someone else for its *market value; and

      * (e) you had started to hold the unit immediately after the taxable status commencement time instead of at the time mentioned in paragraph (a).

          * Note: Under the _International Tax Agreements Act 1953_, for some foreign residents, the proceeds of the sale of a registered emissions unit are not assessable income in Australia.

     * Source

     * (3) An amount included in your assessable income under subsection (1) is taken, for the purposes of the *income tax laws, to have a source in Australia.

##### 42030  Nonarm's length transactions and transactions with associates

     * If: 

      * (a) an entity (the **_transferor_**) ceases to *hold a *registered emissions unit; and

      * (b) the cessation is because of the transfer of the unit to:

        * (i) a Registry account (within the meaning of the _Australian National Registry of Emissions Units Act 2011_); or

        * (ii) a foreign account (within the meaning of that Act);

##### 42035  Outgoing international transfers of emissions units

     * If: 

      * (a) you stop *holding a *registered emissions unit; and

      * (b) you do so as a result of the transfer of the unit to:

        * (ii) if the unit is a *Kyoto unit--your foreign account (within the meaning of the _Australian National Registry of Emissions Units Act 2011_) or your nominee's foreign account (within the meaning of that Act); or

        * (iii) if the unit is an *Australian carbon credit unit--your foreign account (within the meaning of the _Carbon Credits (Carbon Farming Initiative) Act 2011_) or your nominee's foreign account (within the meaning of that Act);

     * you are treated as if: 

      * (c) just before the transfer, you had sold the unit to someone else for its *market value just before the transfer; and

      * (d) you had, immediately after the sale, bought it back for the same amount.

          * Example: An Australian resident company carries on a business of trading in emission units. The company owns 10,000 emission reduction units (a type of Kyoto unit) that are registered in Australia. 5,000 of those units are transferred from the company's Australian registry account to the company's New Zealand registry account.

          * The company is treated as having sold each unit to someone else at its market value just before it stopped being a registered emissions unit. As the unit was a registered emissions unit, the market value is included in the company's assessable income (section 42025).

          * The company is also treated as having bought 5,000 emission reduction units for the same amount. As those units are trading stock, the company may be able to deduct that amount under section 81.

##### 42040  Disposal of registered emissions units for a purpose other than gaining assessable income

        * (i) in gaining or producing the first entity's assessable income; nor

        * (ii) in carrying on a *business for the purpose of gaining or producing the first entity's assessable income; and

      * (e) section 42030 (nonarm's length transactions and transactions with associates) did not apply to the first entity ceasing to hold the unit;

     * the first entity's assessable income for that income year includes an amount equal to the amount the first entity has deducted or can deduct.

     * Death

     * (2) If:

      * (a) the first entity is an individual; and

     * Transfer--treatment of acquirer

     * (4) If:

      * (a) the cessation is because of the transfer of the unit to another entity; and

      * (b) neither subsection (2) nor (3) applies;

     * the other entity is treated as having bought the unit for the amount included in the first entity's assessable income under subsection (1).

     * (5) If subsection (4) applies to the transfer of the unit to another entity:

      * (a) the first entity must inform the other entity that, as a result of subsection (4) applying, the other entity is treated as having bought the unit for a particular amount; and

      * (b) the first entity must do so:

      * (a) the *value of all *registered emissions units you *held at the start of the income year; and

      * (b) the value of all registered emissions units you held at the end of the income year.

     * Increase in value is included in assessable income

     * (2) Your assessable income includes any excess of the *value at the end of the income year over the value at the start of the income year.

     * Decrease in value is a deduction

     * (3) On the other hand, you can deduct any excess of the *value at the start of the income year over the value at the end of the income year.

     * Source

     * (4) An amount included in your assessable income under subsection (2) is taken, for the purposes of the *income tax laws, to have a source in Australia.

     * Disregard value of unit if sale proceeds would not be assessable

     * (5) For the purposes of this Subdivision, disregard the *value of a *registered emissions unit you *held at the end of the income year if, assuming that you had sold the unit to someone else immediately after you started to hold the unit, the proceeds of the sale would not have been included in your assessable income under section 42025.

          * Note: Under the _International Tax Agreements Act 1953_, for some foreign residents, the proceeds of the sale of a registered emissions unit are not assessable income in Australia.

##### 42050  Value of registered emissions units at start of income year

     * (1) The **_value_** of a *registered emissions unit you *held at the start of an income year is the same amount at which it was taken into account under this Subdivision at the end of the last income year.

     * (2) The **_value_** of the unit is a nil amount if the unit was not taken into account under this Subdivision at the end of the last income year.

##### 42051  Valuation methods

     * The **_value_** of a *registered emissions unit you *held at the end of an income year is worked out using one of the following methods:

      * (a) the *FIFO cost method;

      * (b) the *actual cost method;

      * (c) the *market value method.

     * Sections 42055 and 42057 tell you which method applies.

##### 42052  FIFO cost method of working out the value of units

     * The **_FIFO cost method _**for working out the *value of the *registered emissions units you *held at the end of an income year means that the value of the units is the *cost of the registered emissions units, and, for the purposes of the application of this Subdivision to you for the income year:

      * (a) if any of the registered emissions units are:

        * (ii) eligible international emissions units (within the meaning of the _Australian National Registry of Emissions Units Act 2011_); or

        * (iii) *Australian carbon credit units;

      * you must account for those units on a firstin firstout basis; and

      * (c) if any of the registered emissions units are *Kyoto units that are not eligible international emissions units (within the meaning of the _Australian National Registry of Emissions Units Act 2011_)--you must account for those units on a firstin firstout basis.

##### 42053  Actual cost method of working out the value of units

     * The **_actual cost method_** for working out the value of the *registered emissions units you *held at the end of the income year means that the value of the units is the *cost of the units, and, for the purposes of the application of this Subdivision to you for the income year, you must not account for any of those units on a firstin firstout basis.

##### 42054  Market value method of working out the value of units

     * The **_market value method_** for working out the value of the *registered emissions units you *held at the end of the income year means that the value of the units is the *market value of the units at the end of the income year.

##### 42055  Valuation method for first income year at the end of which you held registered emissions units

     * Scope

     * (1) This section applies if:

     * (2) You may choose one of the following methods:

      * (a) the *FIFO cost method;

      * (b) the *actual cost method;

      * (c) the *market value method;

     * for working out the **_value_** of the *registered emissions units you *held at the end of the income year.

     * FIFO cost method applies if no choice made

     * (3) If you do not make a choice under subsection (2) for the income year, the **_value_** of the *registered emissions units you *held at the end of the income year is worked out using the *FIFO cost method.

     * Time for making choice

     * (4) You must make a choice under subsection (2) before you lodge your *income tax return for the income year for which you make the choice.

     * No revocation of choice

     * (5) A choice made under subsection (2) cannot be revoked.

##### 42057  Valuation method for later income years at the end of which you held registered emissions units

     * Scope

     * (1) This section applies if:

      * (a) you *held one or more *registered emissions units at the end of an income year (the **_current income year_**); and

      * (b) the current income year is not the first income year at the end of which you held one or more registered emissions units.

     * Choice of method

     * (2) You may choose one of the following methods:

      * (a) the *FIFO cost method;

      * (b) the *actual cost method;

      * (c) the *market value method;

     * for working out the **_value_** of the *registered emissions units you *held at the end of the current income year.

     * Previous method applies if no choice made

     * (3) If you do not make a choice under subsection (2) for the current income year, the **_value_** of the *registered emissions units you *held at the end of the current income year is worked out using the method that applied to the most recent income year at the end of which you held one or more registered emissions units.

     * Limitation on choice--before 201516 income year

     * (4) If the current income year is before the 201516 income year, you must not make a choice under subsection (2) for the current income year if you have previously made a choice under that subsection for an earlier income year.

     * Limitation on choice--201516 income year or a later income year

     * (5) If the current income year is:

      * (a) the 201516 income year; or

      * (b) a later income year;

     * you must not make a choice under subsection (2) for the current income year unless:

      * (c) the same method applied for each of the 4 most recent income years at the end of which you *held one or more *registered emissions units; and

      * (d) the method mentioned in paragraph (c) is different from the method to which your choice for the current income year relates.

     * Limitation on choice--change from FIFO cost method to actual cost method

     * (6) You must not choose under subsection (2) the *actual cost method for the current income year if the *FIFO cost method applied for the most recent income year at the end of which you *held one or more *registered emissions units.

     * Time for making choice

     * (7) You must make a choice under subsection (2) before you lodge your *income tax return for the income year for which you make the choice.

     * No revocation of choice

     * (8) A choice made under subsection (2) cannot be revoked.

##### 42060  Cost of registered emissions units

     * Australian carbon credit units

     * (3) If an *Australian carbon credit unit was issued to you under the _Carbon Credits (Carbon Farming Initiative) Act 2011_, the **_cost_** of the unit is its *market value immediately after you began to *hold the unit.

     * Other registered emissions units

     * (4) The **_cost_** of a *registered emissions unit (other than an *Australian carbon credit unit to which subsection (3) applies) is the total of the expenditure that you:

      * (a) incurred in becoming the *holder of the unit; and

      * (b) can deduct under section 42015.
