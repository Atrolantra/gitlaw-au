        * Step 1.	Work out the sum of the amounts that the partner has contributed (the **_partner's contribution_**) to the partnership.

        * Step 2.	Subtract the sum of all the amounts (if any) of the partner's contribution that are repaid to the partner.

        * Step 3.	Subtract the sum of all deductions allowed to the partner for losses of the partnership in previous years of income.

        * Step 4.	Subtract the sum of the amounts of all the debt interests issued by the partner to the extent that they are secured by the partner's interest in the partnership.

          * Example: A limited partner contributes $100,000 to a VCLP, having borrowed $80,000. Because the lender values the partner's interest in the partnership at $70,000, the partner also provides, as additional security, other assets valued at $10,000.

          * If none of the partner's contribution has been repaid and the partner has not been allowed deductions for partnership losses in previous years of income, the amount allowable to the partner for a partnership loss cannot exceed $30,000.

      * (2A) Subsection (2) does not apply to a partnership loss if the partner's interest in the partnership at the end of the year of income is:

       * (a) a segregated exempt asset (as defined in the _Income Tax Assessment Act 1997_) of a life assurance company; or

       * (b) a segregated current pension asset (as defined in the _Income Tax Assessment Act 1997_) of a complying superannuation fund.

      * (3) The exempt income of a partner in a partnership shall include:

       * (a) so much of the individual interest of the partner in the exempt income of the partnership of the year of income as is attributable to a period when the partner was a resident; and

       * (b) so much of the individual interest of the partner in the exempt income of the partnership of the year of income as is attributable to a period when the partner was not a resident and is also attributable to sources in .

      * (4) The nonassessable nonexempt income of a partner in a partnership shall include:

       * (a) so much of the individual interest of the partner in the nonassessable nonexempt income of the partnership of the year of income as is attributable to a period when the partner was a resident; and

       * (b) so much of the individual interest of the partner in the nonassessable nonexempt income of the partnership of the year of income as is attributable to a period when the partner was not a resident and is also attributable to sources in .

##### 92A  Deductions in respect of outstanding subsection 92(2AA) amounts

      * (1) If:

       * (a) the partner is a limited partner in a partnership; and

       * (b) the partnership is a VCLP, an ESVCLP, an AFOF or a VCMP during the year of income; and

       * (c) the amount allowable under subsection 92(2) as a deduction to the partner for partnership losses incurred by the partnership in the year of income is not reduced because of subsection 92(2AA); and

       * (d) the partner has an outstanding subsection 92(2AA) amount for the year of income;

      * there is allowable as a deduction to the partnership an amount worked out as follows: 

Method statement

        * Step 1.	Subtract the amount allowable under subsection 92(2) as a deduction to the partner for partnership losses incurred by the partnership in the year of income from the amount worked out using the method statement in subsection 92(2AA).

        * Step 2.	If the amount worked out under step 1 is greater than or equal to the outstanding subsection 92(2AA) amount for the year of income, the amount of the deduction allowable under this section is the outstanding subsection 92(2AA) amount.

        * Step 3.	If the amount worked out under step 1 is less than the outstanding subsection 92(2AA) amount for the year of income, the amount of the deduction allowable under this section is the amount worked out under step 1.

      * (2) The partner has an outstanding subsection 92(2AA) amount for a year of income if:

       * (a) an amount allowable under subsection 92(2) as a deduction to the partner for partnership losses incurred by the partnership in a previous year of income was reduced because of subsection 92(2AA); and

       * (b) the difference between:

        * (i) the sum of all reductions made under subsection 92(2AA) to amounts allowable under subsection 92(2) as deductions to the partner for partnership losses incurred by the partnership in previous years of income; and

        * (ii) the sum of all amounts allowable under this section, in respect of previous years of income, as deductions to the partner in relation to those reductions;

       * is greater than zero.

      * The amount of that difference is the partner's **_outstanding subsection 92(2AA) amount_** for the year of income.

      * (3) To avoid doubt, a partner's outstanding subsection 92(2AA) amount for a year of income cannot form part of a tax loss for the purposes of Division 36 of the _Income Tax Assessment Act 1997_.

##### 94  Partner not having control and disposal of share in partnership income

      * (1) Subject to this section, where:

       * (a) a share in the net income of a partnership of a year of income is included in the assessable income of a partner in the partnership, not being:

        * (i) a company;

        * (ii) a person in the capacity of a trustee; or

        * (iii) a person who was under the age of 18 years on the last day of the year of income of the person that corresponds with the year of income of the partnership; and

       * (b) the partnership is so constituted or controlled, or its operations are so conducted, that the partner has not the real and effective control and disposal of that share or of a part of that share;

      * this section applies to that share or that part of that share, as the case may be.

      * (2) Subject to the succeeding provisions of this section, where:

       * (a) a partnership is so constituted or controlled, or its operations are so conducted, that a partner in the partnership, being a trustee of a trust estate, has not the real and effective control and disposal of his or her share in the net income of the partnership of a year of income or of a part of that share (which share or part of a share, as the case may be, is in this subsection referred to as **_uncontrolled partnership income_**); and

       * (b) in calculating in accordance with section 95 the net income of that trust estate or of any other trust estate, there is included in the assessable income of the trust estate any uncontrolled partnership income;

      * then: 

       * (c) if:

        * (i) a beneficiary, not being a company or a person who was under the age of 18 years on the last day of the year of income of the person that corresponds with the year of income of the partnership, is presently entitled to the whole of the income of the trust estate otherwise than in the capacity of a trustee; or

        * (ii) there is no part of the net income of the trust estate that is included in the assessable income of a beneficiary in pursuance of section 97 or in respect of which the trustee is assessed and liable to pay tax in pursuance of section 98;

       * this section applies to the portion of the net income of the trust estate that was derived from uncontrolled partnership income;

       * (d) if a beneficiary, not being a company or a person who was under the age of 18 years on the last day of the year of income of the person that corresponds with the year of income of the partnership, is presently entitled to a share of the income of the trust estate otherwise than in the capacity of a trustee, this section applies to so much of that share of the net income of the trust estate as bears to that share the same proportion as the portion of the net income of the trust estate that was derived from uncontrolled partnership income bears to the net income of the trust estate; and

       * (e) if there is a part of the net income of the trust estate that is not included in the assessable income of a beneficiary in pursuance of section 97 and in respect of which the trustee is not assessed and is not liable to pay tax in pursuance of section 98, this section applies to so much of that part of the net income of the trust estate as bears to that part the same proportion as the portion of the net income of the trust estate that was derived from uncontrolled partnership income bears to the net income of the trust estate.

      * (5) For the purposes of this section:

       * (a) where:

        * (i) the assessable income of a trust estate includes the net income or a share of the net income of another trust estate; and

        * (ii) the assessable income of the other trust estate by reference to which that net income is calculated included income of a particular class (including an amount that is to be deemed by an application or applications of this paragraph to be income of a particular class);

       * the assessable income of the firstmentioned trust estate shall be deemed to include income of that class of an amount equal to so much of the net income or share of the net income of the other trust estate that is included in the assessable income of the firstmentioned trust estate as bears to that net income or share of that net income the same proportion as the portion of the net income of the other trust estate that was derived from income of that class bears to the net income of the other trust estate; and

       * (b) the portion of the net income of a trust estate that is derived from income of a particular class that is included in the assessable income of the trust estate is the amount remaining after deducting from the income of that class that is included in the assessable income of the trust estate:

        * (i) any prescribed deductions that relate exclusively to that income of that class;

        * (ii) so much of any other prescribed deductions (other than apportionable deductions) as, in the opinion of the Commissioner, may appropriately be related to that income of that class; and

        * (iii) the amount that bears to the prescribed deductions (being apportionable deductions) the same proportion as the amount that, but for this subparagraph, would be the portion of the net income of the trust estate that is derived from that income of that class bears to the sum of the net income of the trust estate and those lastmentioned prescribed deductions.

      * (6) Where the assessable income of a trust estate includes, or, by virtue of paragraph (5)(a), is to be deemed to include, income of a particular class but the Commissioner is of the opinion that it would be unreasonable to treat each part or share of the net income of the trust estate that is included in the assessable income of a beneficiary, or on or in respect of which the trustee is assessed and liable to pay tax, as including a proportionate part of the portion of the net income of the trust estate that is derived from income of that class, the amount:

       * (a) that is the amount of a part or share of the net income of the trust estate to which this section applies by virtue of paragraph (2)(d) or (e); or

       * (b) that is, by virtue of paragraph (5)(a), the amount of the income of that class that is to be deemed to be included in the assessable income of another trust estate;

      * is, in lieu of the amount that, but for this subsection, would be the amount of that part or share of that net income or the amount of that income of that class, as the case may be, such amount as the Commissioner considers reasonable in the circumstances.

      * (8) Where the Commissioner is of the opinion that, by reason of special circumstances, it would be unreasonable that this section should apply to any income, this section does not apply to that income.

      * (8A) In forming an opinion for the purposes of subsection (8) as to whether it is unreasonable that this section should apply in relation to any of the net income of a trust estate, the Commissioner shall take into consideration the extent (if any) to which that net income represents income to which a beneficiary is presently entitled that is attributable to a period when the beneficiary was not a resident and is also attributable to sources out of Australia.

      * (9) Where the assessable income of a taxpayer, other than a taxpayer in the capacity of a trustee, includes income to which this section applies, the taxpayer shall be assessed and is liable to pay further tax, in accordance with subsection (10A) or (10B), upon the portion (in this section referred to as the **_eligible portion_**) of his or her taxable income that is derived from income to which this section applies.

      * (10) For the purposes of subsection (9), the portion of the taxable income of a taxpayer that is derived from income to which this section applies is the amount remaining after deducting from the income to which this section applies that is included in his or her assessable income:

       * (a) any deductions allowed or allowable in his or her assessment that relate exclusively to the income to which this section applies that is included in his or her assessable income;

       * (b) so much of any other deductions allowed or allowable in his or her assessment (other than apportionable deductions) as, in the opinion of the Commissioner, may appropriately be related to the income to which this section applies that is included in his or her assessable income; and

       * (c) the amount that bears to the apportionable deductions allowed or allowable in his or her assessment the same proportion as the amount that, but for this paragraph, would be the portion of his or her taxable income that is derived from income to which this section applies bears to the sum of his or her taxable income and those apportionable deductions.

        * (i) in a case to which subparagraph (ii) does not apply--the sum of:

##### 94C  Continuity of limited partnership not affected by changes in composition

      * For the purposes of this Division, a change in the composition of a limited partnership does not affect the continuity of the partnership.

##### Subdivision B--Corporate limited partnerships

##### 94D  Corporate limited partnerships

      * (1) For the purposes of this Division, a limited partnership is a corporate limited partnership in relation to a year of income of the partnership if:

       * (a) the year of income is the 199596 year of income or a later year of income; or

       * (b) the partnership was formed on or after 19 August 1992; or

       * (c) both:

        * (i) the partnership was formed before 19 August 1992; and

        * (ii) the partnership does not pass the continuity of business test set out in section 94E; or

       * (d) all of the following apply:

        * (i) the partnership was formed before 19 August 1992;

        * (ii) a change in the composition of the partnership occurs during the period:

           * (A) beginning on 19 August 1992; and

           * (B) ending at the end of the year of income;

        * (iii) the partners do not elect, in accordance with section 94F, that the partnership is not to be treated as a corporate limited partnership in relation to the year of income.

      * (2) However, a partnership that is a VCLP, an ESVCLP, an AFOF or a venture capital management partnership cannot be a corporate limited partnership.

          * Note 1: This subsection can apply without the partnership meeting the applicable registration requirements under the _Venture Capital Act 2002_. It must be registered under that Act in order to be a VCLP, an ESVCLP or an AFOF, but it is possible for it to remain registered while the requirements are not met.

          * Note 2: VCLPs, ESVCLPs, AFOFs and VCMPs are taxed as ordinary partnerships under Division 5.

          * Note 3: If the partnership's registration as a VCLP, ESVCLP or AFOF is unconditional, some partners' share in capital gains and losses from CGT events relating to some investments may be disregarded: see Subdivision 118F of the _Income Tax Assessment Act 1997_.

      * (3) A **_venture capital management partnership_** is a limited partnership that:

       * (a) is a general partner of one or more of the following:

        * (i) one or more VCLPs;

        * (ia) one or more ESVCLPs;

        * (ii) one or more AFOFs; and

       * (b) only carries on activities that are related to being such a general partner.

      * A limited partnership ceases to be a venture capital management partnership if it ceases to meet the requirements of paragraphs (a) and (b).

          * Note: In this Act, the term "venture capital management partnership" is usually abbreviated to "VCMP".

      * (4) The place of residence of a VCMP is the place at which the partnership has its central management and control.

      * (5) A limited partnership that is a foreign hybrid limited partnership in relation to a year of income because of subsection 83010(1) of the _Income Tax Assessment Act 1997_ is not a corporate limited partnership in relation to the year of income.

          * Note: As result, both the normal partnership provisions and special provisions relating to foreign hybrid limited partnerships will apply to the entity.

      * (6) If, for the purpose of applying this Act and the _Income Tax Assessment Act 1997_ in relation to a partner's interest in a limited partnership, the partnership is a foreign hybrid limited partnership in relation to a year of income because of subsection 83010(2) of that Act, the partnership is not a corporate limited partnership in relation to the partner's interest in relation to the year of income.

          * Note: As result, both the normal partnership provisions and special provisions relating to foreign hybrid limited partnerships will apply to the entity, but only in relation to the partner's interest.

##### 94E  Continuity of business test

      * In determining whether a limited partnership is a corporate limited partnership in relation to a year of income, the partnership passes the continuity of business test if, and only if:

       * (a) at all times during the period:

        * (i) beginning on 19 August 1992; and

        * (ii) ending at the end of the year of income;

       * the partnership carried on the same business as it carried on immediately before the beginning of that period; and

       * (b) the partnership did not, at any time during that period, derive income from a business of a kind that it did not carry on, or from a transaction of a kind that it had not entered into in the course of its business operations, before that period.

##### 94F  Change in composition of limited partnership--election that partnership not be treated as an eligible limited partnership

      * An election referred to in paragraph 94D(1)(d) in relation to a limited partnership and in relation to a year of income has no effect unless:

       * (a) the partnership passes the continuity of ownership test set out in section 94G; and

       * (b) the election is made:

        * (i) within 6 months after the end of the later of the following years of income:

           * (A) the year of income to which the election relates;

           * (B) the year of income in which the _Taxation Laws Amendment Act (No. 6) 1992 _received the Royal Assent; or

#### Division 6--Trust income

##### 95AAA  Simplified outline of the relationship between this Division, Division 6E and Subdivisions 115C and 207B of the Income Tax Assessment Act 1997

      * The following is a simplified outline of the relationship between this Division, Division 6E and Subdivisions 115C and 207B of the _Income Tax Assessment Act 1997_.

      * This Division sets out the basic income tax treatment of the net income of the trust estate. Generally:

          * (a) it has the result of assessing beneficiaries on a share of the net income of the trust estate based on their present entitlement to a share of the income of the trust estate; and

          * (b) it has the result of assessing the trustee directly on any residual net income; and

          * (c) as a collection mechanism, it has the result of assessing the trustee in respect of some beneficiaries, such as nonresidents or those under a legal disability.

      * If the trust estate has capital gains, franked distributions or franking credits, this basic treatment is modified as described below.

      * Division 6E modifies the operation of this Division for the purpose of excluding amounts relevant to capital gains, franked distributions and franking credits from the calculations of assessable amounts under sections 97, 98, 99, 99A and 100.

      * Division 6E does not modify the operation of this Division (or any other provision of this Act) for any other purpose. For example:

          * (a) it does not modify the operation of this Division for the purposes of applying section 100A; and

          * (b) it does not modify amounts taxed in the hands of the trustee under Subdivisions 115C and 207B of the _Income Tax Assessment Act 1997_.

      * Subdivisions 115C and 207B of the _Income Tax Assessment Act 1997_ provide the corresponding taxation treatment for those capital gains, franked distributions and franking credits. Specifically:

          * (a) Subdivision 115C of that Act has the effect that an amount corresponding to each of those capital gains is taxed in the hands of the beneficiaries of the trust (as a capital gain) and, if necessary, assessed to the trustee.

          * (b) Subdivision 207B of that Act has the effect that an amount corresponding to each of those franked distributions is taxed in the hands of the beneficiaries of the trust and, if necessary, the trustee. It also has the effect that the entity in whose hands those distributions are taxed can take advantage of the relevant amount of related franking credits.

##### 95AAB  Adjustments under Subdivision 115C or 207B of the Income Tax Assessment Act 1997--references in this Act to assessable income under section 97, 98A or 100

      * (1) Subsection (2) applies if an amount is included in the assessable income of a beneficiary of a trust estate because of Subdivision 115C or 207B of the _Income Tax Assessment Act 1997_.

      * (2) For the purposes of a provision of this Act (other than a provision mentioned in subsection (3)), treat the amount as being included in the beneficiary's assessable income in relation to the net income of the trust estate under section 97, 98A or 100 (as the case requires).

      * (3) The provisions are as follows:

       * (a) sections 97, 98A (other than subsection 98A(2)) and 100 (other than subsections 100(2) and (3));

       * (b) sections 98, 99 and 99A;

       * (c) Subdivisions 115C and 207B of the _Income Tax Assessment Act 1997_.

      * (4) To avoid doubt, subsection (2) applies despite subsection 6(1AA).

##### 95AAC  Adjustments under Subdivision 115C or 207B of the Income Tax Assessment Act 1997--references in this Act to liabilities under section 98, 99 or 99A

      * (1) Subsection (2) applies if an amount in respect of which a trustee of a trust estate is liable to be assessed (and pay tax) under section 98 in respect of the beneficiary is increased because of Subdivision 115C or 207B of the _Income Tax Assessment Act 1997_.

      * (2) For the purposes of a provision of this Act (other than a provision mentioned in subsection (5)), treat the amount of the increase as being an amount in respect of which the trustee is liable to be assessed (and pay tax) under section 98 in respect of the beneficiary's interest in or share of the net income of the trust estate.

      * (3) Subsection (4) applies if an amount in respect of which a trustee of a trust estate is liable to be assessed (and pay tax) under section 99 or 99A is increased because of Subdivision 115C or 207B of the _Income Tax Assessment Act 1997_.

      * (4) For the purposes of a provision of this Act (other than a provision mentioned in subsection (5)), treat the amount of the increase as being an amount in respect of which the trustee is liable to be assessed (and pay tax) under section 99 or 99A in respect of the net income of the trust estate.

      * (5) The provisions are as follows:

       * (a) sections 97, 98A (other than subsection 98A(2)) and 100 (other than subsections 100(2) and (3));

       * (b) sections 98, 99 and 99A;

       * (c) Subdivisions 115C and 207B of the _Income Tax Assessment Act 1997_.

      * (6) To avoid doubt, subsections (2) and (4) apply despite subsection 6(1AA).

##### 95  Interpretation

      * (1) In this Division:

      * **_adjusted Division 6 percentage_**, of an entity that is a beneficiary or trustee of a trust estate, means the entity's Division 6 percentage of the income of the trust estate calculated on the assumption that the amount of a capital gain or franked distribution to which any beneficiary or the trustee of the trust estate is specifically entitled were disregarded in working out the income of the trust estate.

      * **_adjusted net income_**, in relation to a trust estate, has the meaning given by subsection 100AB(4).

      * **_Division 6 percentage_**:

       * (a) a beneficiary of a trust estate has a **_Division 6 percentage_** of the income of the trust estate equal to the share (expressed as a percentage) of the income of the trust estate to which the beneficiary is presently entitled; and

       * (b) the trustee of a trust estate has a **_Division 6 percentage_** of the income of the trust estate equal to the share (expressed as a percentage) of the income of the trust estate to which no beneficiary is presently entitled.

      * However, if the income of a trust estate is nil:

       * (c) a beneficiary of a trust estate has a **_Division 6 percentage_** of the income of the trust estate of 0%; and

       * (d) the trustee of a trust estate has a **_Division 6 percentage_** of the income of the trust estate of 100%.

      * **_exempt income_**, in relation to a trust estate, means the exempt income of the trust estate calculated as if the trustee were a taxpayer who was a resident.

          * Note: See also Division 54 of the _Income Tax Assessment Act 1997_ (in particular, the provisions in section 5470 about trusts), which provides a tax exemption for certain payments under structured settlements and structured orders.

      * **_net income_**, in relation to a trust estate, means the total assessable income of the trust estate calculated under this Act as if the trustee were a taxpayer in respect of that income and were a resident, less all allowable deductions, except deductions under Division 393 of the _Income Tax Assessment Act 1997_ (Farm management deposits) and except also, in respect of any beneficiary who has no beneficial interest in the corpus of the trust estate, or in respect of any life tenant, the deductions allowable under Division 36 of the _Income Tax Assessment Act 1997_ in respect of such of the tax losses of previous years as are required to be met out of corpus.

          * A trust may be required to work out its net income in a special way by Division 266 or 267 in Schedule 2F to this Act or Division 275 of the _Income Tax Assessment Act 1997_.

      * **_nonassessable nonexempt income_**, in relation to a trust estate, means the nonassessable nonexempt income of the trust estate calculated as if the trustee were a taxpayer who was a resident.

      * **_specifically entitled _**has the same meaning as in the _Income Tax Assessment Act 1997_.

      * (2) For the purposes of this Division, a trust estate shall be taken to be a resident trust estate in relation to a year of income if:

       * (a) a trustee of the trust estate was a resident at any time during the year of income; or

       * (b) the central management and control of the trust estate was in  at any time during the year of income.

      * (3) In this Division, a trust estate that is not a resident trust estate in relation to a year of income is referred to as a nonresident trust estate in relation to that year of income.

##### 95AA  Division does not apply in relation to FHSA trust

      * This Division does not apply in relation to a trust estate that is an FHSA trust.

##### 95AB  Modifications for special disability trusts

      * (1) This Division applies with the modifications set out in this section in relation to a year of income in relation to a trust estate that is a special disability trust at the end of the year of income.

      * (2) Treat the principal beneficiary of the trust estate as being presently entitled to all of the income of the trust estate of the year of income.

      * (3) If the principal beneficiary of the trust estate is a resident of Australia at the end of the year of income treat that person as being under a legal disability throughout the year of income.

      * (4) If there is no income of the trust estate assume that:

       * (a) there is income of the trust estate of the year of income; and

       * (b) the principal beneficiary of the trust estate is presently entitled to all of the income of the trust estate of the year of income.

      * (5) If the amount to be deducted under subsection 100(2) from the income tax assessed against the principal beneficiary is greater than the amount of the income tax assessed against the principal beneficiary, the Commissioner must pay to the principal beneficiary an amount equal to the difference between those 2 amounts.

          * Note: The tax offset is subject to the refundable tax offset rules: see section 6723 of the _Income Tax Assessment Act 1997_.

##### 95A  Special provisions relating to present entitlement

      * (1) For the purposes of this Act, where a beneficiary of a trust estate is presently entitled to any income of the trust estate, the beneficiary shall be taken to continue to be presently entitled to that income notwithstanding that the income is paid to, or applied for the benefit of, the beneficiary.

      * (2) For the purposes of this Act, where a beneficiary has a vested and indefeasible interest in any of the income of a trust estate but is not presently entitled to that income, the beneficiary shall be deemed to be presently entitled to that income of the trust estate.

       * (a) there shall be deducted from the income tax assessed against the beneficiary the amount (in this subsection referred to as the **_relevant amount_**) of the tax paid by the trustee in respect of the beneficiary's interest in the net income of the trust estate; and

       * (b) if the relevant amount is greater than the amount of the income tax assessed against the beneficiary--the Commissioner shall pay to the beneficiary an amount equal to the difference between those 2 amounts.

          * Note: See Division 3A of Part IIB of the _Taxation Administration Act 1953_ for the rules about how the Commissioner must pay the entity. Division 3 of Part IIB allows the Commissioner to apply the amount owing as a credit against tax debts that the entity owes to the Commonwealth.

      * (3) If a beneficiary of a trust estate who is presently entitled to a share of the income of the trust estate:

       * (a) is not, in respect of that share of the income of the trust estate, a beneficiary in the capacity of a trustee of another trust estate; and

       * (b) is a nonresident at the end of the year of income;

      * the assessable income of the beneficiary includes so much of the individual interest of the beneficiary in the net income of the trust estate as is reasonably attributable to a part of the net income of another trust estate in respect of which the trustee of the other trust estate is assessed and is liable to pay tax under subsection 98(4).

      * (4) To the extent that subsection (3) includes an amount in the assessable income of a beneficiary of a trust estate, the amount is not included by subsection (1) or section 100.

##### 98B  Deduction from beneficiary's tax

      * (1) This section applies to a beneficiary of a trust estate for a year of income if the assessable income of the beneficiary of the year of income includes an amount covered by subsection (2).

      * (2) This subsection covers an amount (the **_assessable amount_**) if:

       * (a) the amount is included in the assessable income of the beneficiary under one of the following:

        * (i) section 97;

        * (ii) subsection 98A(3);

        * (iii) section 100; and

       * (b) the amount does not represent income of the trust estate to which the beneficiary is presently entitled in the capacity of a trustee of another trust estate; and

       * (c) the amount is reasonably attributable to an amount (the **_taxed net income_**) in respect of which the trustee of another trust estate is assessed and liable to pay tax (the **_subsection 98(4) tax_**) under subsection 98(4).

      * (3) A proportion of the subsection 98(4) tax is to be deducted from the income tax assessed against the beneficiary of the year of income. That proportion is the same as the proportion of the taxed net income that gave rise to the assessable amount.

          * Note: To work out the proportion of the taxed net income that gives rise to assessable income for a beneficiary of another trust estate, you would have regard to the share of the income of each interposed trust estate to which a beneficiary (including a beneficiary in the capacity of a trustee) is presently entitled.

          * Example: The P Trust has two nonresident trustee beneficiaries, the trustees of the S Trust and the H Trust. Each trustee is presently entitled to a 1/2 share of the income of the P Trust. The net income of the P Trust is $100,000. The trustee of the P Trust pays tax of $22,500 under subsection 98(4) in respect of the trustee of the S Trust's interest and $22,500 under subsection 98(4) in respect of the trustee of the H Trust's interest.

          * The S Trust has a nonresident beneficiary, G, who is presently entitled to a 1/3 share of the income of the S Trust. The net income of the S Trust is $30,000. Subsection 98A(3) includes $10,000 in G's assessable income.

          * The taxed net income of the P trust is $50,000. The proportion of that taxed net income that gave rise to the $10,000 being included in G's assessable income i/3.This is because G had a 1/3 share of the income of the S Trust. $7,500 (1/3 x $22,500) is deducted from the income tax assessed against G.

          * If section 97, subsection 98A(3) or section 100 also includes amounts in the assessable income of any beneficiaries of the H Trust, each of those beneficiaries also works out the amount of the deduction against the income tax assessed against them in the same way.

      * (4) If the amount to be deducted under subsection (3) is greater than the amount of the income tax assessed against the beneficiary, the Commissioner must pay to the beneficiary an amount equal to the difference between those 2 amounts.

          * Note: See Division 3A of Part IIB of the _Taxation Administration Act 1953_ for the rules about how the Commissioner must pay the entity. Division 3A of Part IIB allows the Commissioner to apply the amount owing as a credit against tax debts that the entity owes to the Commonwealth.

      * (11) For the purposes of the application of this section to a taxpayer, the assessment year of income is:

       * (a) a taxpayer is a full selfassessment taxpayer for the assessment year of income; and

       * (b) the taxpayer lodges a return for that year;

      * then: 

       * (c) the Commissioner is taken to have made an assessment of the interest payable by the taxpayer under this section for the year, equal to the amount specified in the return as the interest so payable; and

            * Note: If any interest is so payable, the return must specify the amount: see section 161AA.

       * (d) the assessment is taken to have been made on the day on which the return is lodged; and

      * (4) A beneficiary of the trust estate has an amount of a **_Division 6E present entitlement to the income of the trust estate_** that is equal to the amount of the beneficiary's present entitlement to the income of the trust estate, decreased by:

       * (a) for each capital gain taken into account as mentioned in paragraph 102UW(b)--so much of the beneficiary's share of the capital gain as was included in the income of the trust estate; and

       * (b) for each franked distribution taken into account as mentioned in paragraph 102UW(b)--so much of the beneficiary's share of the franked distribution as was included in the income of the trust estate.

       * (a) **_share _**of a capital gain (see section 115227 of that Act);

       * (b) **_share _**of a franked distribution (see section 20755 of that Act).

       * (a) at all times during the year of income the voting power in the firstmentioned company was controlled, or was capable of being controlled, by a listed company or listed companies, either directly or through one or more companies, trustees or partnerships interposed between the firstmentioned company and the listed company or listed companies;

       * (b) at all times during the year of income a listed company or listed companies had a right to receive, either directly or through one or more companies, trustees or partnerships interposed between the firstmentioned company and the listed company or listed companies, more than onehalf of any dividends that might be paid by the firstmentioned company and more than onehalf of any distribution that might be made of capital of the firstmentioned company;

       * (c) at no time during the year of income was a person or were 2 or more persons in a position to affect rights of the listed company or listed companies in connexion with the firstmentioned company so as to prevent the listed company or listed companies from exercising for its or their own benefit control of the voting power in the firstmentioned company or from receiving for its or their own benefit more than onehalf of any dividends that might be paid by the firstmentioned company or of any distribution that might be made of capital of the firstmentioned company; and

       * (d) no agreement was entered into before or during the year of income by virtue of which a person or 2 or more persons would be in a position after the year of income so to affect rights of the listed company or listed companies in connexion with the firstmentioned company.

      * (4C) For the purposes of paragraphs (4B)(c) and (d), a person shall be taken to have been, or to be, in a position at a particular time to affect any rights of a listed company or listed companies in connexion with another company if at that time that person had, or has, a right, power or option (whether by virtue of any provision in the constituent document of the other company or of any company interposed between the listed company or listed companies and the other company or by virtue of any agreement or instrument or otherwise) to acquire those rights or to do an act or thing that would prevent the listed company or listed companies from exercising those rights for its or their own benefit or receiving any benefits accruing by reason of those rights.

      * (4D) A company (in this subsection and subsection (4E) referred to as **_the company concerned_**) that would, apart from this subsection, be a subsidiary of a public company for the purposes of this section in relation to the year of income shall be deemed, for the purposes of this section, not to be a subsidiary of a public company in relation to the year of income if the Commissioner is satisfied that:

       * (a) where the company concerned would, apart from this subsection, be such a subsidiary in relation to the year of income by virtue of subsection (4)--the affairs of the company concerned were managed or conducted in the year of income in the interests of persons other than the relevant holding company or holding companies; or

       * (b) where the company concerned would, apart from this subsection, be such a subsidiary in relation to the year of income by virtue of subsection (4B)--the affairs of the company concerned were managed or conducted in the year of income without proper regard to the interests of the relevant holding company or holding companies.

      * (4E) In considering whether the affairs of the company concerned were managed or conducted in the year of income as mentioned in subsection (4D), the Commissioner shall have regard to:

       * (a) the circumstances in which the relevant holding company or holding companies acquired a direct or indirect beneficial interest or interests in shares in the company concerned (whether the interest was, or the interests were, acquired before or during the year of income) and, in particular, whether those circumstances were capable of explanation by reference to ordinary commercial dealing;

       * (b) the provisions of the constituent document of the company concerned as in force during the year of income that related to the management or conduct of the affairs of that company, including the provisions of the constituent document that related to the appointment or removal of directors, the issue, allotment or redemption of shares, the grant, withdrawal or variation of rights in respect of shares, the payment of dividends and the investment or other application of moneys of that company;

       * (c) the nature and extent of any right, power, option or agreement in existence during the year of income that related to the management or conduct of the affairs of the company concerned, including any right, power, option or agreement that related to the appointment or removal of directors, the issue, allotment or redemption of shares, the grant, withdrawal or variation of rights in respect of shares, the payment of dividends and the investment or other application of moneys of that company;

       * (d) whether rights of the relevant holding company or holding companies in connexion with the company concerned were exercised during the year of income otherwise than for the benefit of the relevant holding company or holding companies or were not exercised in circumstances where it might reasonably have been expected that they would have been exercised;

       * (e) the nature and source of the income derived by the company concerned during the year of income and whether the derivation by that company of that income was capable of explanation by reference to ordinary commercial dealing;

       * (f) the manner in which the moneys of the company concerned were applied during the year of income and, in particular, whether they were lent to, or invested or otherwise made available for the use or benefit of, a person or persons other than the relevant holding company or holding companies and, if any such moneys were so lent, invested or made available:

        * (i) the terms and conditions upon which the moneys were so lent, invested or made available;

        * (ii) whether the lending, investment or making available of those moneys was capable of explanation by reference to ordinary commercial dealing; and

        * (iii) the connexion (if any) between that person or those persons, the directors of the company concerned and the directors of, or the beneficial owners of the shares in, the company from which the company concerned received dividends before or during the year of income;

       * (g) the respective amounts of any dividends in respect of shares in the company concerned that were paid during the year of income or might reasonably be expected to be paid after that year by that company and the circumstances in which those dividends were, or might be expected to be, paid; and

       * (h) any other relevant matters.

      * (5) Where a company would not, under the preceding provisions of this section, be a public company for the purposes of subsection (1) in relation to the year of income but the Commissioner is of the opinion that, having regard to:

       * (a) the number of persons who were, at any time during the year of income, capable of controlling the company and whether any of those persons was a public company;

       * (b) the market value of the shares issued by the company before the end of the year of income;

       * (c) the number of persons who beneficially owned shares in the company at the end of the year of income; and

       * (d) any other matters that the Commissioner thinks relevant;

      * it is reasonable that the company should be treated as a public company for the purposes of subsection (1) in relation to the year of income, the company shall be deemed to be a public company for those purposes in relation to the year of income.

      * (5A) The Commissioner may, under subsection (5), form an opinion that it is reasonable that a company should be treated as a public company for the purposes of subsection (1) in relation to a year of income notwithstanding that the forming of such an opinion by the Commissioner would impose on the company a liability to pay a greater amount of income tax than the company would otherwise be liable to pay.

      * (6) Notwithstanding anything in the preceding provisions of this section, the Commissioner may treat a company as not being, by virtue of paragraph (2)(a) or (b), a public company for the purposes of subsection (1) in relation to the year of income if the Commissioner is of the opinion that, by reason of:

       * (a) any provisions in the company's constituent document, or in any contract, agreement or instrument, authorizing the variation or abrogation of the voting rights or rights to dividends in respect of any shares in the company or relating to the conversion, exchange or redemption of any such shares;

       * (b) any contract, agreement, option or instrument under which a person has power to acquire shares in the company; or

       * (c) any power or authority in a person in relation to the voting rights or rights to dividends in respect of any shares in the company;

      * the voting rights or rights to dividends in respect of any shares in the company were, at any time during the year of income, capable of being varied or abrogated in such a manner (notwithstanding that they were not in fact varied or abrogated in that manner) that:

       * (d) not less than threequarters of the voting power in the company would have been capable of being exercised by one person or by persons not more than 20 in number;

       * (e) not less than threequarters of:

        * (i) the amount of any dividend paid by the company during the year of income; or

        * (ii) if more than one dividend was paid by the company during the year of income--the total amount of all the dividends paid by the company during the year of income;

       * would have been paid to one person or to persons not more than 20 in number; or

       * (f) in the case where the company did not pay a dividend during the year of income--if a dividend had been paid by the company at any time during the year of income, not less than threequarters of the amount of that dividend would have been paid to one person or to persons not more than 20 in number.

      * (7) For the purposes of this section:

       * (a) a person, whether or not he or she holds shares in the company concerned;

       * (b) his or her relatives; and

       * (c) in relation to any shares in respect of which they are such nominees, his or her nominees and the nominees of any of his or her relatives;

      * shall be deemed to be one person.

##### 109  Excessive payments to shareholders, directors and associates deemed to be dividends

      * (1) If a private company pays or credits to an associated person an amount (in this subsection called the **_excessive amount_**) that is, or purports to be:

       * (a) remuneration for services rendered by the associated person; or

       * (b) an allowance, gratuity or compensation in consequence of the retirement of the associated person from an office or employment held by the associated person in the company, or upon the termination of any such office or employment;

      * so much (if any) of the excessive amount as exceeds an amount that, in the opinion of the Commissioner, is reasonable:

       * (c) is not an allowable deduction; and

       * (d) shall, for the purposes of this Act other than Division 11A of Part III, be deemed to be a dividend paid by the company:

        * (i) to the associated person as a shareholder in the company;

        * (ii) out of profits derived by the company; and

        * (iii) on the last day of the year of income of the company in which the excessive payment or credit is made.

          * Note: This section does not apply to an amount if the amount is paid to a CGT concession stakeholder under subsection 152325(1) of the _Income Tax Assessment Act 1997_ (see subsection 152325(11)).

      * (2) For the purposes of this section:

       * (a) a transfer of property shall be deemed to be the payment of an amount equal to the value of the property; and

       * (b) a reference to an associated person, in relation to a company, is a reference to:

        * (i) a person who is, or has been, a shareholder in, or director of, the company; or

        * (ii) a person who is an associate, within the meaning of section 318, of a person who is, or has been, a shareholder in, or director of, the company.

#### Division 7A--Distributions to entities connected with a private company

##### Subdivision A--Overview of this Division

##### 109B  Simplified outline of this Division

      * The following is a simplified outline of this Division: 

      * This Division treats 3 kinds of amounts as dividends paid by a private company: 

       *  	amounts paid by the company to a shareholder or shareholder's associate (see section 109C);

       *  	amounts lent by the company to a shareholder or shareholder's associate (see sections 109D and 109E);

       *  	amounts of debts owed by a shareholder or shareholder's associate to the company that the company forgives (see section 109F).

      * This treatment makes the amounts assessable income of the shareholder or associate (under section 44).

      * However, some payments, loans and forgiven debts are not treated as dividends. (See Subdivisions C and D.) Also, this Division does not apply to demerger dividends. (See Subdivision DA.)

      * An amount may be treated as a dividend even if it is paid or lent by the company to the shareholder or associate through one or more interposed entities. (See Subdivision E.)

      * An amount may also be included in the assessable income of a shareholder or shareholder's associate if:

          * (a) a company has an unpaid present entitlement to income of a trust; and

          * (b) the trustee makes a payment or loan to, or forgives a debt of, the shareholder or associate.

      * (See Subdivisions EA and EB.)

      * If the total of the amounts is more than the company's distributable surplus, only the part of the total equal to the distributable surplus is treated as dividends. (See section 109Y.)

      * This Division applies to nonshare equity interests and nonshare dividends in the same way it applies to shares and dividends.

##### Subdivision AA--Application of Division

##### 109BA  Application of Division to nonshare dividends

      * This Division: 

       * (a) applies to a nonshare equity interest in the same way as it applies to a share; and

       * (b) applies to an equity holder in the same way as it applies to a shareholder; and

       * (c) applies to a nonshare dividend in the same way as it applies to a dividend.

##### 109BB  Application of Division to closelyheld corporate limited partnerships

      * This Division applies to a corporate limited partnership in relation to a year of income in the same way as it applies to a private company in relation to a year of income, if, any time during the year of income:

       * (a) the partnership has fewer than 50 members; or

       * (b) any entity has, directly or indirectly, and for the entity's own benefit, an entitlement to a 75% or greater share of the income or capital of the partnership.

          * Example: Michael has an entitlement to an 80% share of the income of 2 fixed trusts. The 2 fixed trusts have, between them, an entitlement to 100% of the income of a corporate limited partnership. For the purposes of paragraph (b), Michael has, indirectly, and for his own benefit, an entitlement to a 75% or greater share of the income of the partnership.

##### 109BC  Application of Division to nonresident companies

      * (1) This Division applies, in relation to a payment, loan or debt forgiveness, in relation to a private company that is a nonresident as if:

       * (a) references in this Division to a year of income of the company were references to a tax accounting period in relation to the company in relation to a foreign tax imposed by a tax law of:

        * (i) if the company is a resident of only one foreign country--that foreign country; or

        * (ii) otherwise--the foreign country to which subsection (2) applies; and

       * (b) references in this Division to the lodgment day for the year of income were references to the due date for lodgment of the company's return of income for the tax accounting period under that tax law.

      * (2) For the purposes of subparagraph (1)(a)(ii), this subsection applies to a foreign country (the **_relevant country_**) if:

       * (a) the company is a resident of the relevant country; and

       * (b) of all the tax accounting periods:

        * (i) in relation to the company in relation to the foreign taxes imposed by the tax laws of the foreign countries of which the company is resident; and

        * (ii) during which the payment, loan or debt forgiveness is made;

       * the tax accounting period under the tax law of the relevant country ends first; and

       * (c) if more than one of the tax accounting periods mentioned in paragraph (b) end first--the due date for lodgment of the company's return of income for the tax accounting period under the tax law of the relevant country is not later than the due date for lodgment for any of the other tax accounting periods that end first.

      * (3) In this section:

      * **_tax accounting period_** has the meaning given by section 317.

      * **_tax law_** has the meaning given by section 317.

          * Note: Section 109L prevents amounts from being included in assessable income under this Division if the amounts are included in, or excluded from, assessable income under another provision of this Act, such as the rules relating to CFCs and FIFs.

##### Subdivision B--Private company payments, loans and debt forgiveness are treated as dividends

##### 109C  Payments treated as dividends

      * When private company is taken to pay a dividend

      * (1) A private company is taken to pay a dividend to an entity at the end of the private company's year of income if the private company pays an amount to the entity during the year and either:

       * (a) the payment is made when the entity is a shareholder in the private company or an associate of such a shareholder; or

       * (b) a reasonable person would conclude (having regard to all the circumstances) that the payment is made because the entity has been such a shareholder or associate at some time.

          * Note 1: Some payments do not give rise to dividends under Subdivision D. This section also does not give rise to a dividend if the amount is paid to a CGT concession stakeholder under subsection 152325(1) of the _Income Tax Assessment Act 1997_ (see subsection 152325(11)).

          * Note 2: A private company is treated as making a payment to a shareholder or shareholder's associate if an interposed entity makes a payment to the shareholder or associate. See Subdivision E.

      * Amount of dividend

      * (2) The dividend is taken to equal the amount paid, subject to section 109Y.

          * Note: Section 109Y limits the total amount of dividends taken to have been paid by a private company under this Division to the company's distributable surplus.

      * What is a payment to an entity?

      * (3) In this Division, **_payment_** to an entity means:

       * (a) a payment to the extent that it is to the entity, on behalf of the entity or for the benefit of the entity; and

       * (b) a credit of an amount to the extent that it is:

        * (i) to the entity; or

        * (ii) on behalf of the entity; or

        * (iii) for the benefit of the entity; and

       * (c) a transfer of property to the entity.

          * Note: See also section 109CA (**_Payment_** includes provision of asset).

      * Loans are not payments

      * (3A) However, a loan to an entity is not a payment to the entity.

          * Note: Payments converted to loans before the private company's lodgment day are treated as loans (see subsection 109D(4A)).

      * Value of payment by transfer of property

      * (4) The amount of a payment consisting of a transfer of property is the amount that would have been paid for the transfer by parties dealing at arm's length less any consideration given by the transferee for the transfer. (The amount of a payment is nil if the consideration given by the transferee equals or exceeds the amount that would have been paid at arm's length for the transfer.)

##### 109CA  Payment includes provision of asset

      * (1) In this Division, **_payment_** to an entity includes the provision of an asset for use by the entity.

          * Note: This includes provision under a lease or licence.

          * Example: Yacht builder Mainbrace Enterprises Pty Ltd owns a yacht for the purpose of sales demonstrations. With the private company's permission, one of its shareholders uses the yacht on weekends. The company has made a **_payment_** to the shareholder, unless one of the exceptions to subsection (1) applies.

      * (2) The time the payment is made is the time the entity first:

       * (a) uses the asset with the permission of the provider of the asset; or

       * (b) has a right to use the asset (whether alone or together with other entities), at a time when the provider of the asset does not have a right:

        * (i) to use the asset; or

        * (ii) to provide the asset for use by another entity.

          * Example: Paragraph (a) could apply if a shareholder were driving a company car with the company's permission. Paragraph (b) could apply if the shareholder had the car parked at his or her house or at another place of his or her choosing.

      * (3) However, if the use or right continues into another income year of the entity, treat the provision of the asset for use in the other income year as being a separate payment made at the start of that year.

      * Exceptions

      * (4) Subsection (1) does not apply if the provision of the asset would, if done in respect of the employment of an employee, be a minor benefit under section 58P of the _Fringe Benefits Tax Assessment Act 1986_.

      * (5) Subsection (1) does not apply to the extent that, if the entity had incurred and paid expenditure in respect of the provision of the asset, a onceonly deduction would have been allowable to the entity in respect of the expenditure, ignoring:

       * (a) section 82A (Deductions for expenses of selfeducation); and

       * (b) Divisions 28 (Car expenses) and 900 (Substantiation rules) of the _Income Tax Assessment Act 1997_.

      * (6) Subsection (1) does not apply to the provision of a dwelling, if:

       * (a) the entity, or an associate of the entity, carries on a business; and

       * (b) the entity or associate:

        * (i) uses; or

        * (ii) is granted or has a lease, licence or other right to use;

       * land, water or a building for the purpose of carrying on the business; and

       * (c) the provision of the dwelling to the entity is connected with that use or with that lease, licence or other right.

          * Note: For the meaning of **_land_**, see section 2B of the _Acts Interpretation Act 1901_.

      * (7) Subsection (1) does not apply to the provision of a dwelling, if:

       * (a) the dwelling is the main residence of the entity; and

       * (b) the provider of the dwelling is a private company; and

       * (c) the private company acquired the dwelling before 1 July 2009; and

       * (d) the private company would meet the conditions in section 16512 of the _Income Tax Assessment Act 1997_ (which is about the company maintaining the same owners) if, despite subsection 16512(1), the **_ownership test period_** were the period:

        * (i) starting on the start of 1 July 2009; and

        * (ii) ending at the time of payment, worked out under subsection (2) of this section.

      * (7A) Subsection (1) does not apply to the provision of a dwelling to the entity if:

       * (a) the dwelling is a flat or home unit that is part of a complex of 2 or more flats or home units; and

       * (b) the provider of the dwelling is a company that owns a legal or equitable interest in the land on which the complex is erected; and

       * (c) there is more than one share in the company, and each share (whether singly or as part of a parcel of shares) gives the relevant shareholder the right to occupy a flat or home unit in the complex; and

       * (d) each flat or home unit in the complex is covered by a share, or a parcel of shares, in the company; and

       * (e) the dwelling is provided to the entity because a shareholder holds such a share, or parcel of shares; and

       * (f) the company does not have legal or equitable interests in any assets other than legal or equitable interests in:

        * (i) the complex, and the land on which it is erected; and

        * (ii) any related land and buildings; and

        * (iii) any related plant, machinery, equipment, furniture or fittings; and

        * (iv) any assets relating to the matters mentioned in paragraph (g); and

       * (g) the assessable income of the company is derived predominantly from:

        * (i) managing and maintaining the complex (including the assets mentioned in subparagraphs (f)(i), (ii) and (iii)); and

        * (ii) interest and dividends relating to income derived from managing and maintaining the complex (including the assets mentioned in those subparagraphs).

      * (7B) Subsection (7A) does not apply in a case to which Subdivision E (about interposed entities) applies, if the company mentioned in that subsection is interposed between:

       * (a) a private company; and

       * (b) a shareholder, or an associate of a shareholder, of the private company.

      * (8) Section 118120 of the _Income Tax Assessment Act 1997_ (Extension to adjacent land) applies in relation to subsections (6) to (7A) of this section in the same way as it applies in relation to Subdivision 118B of that Act.

      * (9) Subsection (1) does not apply if the provision of the asset to the entity is a transfer of property to the entity.

          * Note: For transfers of property, see paragraph 109C(3)(c).

      * Value of payment

      * (10) Subject to subsection (11), the amount of the payment is:

       * (a) the amount that would have been paid for the provision of the asset by the parties dealing at arm's length; less

       * (b) any consideration given for the provision of the asset by the entity.

      * (11) The amount of the payment is nil if the consideration given by the entity equals or exceeds the amount that would have been paid at arm's length for the provision of the asset.

##### 109D  Loans treated as dividends

      * Loans treated as dividends in year of making

      * (1) A private company is taken to pay a dividend to an entity at the end of one of the private company's years of income (the **_current year_**) if:

       * (a) the private company makes a loan to the entity during the current year; and

       * (b) the loan is not fully repaid before the lodgment day for the current year; and

       * (c) Subdivision D does not prevent the private company from being taken to pay a dividend because of the loan at the end of the current year; and

       * (d) either:

        * (i) the entity is a shareholder in the private company, or an associate of such a shareholder, when the loan is made; or

        * (ii) a reasonable person would conclude (having regard to all the circumstances) that the loan is made because the entity has been such a shareholder or associate at some time.

          * Note 1: Some repayments cannot be counted for the purpose of this subsection. See section 109R.

          * Note 2: A private company is treated as making a loan to a shareholder or shareholder's associate if an interposed entity makes a loan to the shareholder or associate. See Subdivision E.

      * Amount of dividend

      * (1AA) The amount of the dividend taken under subsection (1) to have been paid is the amount of the loan that has not been repaid before the lodgment day for the current year, subject to section 109Y.

          * Note: Section 109Y limits the total amount of dividends taken to have been paid by a private company under this Division to the company's distributable surplus.

      * Loans treated as dividends in year following that of making

      * (1A) A private company is taken to pay a dividend to an entity at the end of the private company's year of income (the **_current year_**) if:

        * (i) the entity is a shareholder in the private company, or an associate of such a shareholder, when the loan is made; or

        * (ii) a reasonable person would conclude (having regard to all the circumstances) that the loan is made because the entity has been such a shareholder or associate at some time.

      * Subdivision D (other than section 109R) does not apply to loans covered by this subsection.

      * Amount of dividend

      * (2) The amount of the dividend taken under subsection (1A) to have been paid is the amount of the loan that has not been repaid at the end of the current year, subject to section 109Y.

          * Note: Section 109Y limits the total amount of dividends taken to have been paid by a private company under this Division to the company's distributable surplus.

      * What is a loan?

      * (3) In this Division, **_loan_** includes:

       * (a) an advance of money; and

       * (b) a provision of credit or any other form of financial accommodation; and

       * (c) a payment of an amount for, on account of, on behalf of or at the request of, an entity, if there is an express or implied obligation to repay the amount; and

       * (d) a transaction (whatever its terms or form) which in substance effects a loan of money.

      * In which year of income is a loan made?

      * (4) For the purposes of this Division, a loan is made to an entity at the time the amount of the loan is paid to the entity by way of loan or anything described in subsection (3) is done in relation to the entity.

      * Payment converted to loan before lodgment day

      * (4A) If:

       * (a) a private company makes a payment to an entity at a time in a year of income; and

       * (b) the payment is converted to a loan before the end of the private company's lodgment day for the year of income;

      * for the purposes of this Division, treat the events mentioned in paragraphs (a) and (b) as the private company making a loan to the entity at the time mentioned in paragraph (a).

      * Loans made before 4 December 1997

      * (5) If the terms of a loan made before 4 December 1997 are varied on or after that day by extending the term of the loan or increasing its amount, this Division applies to the loan as if it were made on the new terms when the variation occurred.

      * When is the lodgment day?

      * (6) In this Division, the **_lodgment day_** for a private company's year of income is the earlier of:

       * (a) the due date for lodgment of the private company's return of income for the year of income; and

       * (b) the date of lodgment of the private company's return of income for the year of income.

          * Note: For the lodgment day for a private company that is a nonresident, see section 109BC.

##### 109E  Amalgamated loan from a previous year treated as dividend if minimum repayment not made

      * Amalgamated loan treated as dividend in first year in which payment is less than minimum yearly repayment

      * (1) A private company is taken to pay a dividend to an entity at the end of one of the private company's years of income (the **_current year_**) if:

       * (a) the private company made an amalgamated loan to the entity in an earlier year of income; and

       * (b) the amalgamated loan is not repaid at the end of the current year; and

       * (c) the amount (if any) paid to the private company during the current year in relation to the amalgamated loan falls short of the minimum yearly repayment of the amalgamated loan worked out under subsection (5) for the current year; and

       * (d) section 109Q does not apply in relation to the current year.

          * Note: The amalgamated loan does not give rise to a dividend for that year if the minimum yearly repayment is not made and the entity satisfies the Commissioner that treating the loan as a dividend would cause hardship. See section 109Q.

      * Amount of dividend

      * (2) The amount of the dividend is taken to be the amount of the shortfall mentioned in paragraph (1)(c), subject to section 109Y.

          * Note: Section 109Y limits the total amount of dividends taken to have been paid by a private company under this Division to the company's distributable surplus.

      * What is an amalgamated loan?

      * (3) For the purposes of this Division, a private company is taken to make a loan (the **_amalgamated loan_**) to a single entity during a year of income if the private company makes one or more loans (**_constituent loans_**) to the entity during the year, each of which:

       * (a) is not fully repaid before the lodgment day for the year; and

       * (b) would cause the company to be taken under section 109D to pay a dividend to the entity at the end of the year, apart from section 109N; and

       * (c) has the same maximum term for the purposes of that section.

      * The amount of the amalgamated loan is the sum of the amounts of the constituent loans that have not been repaid before the lodgment day for the year of income in which the amalgamated loan is made.

      * (3A) Subsection (3B) applies if:

       * (a) a private company is taken to have made an amalgamated loan (the **_old amalgamated loan_**) during a year of income (the **_original year of income_**); and

       * (b) the maximum term of the old amalgamated loan under subsection 109N(3) was 7 years; and

       * (c) in a later year of income (the **_later year of income_**):

        * (i) a constituent loan taken account of by the old amalgamated loan becomes secured by a mortgage over real property; and

        * (ii) the term of the constituent loan is extended; and

       * (d) as a result of the mortgage, the maximum term of the constituent loan under subsection 109N(3) is 25 years; and

       * (e) the term of the constituent loan after the extension (including the period before the extension during which the constituent loan was in existence) does not exceed 25 years.

      * (3B) For the purposes of this Division in relation to the later year of income and subsequent years of income:

       * (a) treat the constituent loan as a new amalgamated loan that takes account of that constituent loan; and

       * (b) treat the new amalgamated loan as having been made just before the start of the later year of income; and

       * (c) treat the amount of the new amalgamated loan just before the start of the later year of income as the amount of the constituent loan that had not been repaid at that time; and

       * (d) unless paragraph (e) applies--reduce the amount of the old amalgamated loan just before the start of the later year of income by the amount of the new amalgamated loan at that time; and

       * (e) if the constituent loan was the only constituent loan taken account of by the old amalgamated loan--disregard the old amalgamated loan.

      * Payments in relation to constituent loans treated as payments in relation to amalgamated loan

      * (4) For the purposes of this Division, a payment to the private company in relation to a constituent loan in a year of income after the one in which the constituent loan was made is taken to be a payment in relation to the amalgamated loan that takes account of the constituent loan.

      * Minimum yearly repayment

      * (5) The minimum yearly repayment of an amalgamated loan for a year of income is the amount worked out using the formula in subsection (6). However, the minimum yearly repayment of an amalgamated loan for a year of income is the amount worked out under the regulations, if they provide for working it out.

      * Formula for minimum yearly repayment

      * (6) The formula for the minimum yearly repayment for a year of income is:

      * where: 

      * **_current year's benchmark interest rate_** is the benchmark interest rate for the year of income for which the minimum yearly repayment is being worked out.

      * **_remaining term_** is the difference between:

       * (a) the number of years in the longest term of any of the constituent loans that the amalgamated loan takes account of; and

       * (b) the number of years between the end of the private company's year of income in which the loan was made and the end of the private company's year of income before the year of income for which the minimum yearly repayment is being worked out;

      * rounded up to the next higher whole number if the difference is not already a whole number.

          * Note: Section 109R provides that certain payments relating to a loan are not to be taken into account for the purposes of working out the minimum yearly repayment.

      * Benchmark interest rate used to work out how much of a payment relating to amalgamated loan is a repayment

      * (7) Work out the amount of an amalgamated loan repaid by the end of a year of income on the basis that interest is payable on the balance of the loan from time to time in a year of income at a rate equal to the benchmark interest rate for the year of income.

##### 109F  Forgiven debts treated as dividends

      * Forgiven debt treated as dividend

      * (1) A private company is taken to pay a dividend to an entity at the end of the private company's year of income if all or part of a debt the entity owed the private company is forgiven in that year and either:

       * (a) the amount is forgiven when the entity is a shareholder in the private company, or an associate of such a shareholder; or

       * (b) a reasonable person would conclude (having regard to all the circumstances) that the amount is forgiven because the entity has been such a shareholder or associate at some time.

          * Note: In some cases forgiving a debt does not give rise to a dividend. See section 109G.

      * Amount of dividend

      * (2) The amount of the dividend equals the amount of debt forgiven, subject to section 109Y.

          * Note: Section 109Y limits the total amount of dividends taken to have been paid by a private company under this Division to the company's distributable surplus.

      * When is a debt forgiven?

      * (3) An amount of a debt is **_forgiven_** for the purposes of this Division if and when the amount would be forgiven under section 24535 or 24537 of the _Income Tax Assessment Act 1997_, assuming the amount were a debt to which Subdivisions 245C to 245G of that Act apply.

          * Note: Division 245 of the _Income Tax Assessment Act 1997_ applies to forgiveness of certain commercial debts.

      * Discharge of debt by transfer of property is not forgiveness

      * (4) Despite subsection (3), an amount of debt is not forgiven for the purposes of this Division if the obligation to pay the amount is discharged by a payment to the creditor consisting of a transfer of property.

          * Note: Subsection 109C(4) explains how to work out the value of a payment consisting of a transfer of property.

      * Debt forgiveness by debt parking

      * (5) An amount of debt an entity (the **_debtor_**) owes a private company is also **_forgiven_** for the purposes of this Division if:

       * (a) the private company assigns the right to receive payment of the amount to another entity (the **_new creditor_**) who is either:

        * (i) an associate of the debtor; or

        * (ii) a party to an arrangement with the debtor about the assignment; and

       * (b) a reasonable person would conclude (having regard to all the circumstances) that the new creditor will not exercise the assigned right.

      * Debt forgiveness by failure to rely on obligation to pay

      * (6) An amount of debt an entity (the **_debtor_**) owes a private company is also **_forgiven_** for the purposes of this Division if a reasonable person would conclude (having regard to all the circumstances) that the private company will not insist on the entity paying the amount or rely on the entity's obligation to pay the amount. (The amount is forgiven when a reasonable person would first reach that conclusion.)

      * Forgiveness of amalgamated loan debt

      * (7) If a private company forgives an amount of debt resulting from a constituent loan taken into account in working out the amount of an amalgamated loan under subsection 109E(3), the private company is taken to forgive the same amount of the debt resulting from the amalgamated loan.

      * This section operates on only the earliest debt forgiveness

      * (8) If the same debt is forgiven for the purposes of this Division at different times under different provisions of this section, this section operates on the first forgiveness only.

          * Example: Subsection (3) of this section provides that a debt is forgiven if it has not been paid by the time a statute of limitations prevents recovery of the debt. (It does this by applying paragraph 24535(b) of the _Income Tax Assessment Act 1997_.) The debt might already have been forgiven under subsection (6) of this section (because a reasonable person would have concluded earlier that the private company was not going to insist on payment). This section would apply to the forgiveness under subsection (6) but not the forgiveness under subsection (3).

##### Subdivision C--Forgiven debts that are not treated as dividends

##### 109G  Debt forgiveness that does not give rise to a dividend

      * Forgiveness of debt owed by company generally not treated as dividend

      * (1) A private company is not taken under this Division to pay a dividend because a debt owed to it by another company is forgiven.

          * Note: This does not apply to a debt owed by a company as trustee. (See section 109ZE.)

      * Forgiveness of debts under Bankruptcy Act not treated as dividends

      * (2) A private company is not taken under this Division to pay a dividend because a debt is forgiven because the debtor becomes a bankrupt or because of Part X of the _Bankruptcy Act 1966_.

      * Forgiveness of loan debt does not give rise to dividend if loan gives rise to dividend under section 109D

      * (3) A private company is not taken under section 109F to pay a dividend at the end of a year of income because of the forgiveness of an amount of a debt resulting from a loan if, because of the loan, the private company is taken:

       * (a) under section 109D to pay a dividend at the end of that year or an earlier one; or

       * (b) under former subsection 108(1) to pay a dividend on the last day of that year or an earlier one.

      * Reduced dividend for forgiveness of loan debt if loan causes dividend under section 109E

      * (3A) Subsection (3B) applies if:

       * (a) a private company is taken under section 109F to pay a dividend at the end of a year of income because of the forgiveness of an amount of a debt resulting from a loan; and

       * (b) the private company is taken under section 109E to pay a dividend at the end of an earlier year of income in relation to the loan.

      * (3B) The amount of the dividend mentioned in paragraph (3A)(a) is reduced by the amount of the dividend mentioned in paragraph (3A)(b) (but not below zero).

          * Note: There may be more than one reduction under this subsection if the private company has been taken under section 109E to pay more than one dividend in relation to the loan.

      * Commissioner may treat forgiveness as not giving rise to dividend

      * (4) A private company is not taken under this Division to pay a dividend because of the forgiveness of a debt owed by an entity if the Commissioner is satisfied that:

       * (a) the debt was forgiven because payment of the debt would have caused the entity undue hardship; and

       * (b) when the entity incurred the debt, the entity had the capacity to pay the debt; and

       * (c) the entity lost the ability to pay the debt in the foreseeable future as a result of circumstances beyond the entity's control.

##### Subdivision D--Payments and loans that are not treated as dividends

      * An amalgamated loan may not be treated as a dividend if the Commissioner is satisfied that doing so would cause undue hardship. (See section 109Q.)

      * This Subdivision also provides for some loan repayments and interest payments to private companies to be disregarded if they are made with the intention of borrowing a similar amount from a private company later. (See section 109R.)

##### 109J  Payments discharging pecuniary obligations not treated as dividends

      * A private company is not taken under section 109C to pay a dividend because of the payment of an amount, to the extent that the payment:

       * (a) discharges an obligation of the private company to pay money to the entity; and

       * (b) is not more than would have been required to discharge the obligation had the private company and entity been dealing with each other at arm's length.

##### 109K  Intercompany payments and loans not treated as dividends

      * A private company is not taken under section 109C or 109D to pay a dividend because of a payment or loan the private company makes to another company.

          * Note: This does not apply to a payment or loan to a company in its capacity as trustee. (See section 109ZE.)

##### 109L  Certain payments and loans not treated as dividends

      * (1) A private company is not taken under section 109C or 109D to pay a dividend because of a payment or loan the private company makes to an entity, to the extent that the payment or loan would be included in the entity's assessable income apart from this Division (as it operates in conjunction with section 44).

      * (2) In addition, a private company is not taken under section 109C or 109D to pay a dividend because of a payment or loan that the private company made to an entity to the extent that a provision of this Act (other than this Division) has the effect that the payment or loan is not included in the entity's assessable income even though it would otherwise be included.

##### 109M  Loans made in the ordinary course of business on arm's length terms not treated as dividends

      * A private company is not taken under section 109D to pay a dividend because of a loan made:

      * Criteria

      * (1) A private company that makes a loan to an entity in one of the private company's years of income is not taken under section 109D to pay a dividend at the end of the year of income because of the loan if, before the lodgment day for the year of income:

       * (a) the agreement that the loan was made under is in writing; and

       * (b) the rate of interest payable on the loan for years of income after the year in which the loan is made equals or exceeds the benchmark interest rate for the year; and

       * (c) the term of the loan does not exceed the term (the **_maximum term_**) for that kind of loan worked out under subsection (3).

      * Benchmark interest rate

      * (2) The **_benchmark interest rate_** for the year of income is the Indicator Lending Rates--Bank variable housing loans interest rate last published by the Reserve Bank of  before the start of the year of income. However, the benchmark interest rate is the rate worked out under the regulations, if they provide for working it out.

      * Maximum term

      * (3) The maximum term is:

       * (a) 25 years for a loan if:

      * (3B) The amount of the reduction is equal to the length of the period:

       * (a) starting when the old loan was made; and

       * (b) ending when the old loan was refinanced.

      * (3C) Reduce the maximum term under paragraph (3)(b) for a loan (the **_new loan_**) in accordance with subsection (3D) if:

      * Regulations may adopt rate as published from time to time

      * (4) Regulations made for the purposes of subsection (2) may apply, adopt or incorporate a rate published in an instrument after they are made or take effect, or a rate contained in an instrument from time to time despite any other Act.

##### 109NA  Certain liquidator's distributions and loans not treated as dividends

      * A private company is not taken under section 109C or subsection 109D(1) to pay a dividend because of a distribution or loan made in the course of the windingup of the company by a liquidator.

          * Note: However, if such a loan is not fully repaid by the end of the following year of income, the company will be taken to have paid a dividend under subsection 109D(1A).

##### 109NB  Loans to purchase shares under employee share schemes not treated as dividends

      * A private company is not taken under section 109D to pay a dividend because of a loan made solely for the purpose of enabling the shareholder, or an associate of the shareholder, to acquire an ESS interest under an employee share scheme (within the meaning of the _Income Tax Assessment Act 1997_) to which:

       * (a) Subdivision 83AB and subsections 83A35(3) to (9) of that Act apply; or

      * A private company is not taken under section 109D to pay a dividend because of an amalgamated loan it makes.

          * Note: A shortfall in a minimum yearly repayment of an amalgamated loan may be treated as a dividend under section 109E.

##### 109Q  Commissioner may allow amalgamated loan not to be treated as dividend

      * (1) A private company is not taken under section 109E to pay a dividend at the end of one of its years of income (the **_current year_**) because of an amalgamated loan to an entity if:

       * (a) the amount paid to the private company by the entity in the current year in relation to the loan is less than the minimum yearly repayment of the loan for the current year worked out under subsection 109E(5); and

       * (b) the entity satisfies the Commissioner that:

        * (i) that amount was less than the minimum yearly repayment because of circumstances beyond the entity's control; and

        * (ii) the entity would suffer undue hardship if the private company were taken under section 109E to pay a dividend to the entity at the end of the current year because of the loan.

      * (2) In deciding whether he or she is satisfied, the Commissioner must consider:

       * (a) the entity's capacity, at the end of the year of income in which the amalgamated loan was made, to repay the loan; and

       * (b) any circumstances that have reduced the entity's capacity to repay the loan; and

       * (c) whether the entity took all reasonable steps to make payments relating to the amalgamated loan during the current year equal to the minimum yearly repayment of the loan for the current year; and

       * (d) whether the entity has made payments relating to the loan as soon as possible after the current year equalling the difference between:

        * (i) the minimum yearly repayment for the current year; and

        * (ii) the amount of payments made during the current year relating to the loan.

##### 109R  Some payments relating to loans not taken into account

      * (1) This section provides for some payments to a private company in relation to a loan the private company made to an entity not to be taken into account for the purpose of working out:

       * (a) how much of the loan has been repaid for the purposes of sections 109D and 109E (which treat amounts of loans that have not been repaid as dividends); or

       * (b) the minimum yearly repayment for the loan under subsection 109E(5).

      * (2) A payment must not be taken into account if:

       * (a) a reasonable person would conclude (having regard to all the circumstances) that, when the payment was made, the entity intended to obtain a loan or loans from the private company of a total amount similar to, or larger than, the payment; or

       * (b) both of the following subparagraphs apply:

        * (i) the entity obtained, before the payment was made, a loan or loans from the private company of a total amount similar to, or larger than, the amount of the payment;

        * (ii) a reasonable person would conclude (having regard to all the circumstances) that the entity obtained the loan or loans in order to make the payment.

      * (3) Subsection (2) does not apply to a payment made by setting off against an amount payable in relation to the loan:

       * (a) a dividend payable by the private company to the entity; or

       * (b) work and income support related withholding payments and benefits payable by the private company to the entity; or

       * (ba) payments covered by section 1255 in Schedule 1 to the _Taxation Administration Act 1953_; or

       * (c) if the entity has transferred property to the private company--an amount equalling the difference between:

        * (i) the amount that a party at arm's length from the entity would have paid for the transfer of the property to the party; and

        * (ii) the amount that the private company has already paid the entity (by way of setoff or otherwise) for the transfer.

      * (4) Nor does subsection (2) apply to a payment made on behalf of the entity (the **_borrower_**) by another entity paying to the private company an amount that:

       * (a) is payable by the other entity to the borrower; and

       * (b) is assessable income of the borrower for the year of income in which the payment was made or an earlier year of income.

      * (5) Subsection (2) does not apply to a payment if:

       * (a) the payment is made to refinance the loan mentioned in subsection (1) (the **_old loan_**); and

       * (b) the entity to which the old loan was made has another loan (the **_primary_** loan) from another entity; and

       * (g) the private company and the other entity dealt with each other at arm's length in relation to that subordination.

      * (6) Subsection (2) does not apply to a payment if:

##### Subdivision E--Payments and loans through interposed entities

##### 109S  Simplified outline of this Subdivision

      * The following is a simplified outline of this Subdivision: 

      * This Subdivision allows a private company to be taken under Subdivision B to pay a dividend to an entity (the **_target entity_**) if an entity interposed between the private company and the target entity makes a payment or loan to the target entity under an arrangement involving the private company.

      * This result is achieved by treating the private company as making a payment or loan of an amount determined by the Commissioner to the target entity (according to whether the interposed entity made a payment or loan to the target entity). (See sections 109V (for payments) and 109W (for loans).)

      * The arrangement must involve the private company and one or more interposed entities in making payments or loans or giving loan guarantees for the purpose of the target entity receiving a payment or loan from an interposed entity. (See sections 109T, 109U and 109UA.)

      * If the target entity repays a fraction of the loan made by the interposed entity, the target entity is treated as repaying the same fraction of the loan taken to have been made by the private company. (See subsection 109W(3).)

      * Some provisions that prevent payments or loans from giving rise to dividends do not apply to payments or loans this Subdivision treats a private company as making. (See section 109X.)

##### 109T  Payments and loans by a private company to an entity through one or more interposed entities

      * (1) This Division operates as if a private company makes a payment or loan to an entity (the **_target entity_**) as described in section 109V or 109W if:

       * (a) the private company makes a payment or loan to another entity (the **_first interposed entity_**) that is interposed between the private company and the target entity; and

       * (b) a reasonable person would conclude (having regard to all the circumstances) that the private company made the payment or loan solely or mainly as part of an arrangement involving a payment or loan to the target entity; and

       * (c) either:

        * (i) the first interposed entity makes a payment or loan to the target entity; or

        * (ii) another entity interposed between the private company and the target entity makes a payment or loan to the target entity.

      * This section operates regardless of certain factors

      * (2) For the purposes of this section, it does not matter:

       * (a) whether the interposed entity made the payment or loan to the target entity before, after or at the same time as the first interposed entity received the payment or loan from the private company; or

       * (b) whether or not the interposed entity paid or lent the target entity the same amount as the private company paid or lent the first interposed entity.

      * This section does not operate if the payment or loan to the first interposed entity is treated as a dividend

      * (3) This Division does not operate as described in subsection (1) (and sections 109V and 109W) if the private company is taken under Subdivision B (as it applies apart from this Subdivision) to pay a dividend as a result of the payment or loan to the first interposed entity.

##### 109U  Payments and loans through interposed entities relying on guarantees

      * (1) This Division operates as if a private company makes a payment to an entity (the **_target entity_**) as described in section 109V if:

       * (a) during a year of income the private company guarantees a loan made by another entity (the **_first interposed entity_**); and

       * (b) a reasonable person would conclude (having regard to all the circumstances) that the private company gave the guarantee solely or mainly as part of an arrangement involving a payment or loan to the target entity; and

       * (c) either:

        * (i) the first interposed entity that is a private company makes a loan to the target entity; or

        * (ii) another entity that is a private company interposed between the private company and the target entity makes a payment or loan to the target entity; and

       * (d) the amount of the payment or the loan is greater than the amount worked out using the formula:

      * (2) The amount of the payment from the private company to the target entity (as worked out under section 109V) is to be reduced by the amount worked out using the formula:

      * (3) In the formulas in paragraph (1)(d) and subsection (2):

      * **_distributable surplus_** means the distributable surplus (worked out under subsection 109Y(2)) for the interposed entity that made the payment or loan to the target entity for the year of income.

      * **_subsection 109Y(3) amount_** means the total of any amounts calculated under subsection 109Y(3) in relation to that interposed entity for the year of income (apart from as a result of the operation of this section).

      * This section operates regardless of certain factors

      * (4) For the purposes of this section, it does not matter:

       * (a) whether the interposed entity made the payment or loan to the target entity before, after or at the same time as the first interposed entity received the guarantee from the private company; or

       * (b) whether or not the interposed entity paid or lent the target entity the same amount as the private company guaranteed.

##### 109UA  Certain liabilities under guarantees treated as payments

      * (1) Section 109T operates as if one entity (the **_first entity_**) makes a payment to a second entity if the first entity guarantees a loan the second entity makes to a third entity (the **_target entity_**) and, as a result of the guarantee, the first entity has a liability (other than a contingent liability) to make a payment to the second entity.

          * Example: A private company guarantees a loan that a bank makes to a shareholder in the private company and the shareholder defaults on the loan. As a result, the company has a presently existing liability to make a payment to the bank. Section 109T operates as if the private company had made a payment to the bank, so the company is treated by section 109V as making a payment to the shareholder (because the bank is interposed between company and shareholder).

      * (2) The amount of the payment (as worked out under section 109V) is to be reduced by any amount treated as a dividend as a result of the operation of section 109U in relation to the payment or loan made by the interposed entity to the target entity.

      * (3) A private company is not taken under this Division to pay a dividend because of the operation of subsection (1) in relation to a guarantee if the Commissioner is satisfied that:

       * (a) the target entity would suffer undue hardship if the private company were taken to pay a dividend to the entity because of the liability; and

       * (b) when the target entity entered into the loan, the entity had the capacity to pay the loan.

      * (4) This section does not the limit the operation of section 109T.

      * (5) Subsection (1) does not apply if:

       * (a) as a result of the first entity's liability mentioned in that subsection, the target entity has a liability (other than a contingent liability) to make a payment to the first entity; and

       * (b) because of section 109N, the liability to make a payment to the first entity is not treated under this Division as giving rise to a dividend paid to the first entity.

##### 109V  Amount of private company's payment to target entity through one or more interposed entities

      * Private company taken to pay if target entity is paid

      * (1) If the target entity is paid an amount by the interposed entity, this Division operates as if the private company had paid the amount (if any) determined by the Commissioner to the target entity when the interposed entity paid the target entity.

      * Determining the amount of the private company's payment

      * (2) In determining the amount of the payment the private company is taken to have made, the Commissioner must take account of:

       * (a) the amount the interposed entity paid the target entity; and

       * (b) how much (if any) of that amount the Commissioner believes represented consideration payable to the target entity by the private company or any of the interposed entities for anything (assuming that the consideration payable equals that for similar transactions at arm's length).

##### 109W  Private company's loan to target entity through one or more interposed entities

      * Private company taken to lend if target entity receives loan

      * (1) If the target entity is lent an amount by the interposed entity, this Division operates as if the private company had made a loan (the **_notional loan_**) of the amount (if any) determined by the Commissioner to the target entity when the interposed entity made the loan to the target entity.

          * Note: Subsection 109D(4) specifies the time at which a loan is made.

      * How big is the notional loan?

      * (2) In determining the amount of the notional loan, the Commissioner must take account of:

       * (a) the amount the interposed entity lent the target entity; and

       * (b) how much (if any) of that amount the Commissioner believes represented consideration payable to the target entity by the private company or any of the interposed entities for anything (assuming that the consideration payable equals that for similar transactions at arm's length).

      * Notional repayments of notional loan

      * (3) When working out whether the private company is taken under section 109D to pay a dividend as a result of the notional loan, and the amount of any such dividend, assume that the target entity repays an amount of the notional loan equal to the amount worked out using the formula:

      * where: 

      * **_amount actually lent to target entity_** is the amount the interposed entity lent to the target entity.

      * **_repayment made by target entity to lender_** is the amount of any repayment made by the target entity of the loan the interposed entity made to the target entity.

##### 109X  Operation of Subdivision D in relation to payment or loan

      * Payment or loan not affected by being made through interposed entity

      * (1) Despite sections 109K and 109L, a private company may be taken under section 109C or 109D to pay a dividend as a result of this Subdivision treating the private company as making a payment or loan to an entity (the **_target entity_**), even if:

       * (a) the private company is treated that way because it makes a payment or loan to an entity that is a company interposed between the private company and the target entity; or

       * (b) some or all of the amount paid or lent by a private company to an entity interposed between the private company and the target entity is included in the interposed entity's assessable income for a year of income.

      * (2) Subsections (3) and (4) apply if a notional loan arises under section 109W because an entity interposed between the private company and the target entity makes a loan (the **_actual loan_**) to the target entity.

      * (3) For the purposes of section 109N, treat the agreement under which the actual loan was made as the agreement under which the notional loan was made.

      * (4) For the purposes of section 109E:

       * (a) treat the notional loan as an amalgamated loan from the private company to the target entity; and

       * (b) treat the amount of the notional loan worked out under subsection 109W(1) as the amount of the amalgamated loan; and

       * (c) treat the agreement under which the actual loan was made as the agreement under which the amalgamated loan was made; and

       * (d) treat repayments by the target entity of the amount of the notional loan worked out under subsection 109W(3) as payments by the target entity to the private company in relation to the amalgamated loan.

##### Subdivision EA--Unpaid present entitlements

##### 109XA  Payments, loans and debt forgiveness by a trustee in favour of a shareholder etc. of a private company with an unpaid present entitlement

      * Payments

      * (1) Section 109XB applies if:

       * (a) a trustee makes a payment (including a payment through an interposed entity as described in section 109XF) to a shareholder or an associate of a shareholder of a private company (except a shareholder or associate that is a company) (the **_actual transaction_**); and

       * (b) the payment is a discharge of or a reduction in a present entitlement of the shareholder or associate that is wholly or partly attributable to an amount that is an unrealised gain; and

       * (c) either:

        * (i) the company is presently entitled to an amount from the net income of the trust estate at the time the actual transaction takes place, and the whole of that amount has not been paid to the company before the earlier of the due date for lodgment and the date of lodgment of the trustee's return of income for the trust for the year of income of the trust in which the actual transaction takes place; or

        * (ii) the company becomes presently entitled to an amount from the net income of the trust estate after the actual transaction takes place, but before the earlier of the due date for lodgment and the date of lodgment of the trustee's return of income for the trust for the year of income of the trust in which the actual transaction takes place, and the whole of the amount has not been paid to the company before the earlier of those dates.

            * Note: For entitlements through interposed trusts, see section 109XI.

      * Loan repayments

      * (1A) Disregard paragraph (1)(b) if:

       * (b) the shareholder, or an associate of the shareholder, makes a loan or loans to the trustee on or after 1 July 2009; and

        * (ii) the shareholder, or an associate of the shareholder, made the loan or loans to the trustee before the time the original transaction took place and a reasonable person would conclude (having regard to all the circumstances) that the trustee obtained the loan or loans in order to make the payment; and

       * (d) the actual transaction is applied to repay all or a part of the loan or loans.

      * (1B) For the purposes of applying section 109XB in a case covered by subsections (1) and (1A) of this section, disregard section 109J (Payments discharging pecuniary obligations not treated as dividends).

      * Loans

      * (2) Section 109XB applies if:

       * (a) a trustee makes a loan (including a loan through an interposed entity as described in section 109XG) to a shareholder or an associate of a shareholder of a private company (except a shareholder or associate that is a company) (the **_actual transaction_**); and

       * (b) either:

        * (i) the company is presently entitled to an amount from the net income of the trust estate at the time the actual transaction takes place, and the whole of that amount has not been paid to the company before the earlier of the due date for lodgment and the date of lodgment of the trustee's return of income for the trust for the year of income of the trust in which the actual transaction takes place; or

        * (ii) the company becomes presently entitled to an amount from the net income of the trust estate after the actual transaction takes place, but before the earlier of the due date for lodgment and the date of lodgment of the trustee's return of income for the trust for the year of income of the trust in which the actual transaction takes place, and the whole of the amount has not been paid to the company before the earlier of those dates.

      * (3) Section 109XB applies if:

       * (a) all or part of a debt owed to a trustee by a shareholder or an associate of a shareholder of a private company is forgiven (except where the shareholder or associate is a company) (the **_actual transaction_**); and

       * (b) either:

        * (ii) the company becomes presently entitled to an amount from the net income of the trust estate after the actual transaction takes place, but before the earlier of the due date for lodgment and the date of lodgment of the trustee's return of income for the trust for the year of income of the trust in which the actual transaction takes place, and the whole of the amount has not been paid to the company before the earlier of those dates.

            * Note: For entitlements through interposed trusts, see section 109XI.

      * Amount involved in the actual transaction

      * (4) The amount involved in the actual transaction is the lesser of:

       * (a) the amount actually involved in the actual transaction; and

       * (b) the amount worked out using the formula:

       * where: 

       * **_previous transactions _**means the sum of:

        * (a) the amounts that, because of previous applications of section 109UB (as in force before the commencement of this section) have been taken to be loans; and

        * (b) the amounts that, because of previous applications of this Subdivision, have been included in an entity's assessable income;

       * in relation to the unpaid present entitlement.

       * **_unpaid present entitlement _**means:

        * (a) in a case mentioned in subparagraph (1)(c)(i), (2)(b)(i) or (3)(b)(i)--the amount of the present entitlement that remained unpaid on the earlier of the dates mentioned in that subparagraph; and

        * (b) in a case mentioned in subparagraph (1)(c)(ii), (2)(b)(ii) or (3)(b)(ii)--the amount of the present entitlement that remained unpaid on the earlier of the dates mentioned in that subparagraph.

      * The amount of the actual transaction where the entitlement is only partly attributable to an unrealised gain

      * (5) For the purposes of subsection (4), where the actual transaction was a payment and that payment was only partly attributable to an amount that is an unrealised gain, the amount of the actual transaction is taken to be the amount of the payment that was attributable to the amount that is the unrealised gain.

      * Creation of a present entitlement is not a payment

      * (6) The creation of a present entitlement to the capital or income of a trust estate is not, of itself, a payment for the purposes of this Subdivision.

      * Meaning of **unrealised gain**

      * **	(7)	In this section:

      * **_unrealised gain_**, in relation to a trust estate and an actual payment, means any unrealised gain, whether of a capital or income nature, but does not include an unrealised gain to the extent that it has been or would be included in the assessable income of the trust, apart from this Division, for:

       * (a) a year of income before the year in which the actual payment was made; or

       * (b) the year of income in which the actual payment was made; or

       * (c) the year of income following the year in which the actual payment was made.

##### 109XB  Amounts included in assessable income

      * (1) An amount is included, as if it were a dividend paid by the company at the end of the year of income of the company in which the actual transaction took place, in the assessable income of the shareholder or associate referred to in subsection 109XA(1), (2) or (3) if:

       * (a) had the actual transaction been done by a private company (the **_notional company_**); and

       * (b) had the shareholder or associate been a shareholder of the notional company at the time the actual transaction took place;

      * an amount (the **_Division 7A amount_**) would have been included in the shareholder's or associate's assessable income because of a provision of this Division outside this Subdivision.

      * (2) Subject to section 109Y, the amount that is included under subsection (1) is the Division 7A amount.

          * Note: There are some modifications of this Division for the purposes of working out the Division 7A amount: see section 109XC.

##### 109XC  Modifications

      * Modifications for this Subdivision only

      * (1) The modifications in this section have effect for the purposes of the operation of this Subdivision.

      * General modifications

      * (2) This Division (but not this Subdivision) applies to an actual transaction done by a trustee of a trust estate with these modifications:

       * (a) a reference (except in section 109Y) to an amount paid to a private company has effect as a reference to an amount paid to the trustee; and

       * (b) a reference to a year of income of a private company has effect as a reference to the corresponding year of income of the trust estate; and

       * (c) a reference to the ordinary course of a private company's business has effect as a reference to the ordinary course of the trust estate's business.

      * Modified operation of section 109J

      * (4) Section 109J does not apply to a payment to the extent that it is a discharge of or a reduction in a present entitlement.

      * Modified operation of section 109R

      * (6) For the purposes of applying section 109R to an actual transaction:

       * (a) a reference in that section to obtaining a loan from a private company has effect as a reference to obtaining a loan from the trustee; and

       * (b) a reference in that section to property transferred to a private company has effect as a reference to property transferred to the trustee; and

       * (c) a reference in that section to an amount paid by a private company for a transfer of property has effect as a reference to an amount paid by the trustee for a transfer of property.

      * Modified operation of section 109Y

      * (7) Section 109Y applies to the Division 7A amount in this way:

       * (a) assume that the private company referred to in subsection 109XA(1), (2) or (3) had been taken to have paid a dividend to the shareholder or associate referred to in that subsection equal to the Division 7A amount; and

       * (b) assume that the dividend was taken to have been paid at the end of the year of income of the company in which the actual transaction took place; and

       * (c) a reference in that section to a private company's distributable surplus has effect as a reference to the distributable surplus of the private company referred to in paragraph (a).

      * Certain provisions do not apply

      * (8) Subsection 109D(1A), sections 109K, 109NA and 109NB and paragraph 109R(3)(a) do not apply to an actual transaction.

##### 109XD  Forgiveness of loan debt does not give rise to assessable income if loan gives rise to assessable income

      * An amount is not included in the assessable income for a year of income of the shareholder or associate referred to in subsection 109XA(3) because of the forgiveness of an amount of a debt resulting from a loan if, because of the loan, an amount was included in the assessable income of the shareholder or associate under section 109XB (or former section 109UB) in that or an earlier year of income.

##### Subdivision EB--Unpaid present entitlements--interposed entities

##### 109XE  Simplified outline of this Subdivision

      * The following is a simplified outline of this Subdivision: 

Payments and loans

      * This Subdivision allows an amount to be included in an entity's (the **_target entity's_**) assessable income under Subdivision EA if an entity interposed between a trustee and the target entity makes a payment or loan to the target entity under an arrangement involving the trustee.

      * This result is achieved by treating the trustee as making a payment or loan of an amount determined by the Commissioner to the target entity.

      * The arrangement must involve the trustee and one or more interposed entities in making payments or loans for the purpose of the target entity receiving a payment or loan from an interposed entity.

      * If the target entity repays a fraction of the loan made by the interposed entity, the target entity is treated as repaying the same fraction of the loan taken to have been made by the trustee.

      * Some provisions that prevent payments or loans from giving rise to assessable income do not apply to payments or loans this Subdivision treats a trustee as making.

Present entitlements

      * This Subdivision similarly allows an amount to be included in an entity's assessable income under Subdivision EA if a private company is or becomes presently entitled to an amount from the net income of a trust estate interposed between the private company and another trust estate (the **_target trust_**) under an arrangement involving the target trust.

##### 109XF  Payments through interposed entities

      * (1) For the purposes of paragraphs 109XA(1)(a) and (1A)(a), a trustee is taken to have made a payment to a shareholder, or to an associate of a shareholder, (the **_target entity_**) of a private company if:

       * (a) the trustee makes a payment or loan to another entity (the **_first interposed entity_**) that is interposed between:

        * (i) the trustee; and

        * (ii) the target entity; and

       * (b) a reasonable person would conclude (having regard to all the circumstances) that the trustee made the payment or loan solely or mainly as part of an arrangement involving a payment to the target entity; and

       * (c) either:

        * (i) the first interposed entity makes a payment to the target entity; or

        * (ii) another entity interposed between the trustee and the target entity makes a payment to the target entity.

      * (2) For the purposes of this section, it does not matter:

       * (a) whether the interposed entity made the payment to the target entity before, after or at the same time as the first interposed entity received the payment or loan from the trustee; or

       * (b) whether or not the interposed entity paid the target entity the same amount as the trustee paid or lent the first interposed entity.

      * (3) Treat the reference in paragraph 109XA(1)(b) to a payment as being a reference to the payment to the target entity mentioned in paragraph (1)(c) of this section.

##### 109XG  Loans through interposed entities

      * Loans by a trustee through interposed entities

      * (1) For the purposes of paragraph 109XA(2)(a), a trustee is taken to have made a loan (the **_notional loan_**) to a shareholder, or to an associate of a shareholder, (the **_target entity_**) of a private company if:

       * (a) the trustee makes a payment or loan to another entity (the **_first interposed entity_**) that is interposed between:

        * (i) the trustee; and

        * (ii) the target entity; and

       * (b) a reasonable person would conclude (having regard to all the circumstances) that the trustee made the payment or loan solely or mainly as part of an arrangement involving a loan to the target entity; and

       * (c) either:

        * (i) the first interposed entity makes a loan to the target entity; or

        * (ii) another entity interposed between the trustee and the target entity makes a loan to the target entity.

      * (2) For the purposes of this section, it does not matter:

       * (a) whether the interposed entity made the loan to the target entity before, after or at the same time as the first interposed entity received the payment or loan from the trustee; or

       * (b) whether or not the interposed entity lent the target entity the same amount as the trustee paid or lent the first interposed entity.

      * Notional loans

      * (3) When working out whether an amount is included in the assessable income of the target entity under section 109XB as a result of the notional loan under subsection (1) of this section, and the amount included in assessable income, assume that the target entity repays an amount of the notional loan equal to the amount worked out using the formula:

      * where: 

      * **_amount actually lent to target entity_** is the amount the interposed entity lent to the target entity.

      * **_repayment made by target entity to lender_** is the amount of any repayment made by the target entity of the loan the interposed entity made to the target entity.

      * (4) For the purposes of section 109E (Amalgamated loan from a previous year treated as dividend if minimum repayment not made):

       * (a) treat the notional loan as an amalgamated loan from the private company to the target entity; and

       * (b) treat the amount of the notional loan worked out under section 109XH as the amount of the amalgamated loan; and

       * (c) treat the agreement under which the actual loan was made as the agreement under which the amalgamated loan was made; and

       * (d) treat repayments by the target entity of the amount of the notional loan worked out under subsection (3) of this section as payments by the target entity to the private company in relation to the amalgamated loan.

      * (5) For the purposes of section 109N (about certain loans not being treated as dividends), treat the agreement under which the actual loan was made as the agreement under which the notional loan was made.

##### 109XH  Amount and timing of payment or loan through interposed entities

      * Amount of payment or loan

      * (1) The amount the trustee is taken under section 109XF or 109XG to have paid or lent the target entity is the amount (if any) determined by the Commissioner.

      * (2) In determining the amount of the payment or loan, the Commissioner must take account of:

       * (a) the amount the interposed entity paid or lent the target entity; and

       * (b) how much (if any) of that amount the Commissioner believes represented consideration payable to the target entity by:

        * (i) the trustee; or

        * (ii) any of the interposed entities;

       * for anything (assuming that the consideration payable equals that for similar transactions at arm's length).

      * (3) The total of the amounts determined under subsection (1) for payments and loans in relation to which section 109XB applies because of the same present entitlement mentioned in paragraph 109XA(1)(c), (2)(b) or (3)(b) must not exceed the unpaid present entitlement mentioned in subsection 109XA(4).

      * Timing of payment or loan

      * (4) The trustee is taken under section 109XF or 109XG to have made the payment or loan at the time the interposed entity made the payment or loan mentioned in paragraph 109XF(1)(c) or 109XG(1)(c) to the target entity.

##### 109XI  Entitlements to trust income through interposed trusts

      * Entitlements through interposed trusts

      * (1) For the purposes of paragraphs 109XA(1)(c), (2)(b) and (3)(b), a private company is taken to be or to become entitled to an amount from the net income of a trust estate (the **_target trust_**) if:

       * (a) the company is or becomes presently entitled to an amount from the net income of another trust estate (the **_first interposed trust_**) that is interposed between the target trust and the company; and

       * (b) a reasonable person would conclude (having regard to all the circumstances) that the company is or becomes so entitled solely or mainly as part of an arrangement involving an entitlement to an amount from the target trust; and

       * (c) either:

        * (i) the first interposed trust is or becomes presently entitled to an amount from the net income of the target trust; or

        * (ii) another trust interposed between the target trust and the company is or becomes presently entitled to an amount from the net income of the target trust.

      * This section operates regardless of certain factors

      * (2) For the purposes of this section, it does not matter:

       * (a) whether the company became or becomes entitled to the amount from the net income of the first interposed trust before, after or at the same time as the interposed trust became or becomes presently entitled to an amount from the net income of the target trust; or

       * (b) whether or not the company became presently entitled to the same amount as the amount to which the interposed trust become entitled.

      * This section does not operate to the extent Subdivision EA would otherwise apply

      * (3) Subsection (1) does not apply to the extent that an amount is included in the assessable income of a shareholder, or an associate of a shareholder, of the company under Subdivision EA (as it applies apart from this section) as a result of the present entitlement of any interposed trust.

      * Amount of entitlement

      * (4) The amount the private company is taken to be or to become entitled to from the net income of the target trust is the amount (if any) determined by the Commissioner.

      * (5) The total amount determined under subsection (4) for present entitlements to which that subsection applies because of the same present entitlement to an amount from the net income of the target trust mentioned in paragraph (1)(c) must not exceed that amount.

      * (6) In determining the amount of the entitlement, the Commissioner must take account of:

       * (a) the amount the private company is or becomes entitled to from the net income of the first interposed trust; and

       * (b) how much (if any) of that amount the Commissioner believes represented consideration payable to the private company by:

        * (i) the target trust; or

        * (ii) any of the interposed trusts;

       * for anything (assuming that the consideration payable equals that for similar transactions at arm's length).

      * Timing of entitlement

      * (7) The company is taken to be or to become entitled to the amount from the net income of the target trust at the time the company is or becomes entitled to the amount from the net income of the first interposed trust mentioned in paragraph (1)(a).

##### Subdivision F--General rules applying to all amounts treated as dividends

##### 109Y  Proportional reduction of dividends so they do not exceed distributable surplus

      * Reduction of amounts of dividends

      * (1) If, apart from this section, the sum of all the dividends a private company is taken under this Division to pay at the end of the year of income would be more than the company's distributable surplus for that year, the amount of each of those dividends is the amount worked out under subsection (3).

      * Distributable surplus

      * (2) A private company's **_distributable surplus_** for its year of income is the amount worked out using the formula:

      * where: 

      * **_Division 7A amounts_** is the total of any amounts the company is taken under section 109C or 109F to have paid as dividends in the year of income apart from this section.

      * **_net assets_** means the amount (if any), at the end of the company's year of income, by which the company's assets (according to the company's accounting records) exceed the sum of:

       * (a) the present legal obligations of the company to persons other than the company; and

       * (b) the following provisions (according to the company's accounting records):

        * (i) provisions for depreciation;

        * (ii) provisions for annual leave and long service leave;

        * (iii) provisions for amortisation of intellectual property and trade marks;

        * (iv) other provisions prescribed under regulations made for the purposes of this subparagraph.

      * If the Commissioner considers that the company's accounting records significantly undervalue or overvalue its assets or undervalue or overvalue its provisions, the Commissioner may substitute a value that the Commissioner considers is appropriate.

      * **_noncommercial loans_** means the total of:

       * (a) any amounts that:

        * (i) the company is taken under former section 108, or section 109D or 109E, to have paid as dividends in earlier years of income; and

        * (ii) are shown as assets in the company's accounting records at the end of year of income; and

       * (b) any amounts that are included in the assessable income of shareholders, or associates of shareholders, of the company under section 109XB as if the amounts were dividends paid by the company in earlier years of income.

          * Note: The total amount worked out under paragraph (b) might be reduced under subsection (2A).

      * **_paidup share value_** is the paidup share capital of the company at the end of its year of income.

      * **_repayments of noncommercial loans_** means the total of:

       * (a) any repayments to the company of loans or amounts that have been taken by former section 108, or section 109D or 109E, to be dividends; and

       * (b) amounts set off against loans that have been taken by former section 108, or section 109D or 109E, to be dividends, other than such amounts that are set off as a result of:

        * (i) a dividend (being a later dividend for the purposes of section 109ZC or a subsequent dividend for the purposes of former subsection 108(2)) being paid by the company to the extent of the unfranked part of the dividend; or

        * (ii) a loan, or a part of a loan, being forgiven.

      * (2A) Reduce the total of the amounts worked out under paragraph (b) of the definition of **_noncommercial loans_** in subsection (2) by the total of the unfranked parts of any dividends:

       * (a) that are distributed by the company; and

       * (b) to which section 109ZCA applies.

      * (3) The amount of a dividend that a private company is taken under this Division to pay is worked out using the formula:

      * where: 

      * **_provisional dividend_** is the amount of the dividend that the private company would be taken to pay apart from this section.

      * **_total of provisional dividends_** is the sum of all the dividends the private company is taken under this Division to pay at the end of the year of income apart from this section.

      * Requirement for private company to provide statement

      * (4) If this section sets the amount of a dividend taken under this Division to be paid by a private company to an entity at the end of a year of income, the private company must give the entity a written statement as soon as possible after the end of the year of income.

      * What the statement must contain

      * (5) The statement must set out:

       * (a) the private company's distributable surplus for the year of income; and

       * (b) the total amount the company would be taken under this Division to pay as dividends in the year of income apart from this section.

##### 109Z  Characteristics of dividends taken to be paid under this Division

      * If a private company is taken under this Division to have paid a dividend to an entity, the dividend is taken for the purposes of this Act to be paid:

       * (a) to the entity as a shareholder in the private company; and

       * (b) out of the private company's profits.

##### 109ZA  No dividend taken to be paid for withholding tax purposes

      * If a private company is taken under this Division to have paid a dividend to an entity, disregard the dividend for the purposes of:

       * (a) Division 11A of Part III (which deals with withholding tax on dividends paid to nonresidents and some other people); and

       * (c) Subdivision 12F in Schedule 1 to the _Taxation Administration Act 1953_ (which deals with PAYG withholding).

##### 109ZB  Amount treated as dividend is not a fringe benefit

      * (1) This Division applies to a loan of an amount to an entity by a private company, even if the loan is made:

       * (a) to the entity in its capacity as an employee (as defined in the _Fringe Benefits Tax Assessment Act 1986_) or an associate of such an employee; or

       * (b) in respect of the employment of an employee (as defined in that Act).

          * Note: This helps ensure that a loan is not a fringe benefit for the purposes of that Act.

      * (2) This Division applies to a private company's forgiveness of a debt owed by an entity to the private company, even if:

       * (a) the entity owed the debt in its capacity as an employee (as defined in the _Fringe Benefits Tax Assessment Act 1986_) or an associate of such an employee; or

       * (b) the forgiveness occurs in respect of the employment of an employee (as defined in that Act).

          * Note: This helps ensure that the forgiveness of a debt is not a fringe benefit for the purposes of that Act.

      * (3) However, this Division does not apply to a payment made to a shareholder, or an associate of a shareholder, in their capacity as an employee (as defined in the _Fringe Benefits Tax Assessment Act 1986_) or an associate of such an employee.

##### 109ZC  Treatment of dividend that is reduced on account of an amount taken under this Division to be a dividend

      * (1) This section sets out special rules for dealing with a dividend (the **_later dividend_**) distributed by a private company if some or all of the later dividend is set off against some or all of an amount taken under this Division to be a dividend previously paid by the company.

          * Example: Some or all of a dividend distributed by a private company to a shareholder might be set off to reduce a loan the company had previously made to the shareholder that was treated as a dividend under Subdivision B.

      * (1A) This section also sets out special rules for dealing with a dividend (also the **_later dividend_**) distributed by a private company if:

       * (a) the private company distributes the later dividend to a shareholder in the company; and

       * (b) the shareholder applies the amount of the dividend to repay all or part of a loan:

        * (i) that was obtained from the private company by an associate of the shareholder; and

        * (ii) in relation to which a dividend was previously taken under this Division to have been paid by the private company.

      * (2) The amount of the later dividend set off or applied is taken not to be a dividend for the purposes of this Act, except Part 36 of the _Income Tax Assessment Act 1997_ (which deals with franking of distributions). However, if the amount set off or applied exceeds the amount of the later dividend that is not either the franked part of that dividend, or the part of that dividend that has been franked with an exempting credit, the excess is still a dividend.

          * Note: This prevents double taxation by ensuring that the entity's assessable income does not include the amount of the later dividend that is not paid to the entity (except to the extent that that amount is franked).

      * (3) An amount that is taken not to be a dividend under subsection (2) is not assessable income and is not exempt income.

##### 109ZCA  Treatment of dividend that is reduced on account of an amount included in assessable income under Subdivision EA

      * (1) This section sets out special rules for dealing with a dividend (the **_later dividend_**) distributed by a private company if:

       * (a) an amount is included in the assessable income of a shareholder, or an associate of a shareholder, of the company under section 109XB because of a loan made to the shareholder or associate by a trustee in relation to a present entitlement of the company to an amount from the net income of the trust estate; and

       * (b) subsection 109XA(2) applied to the loan; and

       * (c) some or all of the later dividend is applied to repay all or a part of the loan.

      * (2) The amount of the later dividend applied is taken not to be a dividend for the purposes of this Act, except Part 36 of the _Income Tax Assessment Act 1997_ (which deals with franking of distributions).

      * (3) However, if the amount set off or applied exceeds the amount of the later dividend that is neither:

       * (a) the franked part of that dividend; nor

       * (b) the part of that dividend that has been franked with an exempting credit;

      * the excess is still a dividend.

          * Note: This prevents double taxation by ensuring that the entity's assessable income does not include the amount of the later dividend that is not paid to the entity (except to the extent that that amount is franked).

      * (4) An amount that is taken not to be a dividend under subsection (2) is not assessable income and is not exempt income.

      * Investment return assumption

      * (9) In working out the existing business value or the adjusted net worth, it is to be assumed that the annual rate of return on each investment of the company is:

       * (a) if the investment is a security with a term less than 2 years or is cash--the Treasury bond rate (see subsection 121AO(1)) for the applicable accounting day in respect of bonds with a 26 week term; or

       * (b) if the investment is any other kind of security--the Treasury bond rate for the applicable accounting day in respect of bonds with a 10 year term; or

       * (c) in any other case--the rate mentioned in paragraph (b), plus 3%.

       * (b) will distribute all of its profits except to the extent necessary for its capital reserves not to fall below the capital reserve adequacy level.

      * reduced by: 

       * (b) the amount of its liabilities (including future liabilities) arising from its business conducted before that day.

      * Australian accounting practice

      * (2) The amount of the company's assets and liabilities (other than future liabilities) is to be worked out according to Australian accounting practice.

      * Eligible actuary and Australian actuarial practice

      * (3) The amount of the company's future liabilities is to be worked out by an eligible actuary (see subsection 121AO(3)) according to Australian actuarial practice.

      * Applicable accounting day

      * Adjustment for changes after applicable accounting day

      * (5) In a case covered by paragraph (4)(b), if any significant change in the amount of the company's assets or liabilities occurs between the applicable accounting day and the demutualisation resolution day, that amount is to be adjusted to take account of the change.
