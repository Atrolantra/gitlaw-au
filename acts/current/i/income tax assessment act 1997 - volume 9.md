##### Basic entitlement rule for foreign income tax offset

##### 77010  Entitlement to foreign income tax offset

    * (1) You are entitled to a *tax offset for an income year for *foreign income tax. An amount of foreign income tax counts towards the tax offset for the year if you paid it in respect of an amount that is all or part of an amount included in your assessable income for the year.

         * Note 1: The offset is for the income year in which your assessable income included an amount in respect of which you paid foreign income tax--even if you paid the foreign income tax in another income year.

         * Note 2: If the foreign income tax has been paid on an amount that is part nonassessable nonexempt income and part assessable income for you for the income year, only a proportionate share of the foreign income tax (the share that corresponds to the part that is assessable income) will count towards the tax offset (excluding the operation of subsection (2)).

         * Note 3: For offshore banking units, the amount of foreign income tax paid in respect of offshore banking income is reduced: see subsection 121EG(3A) of the _Income Tax Assessment Act 1936._

    * _Taxes paid on section 23AI or 23AK amounts

    * (2) An amount of *foreign income tax counts towards the *tax offset for you for the year if you paid it in respect of an amount that is your *nonassessable nonexempt income under either section 23AI or 23AK of the _Income Tax Assessment Act 1936 _for the year.

         * Note 1: Sections 23AI and 23AK of the _Income Tax Assessment Act 1936_ provide that amounts paid out of income previously attributed from a controlled foreign company or a foreign investment fund are nonassessable nonexempt income.

         * Note 2: Foreign income taxes covered by this subsection are direct taxes (for example, a withholding tax on a dividend payment) and not underlying taxes, only some of which are covered by section 770135.

    * Exception for certain residencebased foreign income taxes

    * (3) An amount of *foreign income tax you paid does not count towards the *tax offset for the year if you paid it:

     * (a) to a foreign country because you are a resident of that country for the purposes of a law relating to the foreign income tax; and

     * (b) in respect of an amount derived from a source outside that country.

    * Exception for previously complying funds and previously foreign funds

    * (4) An amount of *foreign income tax paid by a *superannuation provider in relation to a *superannuation fund does not count towards the *tax offset for the year if:

     * (a) the tax was paid in respect of an amount included in the fund's assessable income under table item 2 or 3 in section 295320; and

     * (b) the provider paid the tax before the start of the income year.

         * Note: Table items 2 and 3 in section 295320 include additional amounts in the assessable income of superannuation funds that change their status from complying to noncomplying or from foreign to Australian.

    * Exception for credit absorption tax and unitary tax

    * (5) An amount of *credit absorption tax or *unitary tax you paid does not count towards the *tax offset for the year.

##### 77015  Meaning of foreign income tax, credit absorption tax and unitary tax

    * (1) **_Foreign income tax _**means tax that:

     * (a) is imposed by a law other than an *Australian law; and

     * (b) is:

       * (i) tax on income; or

       * (ii) tax on profits or gains, whether of an income or capital nature; or

       * (iii) any other tax, being a tax that is subject to an agreement having the force of law under the _International Tax Agreements Act 1953_.

         * Note: Foreign income tax includes only that which has been correctly imposed in accordance with the relevant foreign law or, where the foreign jurisdiction has a tax treaty with  (having the force of law under the _International Tax Agreements Act 1953_), has been correctly imposed in accordance with that tax treaty.

    * (2) **_Credit absorption tax_** means a tax imposed by a law of a foreign country, or of any part of, or place in, a foreign country to the extent that the tax would not have been payable if the entity concerned or another entity had not been entitled to an offset in respect of the tax under this Division.

    * (3) **_Unitary tax_** means a tax imposed by a law of a foreign country, or of any part of, or place in, a foreign country, being a law which, for the purposes of taxing income, profits or gains of a company derived from sources within that country, takes into account, or is entitled to take into account, income, losses, outgoings or assets of the company (or of a company that for the purposes of that law is treated as being associated with the company) derived, incurred or situated outside that country, but does not include tax imposed by that law if that law only takes those matters into account:

     * (a) if such an associated company is a resident of the foreign country for the purposes of the law of the foreign country; or

     * (b) for the purposes of granting any form of relief in relation to tax imposed on dividends received by one company from another company.

##### Subdivision 770B--Amount of foreign income tax offset

##### Guide to Subdivision 770B

##### 77065  What this Subdivision is about

    * The amount of your tax offset is based on the amount of foreign income tax you have paid.

    * However, there is a limit on the maximum amount of your offset. The limit is the greater of $1,000 and an amount worked out under this Subdivision. This amount is based on a comparison between your tax liability and the tax liability you would have if certain foreigntaxed and foreignsourced income and related deductions were disregarded.

    * You may choose to use the limit of $1,000 and not work out this amount.

    * There is an increase in the limit to ensure foreign income tax paid on some amounts that are not taxed always forms part of the offset.

##### Operative provisions

##### 77070  Amount of foreign income tax offset

    * The amount of your *tax offset for the year is the sum of the *foreign income tax you paid that counts towards the offset for the year.

         * Note 1: The amount of foreign income tax you paid may be affected by Subdivision 770C.

         * Note 2: The amount of the offset might be increased under section 770230 of the _Income Tax (Transitional Provisions) Act 1997_, if you have precommencement excess foreign income tax.

##### 77075  Foreign income tax offset limit

    * (1) There is a limit (the **_offset limit_**) on the amount of your *tax offset for a year. If your tax offset exceeds the offset limit, reduce the offset by the amount of the excess.

    * (2) Your offset limit is the greater of:

     * (a) $1,000; and

     * (b) this amount:

       * (i) the amount of income tax payable by you for the income year; _less_

       * _	(ii)	the amount of income tax that would be payable by you for the income year if the assumptions in subsection (4) were made.

         * Note 1: If you do not intend to claim a foreign income tax offset of more than $1,000 for the year, you do not need to work out the amount under paragraph (b).

         * Note 2: The amount of the offset limit might be increased under section 77080.

    * (3) For the purposes of paragraph (2)(b), work out the amount of income tax payable by you, or that would be payable by you, disregarding any *tax offsets.

    * (4) Assume that:

     * (a) your assessable income did not include:

       * (i) so much of any amount included in your assessable income as represents an amount in respect of which you paid *foreign income tax that counts towards the *tax offset for the year; and

       * (ii) any other amounts of *ordinary income or *statutory income from a source other than an *Australian source; and

     * (b) you were not entitled to any deductions that:

       * (i) are *debt deductions that are attributable to an *overseas permanent establishment of yours; or

       * (ii) are deductions (other than debt deductions) that are reasonably related to amounts covered by paragraph (a) for that year.

         * Example: If an entity has paid foreign income tax on a capital gain that comprises part of its net capital gain, only that capital gain on which foreign income tax has been paid is disregarded.

##### 77080  Increase in offset limit for tax paid on amounts to which section 23AI or 23AK of the Income Tax Assessment Act 1936 apply

    * Your offset limit under subsection 77075(2) is increased by any amounts of *foreign income tax that count towards the *tax offset for you for the year because of subsection 77010(2).

##### Rules about when foreign tax is paid

##### 770130  When foreign income tax is considered paid--taxes paid by someone else

    * (1) This Act applies to you as if you had paid an amount of *foreign income tax in respect of an amount (a **_taxed amount_**) that is all or part of an amount included in your *ordinary income or *statutory income if you are covered by subsection (2) or (3) for an amount of foreign income tax paid in respect of the taxed amount.

    * (2) You are covered by this subsection for an amount of *foreign income tax paid in respect of a taxed amount if that foreign income tax has been paid in respect of the taxed amount by another entity under an *arrangement with you or under the law relating to the foreign income tax.

         * Example: You are a partner in a partnership and the partnership pays foreign income tax on the partnership income.

    * (3) You are covered by this subsection for an amount of *foreign income tax paid in respect of the taxed amount to the extent that:

     * (a) the taxed amount is taken, because of section 6B of the _Income Tax Assessment Act 1936_ (the **_1936 Act_**), to be attributable to another amount of income of a particular kind or source; and

     * (b) foreign income tax has been paid in respect of the other amount of income; and

     * (c) the taxed amount is less than it would have been if that tax had not been paid.

         * Example: Aust Co (an Australian resident) is the sole beneficiary of an Australian resident trust H and is presently entitled to all the income of trust H. Trust H owns shares in For Co (a foreign company). For Co pays a dividend to trust H and the dividend is subject to withholding tax in For Co's country of residence.

         * Trust H allocates to Aust Co, the dividend, as well as other Australian source income trust H earned in the year (none of which was subject to foreign income tax). Aust Co is treated as having paid the foreign income tax paid by For Co under subsection 770130(3). The foreign income tax is treated as paid in respect of the amount included in Aust Co's assessable income that is attributable to the dividend.

##### 770135  Foreign income tax paid by CFCs on attributed amounts

    * (1) This Division applies to an entity (other than a *CFC) as if it had paid an amount of *foreign income tax worked out under subsection (7) in respect of an amount included in its assessable income if:

     * (a) the amount is included in its assessable income as described in subsection (2); and

     * (b) the conditions in subsections (3), (5) and (6) are satisfied.

    * (2) An amount is included in an entity's assessable income as described in this subsection if the entity is a company and the amount is included under:

     * (a) section 456 (a **_section 456 case_**) of the 1936 Act in relation to a *CFC and a statutory accounting period; or

     * (b) section 457 (a **_section 457 case_**) of that Act in relation to a CFC.

         * Note: Section 456 of the 1936 Act includes, in the assessable income of certain Australian shareholders, amounts that are attributable to the profits of an Australiancontrolled foreign company.

         * Section 457 does likewise when a controlled foreign company changes residence from an unlisted to a listed country or to Australia.

    * Tax paid condition

    * (3) An amount of *foreign income tax, income tax or *withholding tax (the **_tax amount_**) must have been paid:

     * (a) for a section 456 case--by the *CFC in respect of an amount included in the notional assessable income of the CFC for the statutory accounting period; or

     * (b) for a section 457 case--by the CFC.

         * Note: Section 770130 deems foreign income tax to have been paid in certain circumstances.

    * (4) For the purposes of paragraphs (3)(a) and (b), the tax amount includes an amount that is taken to have been paid by the *CFC under subsection 393(4) of the 1936 Act (about tax paid on reinsurance premiums).

    * Association condition

    * (5) If the entity is a company, it must have an *attribution percentage of 10% or more:

     * (a) for a section 456 case--in relation to the *CFC at the end of the statutory accounting period; or

     * (b) for a section 457 case--in relation to the CFC at the residencechange time (within the meaning of section 457 of the 1936 Act).

    * Amount of foreign income tax

    * (7) The amount worked out under this subsection is:

     * (a) for a section 456 case--the sum of all the tax amounts for the statutory accounting period multiplied by the company's *attribution percentage in relation to the *CFC at the time mentioned in paragraph (5)(a); or

     * (b) for a section 457 case--the sum of all the tax amounts to the extent they are attributable to the amount included in the company's assessable income under section 457 of the 1936 Act.

    * Grossingup of attributed amount

    * (8) For the purposes of this Act except this section and section 371 of the 1936 Act (for a section 456 case or a section 457 case), the amount included in the entity's assessable income as described in subsection (2) is taken to be increased by the amount of tax worked out under subsection (7).

         * Note: Section 371 of the 1936 Act records an amount in an attribution account when the amount is included in the assessable income of an attributable taxpayer in relation to a CFC.

##### Rules about when foreign tax is considered not paid

##### 770140  When foreign income tax is considered not paid--antiavoidance rule

    * Despite anything else in this Division, this Act applies to you as if you had _not_ paid an amount of *foreign income tax to the extent that you or any other entity become entitled to:

##### Operative provisions

##### 80210  Objects

    * The objects of this Subdivision are: 

     * (a) to encourage the establishment in  of regional holding companies for foreign groups; and

     * (b) to improve 's attractiveness as a continuing base for its multinational companies;

    * by providing relief from tax on *distributions by *Australian corporate tax entities to *members who are foreign residents or other Australian corporate tax entities if those distributions relate to *conduit foreign income.

##### 80215  Foreign residents--exempting CFI from Australian tax

    * (1) So much of the *unfranked part of a *frankable distribution made by an *Australian corporate tax entity that the entity declares, in its *distribution statement, to be *conduit foreign income:

     * (a) is not assessable income and is not *exempt income of a foreign resident; and

     * (b) is an amount to which section 128B (Liability to withholding tax) of the _Income Tax Assessment Act 1936_ does not apply.

    * (2) The declaration must be made on or before the day on which the *distribution is made.

         * Note: For a private company, this rule may bring forward the time at which the company is required to make its distribution statement: see section 20275.

##### 80217  Trust estates and foreign resident beneficiaries--exempting CFI from Australian tax

    * Foreign resident beneficiaries

    * (1) So much of a share of the net income of a trust as is reasonably attributable to the whole or a part of the *unfranked part of a *frankable distribution made by an *Australian corporate tax entity that the entity declares, in its *distribution statement, to be *conduit foreign income:

     * (a) is not assessable income and is not *exempt income of a beneficiary of the trust who:

       * (i) is a foreign resident; and

       * (ii) is presently entitled to the share of the income of the trust; and

     * (b) is an amount to which section 128B (Liability to withholding tax) of the _Income Tax Assessment Act 1936 _does not apply.

         * Note: A frankable distribution to which a part of the net income of a trust is reasonably attributable may be made by the Australian corporate tax entity to the trust directly, or to the trust indirectly through one or more interposed trusts.

    * (2) The declaration must be made on or before the day on which the *distribution is made.

         * Note: For a private company, this rule may bring forward the time at which the company is required to make its distribution statement: see section 20275.

    * Trusts

    * (3) The trustee of a trust is not to be assessed (and pay tax) under section 98, 99 or 99A of the _Income Tax Assessment Act 1936_ in respect of so much of the net income of the trust as is *nonassessable nonexempt income of a beneficiary of the trust under subsection (1).

##### 80220  Distributions between Australian corporate tax entities--nonassessable nonexempt income

    * (1) An *Australian corporate tax entity (the **_receiving entity_**) has an amount that is not assessable income and is not *exempt income for an income year if:

     * (a) it receives from another Australian corporate tax entity a *frankable distribution that has an *unfranked part; and

     * (b) the *distribution statement for the *distribution declares an amount (a **_received CFI amount_**) of the unfranked part to be *conduit foreign income; and

     * (c) the receiving entity, after the start of the income year but before the due day for lodging its *income tax return for that income year:

       * (i) makes a frankable distribution that has an unfranked part; and

       * (ii) declares an amount (a **_declared CFI amount_**) of the unfranked part to be conduit foreign income.

    * (2) The amount that is not assessable income and is not *exempt income is the lesser of:

     * (a) the sum of the received CFI amounts that the receiving entity receives during the income year (the **_total received CFI amounts_**); and

     * (b) the amount worked out using this formula:

    * where: 

    * **_related expenses_** means the receiving entity's expenses that are reasonably related to the total received CFI amounts.

    * **_total declared CFI amounts_** means the sum of the declared CFI amounts in distributions made by the receiving entity before the due day for lodging its *income tax return for the income year.

         * Example: AusCo 1 and AusCo 2 are both Australian corporate tax entities.

         * AusCo 1 pays an unfranked dividend of $80 to AusCo 2. AusCo 1 declares all of the $80 to be its conduit foreign income (so the $80 is a received CFI amount).

         * AusCo 2 has $5 of deductible expenses relating to the $80 dividend.

         * AusCo 2 pays an unfranked dividend of $30. AusCo 2 declares $15 of the $30 to be conduit foreign income (so the $15 is a declared CFI amount).

         * The amount that is not assessable income and is not exempt income for AusCo 2 (assuming there are no other received CFI amounts or declared CFI amounts) is:

         * The remaining $64 is included in AusCo 2's assessable income and it can deduct $4 (the part of the expenses related to the $64).

    * (3) If the receiving entity's expenses that are reasonably related to the total received CFI amounts equal or exceed the total received CFI amounts for an income year, the total received CFI amounts is not assessable income and is not *exempt income of the receiving entity for the income year.

    * (4) If a declared CFI amount is taken into account in working out an amount of *nonassessable nonexempt income of an entity for an income year, that amount cannot be taken into account for the entity for a later income year.

    * (5) Work out how much *conduit foreign income in a *frankable distribution flows through a trust or a partnership in the same way that you work out the *share of a *franking credit on a *franked distribution that flows through a trust or a partnership. That amount is treated as a received CFI amount under this section.

         * Note: See sections 20750, 20755 and 20757 for the share of a franking credit on a franked distribution that flows through a trust or a partnership.

##### 80225  Conduit foreign income of an Australian corporate tax entity

    * An *Australian corporate tax entity's **_conduit foreign income_** at a particular time (the **_relevant time_**) is worked out by applying sections 80230 to 80255.

         * Note: Subdivision 715U modifies the single entity and the entry history rule for the purposes of working out conduit foreign income for consolidated groups and MEC groups.

##### 80230  Foreign source income amounts

    * (1) Work out the amount of the entity's *ordinary income and *statutory income derived by the entity that has been, is or will be included in an income statement or similar statement of the entity or of another entity and that would not be included in the entity's assessable income if the entity:

     * (a) for a company or a *corporate limited partnership--were a foreign resident at the relevant time; or

     * (b) for a *corporate unit trust or *public trading trust--were not a *resident unit trust for the income year in which the relevant time occurs.

         * Note: Income statements are prepared under the Framework for the Preparation and Presentation of Financial Statements (which is referred to in the Australian Accounting Standards).

    * (2) Reduce the subsection (1) amount by any part of that amount that is or will be included in the entity's assessable income (apart from section 80220).

    * (3) Add to the amount remaining after subsection (2) these amounts:

     * (a) if the entity receives from another *Australian corporate tax entity a *frankable distribution that has an *unfranked part--any amount declared in the *distribution statement for that *distribution to be *conduit foreign income;

     * (b) an amount that is treated as a received CFI amount for the purposes of section 80220 because of subsection 80220(5);

     * (c) an amount that is *nonassessable nonexempt income under section 7685 and that would be not be included under subsection (1).

    * (4) Reduce the amount remaining after subsection (3) by these amounts:

     * (a) an amount that is *nonassessable nonexempt income under section 23AI or 23AK of the _Income Tax Assessment Act 1936_;

     * (b) an amount that is not included in the entity's assessable income because of the operation of paragraph 99B(2)(e) of that Act;

     * (c) the amount worked out using the formula:

     * where: 

     * **_available franking credit_** means any part of the amount remaining after subsection (3) to the extent to which a *franking credit arises or will arise for the entity.

    * (5) Reduce the amount remaining after subsection (4) by any of the entity's expenses that are reasonably related to that amount, except expenses the entity has deducted or can deduct under this Act. In applying this subsection to an amount covered by paragraph (3)(a), assume that amount is *nonassessable nonexempt income.

    * (6) The result is an amount included in the entity's **_conduit foreign income_**.

    * (7) This section applies to an entity as if it had derived an amount if the amount has been applied for its benefit (including by discharging all or part of a debt it owes) or as it directs.

##### 80235  Capital gains and losses

    * Capital gains

    * (1) The entity's **_conduit foreign income_** includes these amounts:

     * (a) the amount by which a *capital gain of the entity is reduced because of the operation of section 768505;

     * (b) a capital gain that is disregarded because of the operation of subsection 23AH(3) of the _Income Tax Assessment Act 1936_;

     * (c) the amount of a capital gain that is disregarded as a result of the operation of an *international tax sharing treaty.

    * Capital losses

    * (2) The entity's **_conduit foreign income_** is reduced by these amounts:

     * (a) the amount by which a *capital loss of the entity is reduced because of the operation of section 768505;

     * (b) a capital loss that is disregarded because of the operation of subsection 23AH(4) of the _Income Tax Assessment Act 1936_;

     * (c) the amount of a capital loss that is disregarded as a result of the operation of an *international tax sharing treaty.

    * Timing rule

    * (3) The adjustments are made under this section at the end of the income year in which the *CGT event occurred.

##### 80240  Effect of foreign income tax offset on conduit foreign income

    * The entity's **_conduit foreign income_** includes an amount if a tax offset arose for the entity under Division 770 for the income year immediately before the one in which the relevant time occurs. The amount is worked out using the formula:

##### 80245  Previous declarations of conduit foreign income

    * The entity's **_conduit foreign income _**is reduced if:

     * (a) the entity makes a *frankable distribution that has an *unfranked part; and

     * (b) the entity declares an amount of the unfranked part to be conduit foreign income.

    * The amount of the reduction is the amount so declared.

         * Note: If the amount declared is less than the amount available for declaration, the difference is available for a later declaration.

##### 80250  Receipt of an unfranked distribution from another Australian corporate tax entity

    * (1) The entity's **_conduit foreign income _**is reduced if:

     * (a) the entity (the **_receiving entity_**) receives from another *Australian corporate tax entity a *frankable distribution that has an *unfranked part; and

     * (b) the *distribution statement for the *distribution declares an amount (the **_declared amount_**) of the unfranked part to be conduit foreign income; and

     * (c) some or all of the declared amount is not *nonassessable nonexempt income under section 80220.

    * (2) The amount of the reduction is the amount that is not *nonassessable nonexempt income under section 80220 less any expenses reasonably related to that amount.

##### 80255  No double benefits

    * An amount cannot be both: 

     * (a) an unfranked nonportfolio dividend credit for an entity under section 46FB of the _Income Tax Assessment Act 1936_; and

     * (b) counted towards:

       * (i) the entity's *conduit foreign income; and

       * (ii) the entity's *nonassessable nonexempt income under section 80220.

##### 80260  No streaming of distributions

    * (1) Subsection (2) has effect if:

     * (a) an *Australian corporate tax entity makes one or more *frankable distributions in a *franking period; and

     * (b) at least one of the *distributions has an *unfranked part; and

     * (c) the entity declares an amount of the unfranked part to be *conduit foreign income.

    * (2) If the entity does not, for that *franking period, declare the same proportion of *conduit foreign income for all *membership interests and *nonshare equity interests then, instead of the amount that it declared to be conduit foreign income on those *distributions, it is taken to have declared under section 80245 the greater amount that it would have declared had it declared that same proportion on all those distributions.

         * Note: Breaching subsection (2) may make the entity subject to a penalty under section 28880 in Schedule 1 to the _Taxation Administration Act 1953_ (about over declaring conduit foreign income).

         * Example: There are 10,000 membership interests in AusCo Limited, 7,500 held by foreign residents and 2,500 held by Australian residents. It has $1,800 of conduit foreign income.

         * AusCo makes an unfranked distribution of 50 cents per membership interest to all of its members. It declares $1,500 of the distribution to be conduit foreign income for its 7,500 foreign membership interests (20 cents per membership interest or 40% of each distribution) and none for its Australian membership interests.

         * AusCo is taken to have declared the same proportion (40% of each distribution) of conduit foreign income for its Australian membership interests (which amounts to $500 of conduit foreign income). It is therefore taken to have declared $2,000 of conduit foreign income. This is an overdeclaration of $200 and a penalty under section 28880 in Schedule 1 to the _Taxation Administration Act 1953_ will apply.

    * (3) For the purposes of subsection (2), ignore *membership interests and *nonshare equity interests that do not carry a right to receive *distributions (other than distributions on winding up).

    * (4) Despite subsection (2), an entity that receives a *frankable distribution that has an *unfranked part is entitled to rely on the *distribution statement made by the entity that made the distribution.

##### Operative provisions

##### 8155  Object

    * The object of this Subdivision is to ensure the following amounts are appropriately brought to tax in Australia, consistent with the arm's length principle:

     * (a) profits which would have accrued to an Australian entity if it had been dealing at *arm's length, but, by reason of nonarm's length conditions operating between the entity and its foreign associated entities, have not so accrued;

     * (b) profits which an Australian permanent establishment (within the meaning of the relevant *international tax agreement) of a foreign entity might have been expected to make if it were a distinct and separate entity engaged in the same or similar activities under the same or similar conditions, but dealing wholly independently.

##### 81510  Transfer pricing benefit may be negated

    * (1) The Commissioner may make a determination mentioned in subsection 81530(1), in writing, for the purpose of negating a *transfer pricing benefit an entity gets.

    * Treaty requirement

    * (2) However, this section only applies to an entity if:

     * (a) the entity gets the *transfer pricing benefit under subsection 81515(1) at a time when an *international tax agreement containing an *associated enterprises article applies to the entity; or

     * (b) the entity gets the transfer pricing benefit under subsection 81515(2) at a time when an international tax agreement containing a *business profits article applies to the entity.

         * Note: This Subdivision does not apply to income years to which Subdivisions 815B and 815C apply: see section 8151 of the _Income Tax (Transitional Provisions) Act 1997_.

##### 81515  When an entity gets a transfer pricing benefit

    * Transfer pricing benefit--associated enterprises

    * (1) An entity gets a **_transfer pricing benefit_** if:

     * (a) the entity is an Australian resident; and

     * (b) the requirements in the *associated enterprises article for the application of that article to the entity are met; and

     * (c) an amount of profits which, but for the conditions mentioned in the article, might have been expected to accrue to the entity, has, by reason of those conditions, not so accrued; and

     * (d) had that amount of profits so accrued to the entity:

       * (i) the amount of the taxable income of the entity for an income year would be _greater_ than its actual amount; or

       * (ii) the amount of a tax loss of the entity for an income year would be _less_ than its actual amount; or

       * (iii) the amount of a *net capital loss of the entity for an income year would be _less_ than its actual amount.

    * The amount of the **_transfer pricing benefit_** is the difference between the amounts mentioned in subparagraph (d)(i), (ii) or (iii) (as the case requires).

    * Transfer pricing benefit--business profits

    * (2) A foreign resident entity gets a **_transfer pricing benefit_** if:

     * (a) the entity has a permanent establishment (within the meaning of the *international tax agreement) in Australia; and

     * (b) the amount of profits attributed to the permanent establishment falls short of the amount of profits the permanent establishment might be expected to make if it were a distinct and separate entity engaged, and dealing, in the manner mentioned in the *business profits article; and

     * (c) had the profits attributed to the permanent establishment included that shortfall:

       * (i) the amount of the taxable income of the entity for an income year would be _greater_ than its actual amount; or

       * (ii) the amount of a tax loss of the entity for an income year would be _less_ than its actual amount; or

       * (iii) the amount of a *net capital loss of the entity for an income year would be _less_ than its actual amount.

    * The amount of the **_transfer pricing benefit_** is the difference between the amounts mentioned in subparagraph (c)(i), (ii) or (iii) (as the case requires).

    * Nil amounts

    * (3) For the purposes of working out whether an entity gets a *transfer pricing benefit, and of negating that benefit under subsection 81530(1):

     * (a) treat an entity that has no taxable income for an income year as having a taxable income for the year of a nil amount; and

     * (b) treat an entity that has no tax loss for an income year as having a tax loss for the year of a nil amount; and

     * (c) treat an entity that has no *net capital loss for an income year as having a net capital loss for the year of a nil amount.

    * Multiple transfer pricing benefits

    * (4) To avoid doubt, an entity may get 2 or more *transfer pricing benefits, in one or more income years, in relation to one amount of profits, or one shortfall of profits.

    * Meaning of **associated enterprises article**

    * **	(5)	An **_associated enterprises article_** is:

     * (a) Article 9 of the United Kingdom convention (within the meaning of the _International Tax Agreements Act 1953_); or

     * (b) a corresponding provision of another *international tax agreement.

    * Meaning of **business profits article**

    * **	(6)	A **_business profits article_** is:

     * (a) Article 7 of the United Kingdom convention (within the meaning of the _International Tax Agreements Act 1953_); or

     * (b) a corresponding provision of another *international tax agreement.

##### 81520  Crossborder transfer pricing guidance

    * (1) For the purpose of determining the effect this Subdivision has in relation to an entity:

     * (a) work out whether an entity gets a *transfer pricing benefit consistently with the documents covered by this section, to the extent the documents are relevant; and

     * (b) interpret a provision of an *international tax agreement consistently with those documents, to the extent they are relevant.

    * (2) The documents covered by this section are as follows:

     * (a) the Model Tax Convention on Income and on Capital, and its Commentaries, as adopted by the Council of the Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development and last amended on 22 July 2010;

     * (b) the Transfer Pricing Guidelines for Multinational Enterprises and Tax Administrations, as approved by that Council and last amended on 22 July 2010;

     * (c) a document, or part of a document, prescribed by the regulations for the purposes of this paragraph.

    * (3) However, a document, or a part of a document, mentioned in paragraph (2)(a) or (b) is not covered by this section if the regulations so prescribe.

    * (4) Regulations made for the purposes of paragraph (2)(c) or subsection (3) may prescribe different documents or parts of documents for different circumstances.

##### 81525  Modified transfer pricing benefit for thin capitalisation

    * (1) This section modifies the *transfer pricing benefit an entity gets, or apart from this section would get, in an income year if:

     * (a) Division 820 (about thin capitalisation) applies to the entity for the income year; and

     * (b) the transfer pricing benefit relates to profits, or a shortfall of profits, referable to costs that are *debt deductions of the entity for the income year.

    * (2) If working out what those costs might have been, or might be expected to be, involves applying a rate to a *debt interest:

     * (a) work out the rate by applying section 81515, having regard to section 81520; but

     * (b) apply the rate to the debt interest the entity actually issued.

         * Note: Division 820 may apply to further reduce debt deductions.

##### 81530  Determinations negating transfer pricing benefit

    * (1) The determinations the Commissioner may make are as follows:

     * (a) a determination of an amount by which the taxable income of the entity for an income year is increased;

     * (b) a determination of an amount by which the tax loss of the entity for an income year is decreased;

     * (c) a determination of an amount by which the *net capital loss of the entity for an income year is decreased.

    * (2) If the Commissioner makes a determination under subsection (1), the determination is taken to be attributable, to the relevant extent, to such of the following as the Commissioner may determine:

     * (a) an increase of a particular amount in assessable income of the entity for an income year under a particular provision of this Act;

     * (b) a decrease of a particular amount in particular deductions of the entity for an income year;

     * (c) an increase of a particular amount in particular capital gains of the entity for an income year;

     * (d) a decrease of a particular amount in particular capital losses of the entity for an income year.

    * (3) If the Commissioner makes a determination under subsection (1), the Commissioner must make a determination under subsection (2), unless it is not possible or practicable for the Commissioner to do so.

         * Example: If section 81525 is relevant in working out the transfer pricing benefit an entity gets, this subsection requires the Commissioner to make a determination relating to the debt deductions of the entity.

    * (4) Nothing done under subsection (2) affects the validity of a determination made under subsection (1).

    * (5) The Commissioner may take such action as the Commissioner considers necessary to give effect to a determination under this section.

    * (6) The Commissioner must give a copy of a determination under this section to the entity.

    * (7) A failure to comply with subsection (6) does not affect the validity of the determination.

    * (8) To avoid doubt, the Commissioner may include all or any determinations under this section in relation to a particular entity, including determinations of different kinds, in the same document.

##### 81535  Consequential adjustments

    * Consequential adjustment--associated enterprises

    * (1) The Commissioner may make a determination under subsection (4) in relation to an entity (the **_disadvantaged entity_**) if:

     * (a) the Commissioner makes a determination under subsection 81530(1) in relation to a *transfer pricing benefit an entity gets under subsection 81515(1); and

     * (b) the Commissioner considers that, but for the conditions mentioned in the *associated enterprises article:

       * (i) the amount of the taxable income of the disadvantaged entity for an income year might have been expected to be _less_ than its actual amount; or

       * (ii) the amount of a *tax loss of the disadvantaged entity for an income year might have been expected to be _greater_ than its actual amount; or

       * (iii) the amount of a *net capital loss of the disadvantaged entity for an income year might have been expected to be _greater_ than its actual amount; or

       * (iv) an amount of *withholding tax payable in respect of interest or royalties by the disadvantaged entity might have been expected to be _less_ than its actual amount; and

     * (c) the Commissioner considers that it is fair and reasonable that the actual amount mentioned in subparagraph (b)(i), (ii), (iii) or (iv) (as the case requires) be adjusted accordingly.

    * Consequential adjustment--business profits

    * (2) The Commissioner may make a determination under subsection (4) in relation to an entity (the **_disadvantaged entity_**) if:

     * (a) the Commissioner makes a determination under subsection 81530(1) in relation to a *transfer pricing benefit an entity gets under subsection 81515(2); and

     * (b) the Commissioner considers that, if the permanent establishment were a distinct and separate entity engaged, and dealing, in the manner mentioned in the *business profits article:

       * (i) the amount of the taxable income of the disadvantaged entity for an income year might have been expected to be _less_ than its actual amount; or

       * (ii) the amount of a *tax loss of the disadvantaged entity for an income year might have been expected to be _greater_ than its actual amount; or

       * (iii) the amount of a *net capital loss of the disadvantaged entity for an income year might have been expected to be _greater_ than its actual amount; or

       * (iv) an amount of *withholding tax payable in respect of interest or royalties by the disadvantaged entity might have been expected to be _less_ than its actual amount; and

     * (c) the Commissioner considers that it is fair and reasonable that the actual amount mentioned in subparagraph (b)(i), (ii), (iii) or (iv) (as the case requires) be adjusted accordingly.

    * Nil amounts

    * (3) For the purposes of this section:

     * (a) treat an entity that has no taxable income for an income year as having a taxable income for the year of a nil amount; and

     * (b) treat an entity that has no tax loss for an income year as having a tax loss for the year of a nil amount; and

     * (c) treat an entity that has no *net capital loss for an income year as having a net capital loss for the year of a nil amount.

    * (4) The Commissioner may make one or more of the following determinations, in writing, for the purpose of adjusting an amount as mentioned in paragraph (1)(c) or (2)(c):

     * (a) a determination of an amount by which the taxable income of the disadvantaged entity for an income year is decreased;

     * (b) a determination of an amount by which the tax loss of the disadvantaged entity for an income year is increased;

     * (c) a determination of an amount by which the *net capital loss of the disadvantaged entity for an income year is increased;

     * (d) a determination of an amount by which the *withholding tax payable by the disadvantaged entity in respect of interest or royalties is decreased.

    * (5) The Commissioner may take such action as the Commissioner considers necessary to give effect to a determination under this section.

    * (6) The Commissioner must give a copy of a determination under this section to the disadvantaged entity.

    * (7) A failure to comply with subsection (6) does not affect the validity of the determination.

    * (8) To avoid doubt, the Commissioner may include all or any determinations under this section in relation to a particular entity, including determinations of different kinds, in the same document.

    * (9) An entity may give the Commissioner a written request to make a determination under this section relating to the entity. The Commissioner must decide whether or not to grant the request, and give the entity notice of the Commissioner's decision.

      * 815150	Amendment of assessments

##### Operative provisions

##### 815105  Object

    * (1) The object of this Subdivision is to ensure that the amount brought to tax in Australia from crossborder conditions between entities is not less than it would be if those conditions reflected:

     * (a) the arm's length contribution made by Australian operations through functions performed, assets used and risks assumed; and

     * (b) the conditions that might be expected to operate between entities dealing at *arm's length.

    * (2) The Subdivision does this by specifying that, where an entity would otherwise get a tax advantage from actual conditions that differ from *arm's length conditions, the arm's length conditions are taken to operate for income tax and withholding tax purposes.

##### 815110  Operation of Subdivision

    * (1) Nothing in the provisions of this Act other than this Subdivision limits the operation of this Subdivision.

    * (2) Nothing in this Subdivision limits Division 820 (about thin capitalisation) in its application to reduce, or further reduce, *debt deductions of an entity.

##### 815115  Substitution of arm's length conditions

    * (1) For the purposes covered by subsection (2), if an entity gets a *transfer pricing benefit from conditions that operate between the entity and another entity in connection with their commercial or financial relations:

     * (a) those conditions are taken not to operate; and

     * (b) instead, the *arm's length conditions are taken to operate.

         * Note 1: The conditions that operate include, but are not limited to, such things as price, gross margin, net profit, and the division of profit between the entities.

         * Note 2: There are special rules about documentation that affect when an entity has a reasonably arguable position about the application (or nonapplication) of this Subdivision: see Subdivision 284E in Schedule 1 to the _Taxation Administration Act 1953_.

    * (2) The purposes covered by this subsection are:

     * (a) if the *transfer pricing benefit arises under subparagraph 815120(1)(c)(i)--working out the amount (if any) of the entity's taxable income for the income year; and

     * (b) if the transfer pricing benefit arises under subparagraph 815120(1)(c)(ii)--working out the amount (if any) of the entity's loss of a particular *sort for the income year; and

     * (c) if the transfer pricing benefit arises under subparagraph 815120(1)(c)(iii)--working out the amount (if any) of the entity's *tax offsets for the income year; and

     * (d) if the transfer pricing benefit arises under subparagraph 815120(1)(c)(iv)--working out the amount (if any) of *withholding tax payable by the entity in respect of interest or royalties.

##### 815120  When an entity gets a transfer pricing benefit

    * (1) An entity gets a **_transfer pricing benefit_** from conditions that operate between the entity and another entity in connection with their commercial or financial relations if:

     * (a) those conditions (the **_actual conditions_**) differ from the *arm's length conditions; and

     * (b) the actual conditions satisfy the crossborder test in subsection (3) for the entity; and

     * (c) had the arm's length conditions operated, instead of the actual conditions, one or more of the following would, apart from this Subdivision, apply:

       * (i) the amount of the entity's taxable income for an income year would be _greater_;

       * (ii) the amount of the entity's loss of a particular *sort for an income year would be _less_;

       * (iii) the amount of the entity's *tax offsets for an income year would be _less_;

       * (iv) an amount of *withholding tax payable in respect of interest or royalties by the entity would be _greater_.

    * Absence of condition

    * (2) For the purposes of subsection (1), there is taken to be a difference between the actual conditions and the *arm's length conditions if:

     * (a) an actual condition exists that is not one of the arm's length conditions; or

     * (b) a condition does not exist in the actual conditions but is one of the arm's length conditions.

    * Crossborder test

    * (3) Conditions that operate between an entity and another entity in connection with their commercial or financial relations satisfy the crossborder test if:

     * (a) the conditions meet the overseas requirement in the following table for either or both of the entities; or

     * (b) the conditions operate in connection with a *business that the entity carries on in an *area covered by an international tax sharing treaty.

    * (4) For the purposes of the table in subsection (3), treat any entity that is an Australian resident as not being an Australian resident if:

     * (a) the entity is also a resident in a country that has entered into an *international tax agreement with Australia containing a *residence article; and

     * (b) under that residence article, the entity is taken, for the purposes of the agreement, to be a resident only of that other country.

    * Nil amounts

    * (5) For the purposes of this section and section 815145:

     * (a) treat an entity that has no taxable income for an income year as having a taxable income for the year of a nil amount; and

     * (b) treat an entity that has no loss of a particular *sort for an income year as having a loss of that sort for the year of a nil amount; and

     * (c) treat an entity that has no *tax offsets for an income year as having tax offsets for the year of a nil amount.

    * Meaning of **residence article**

    * **	(6)	A **_residence article_** is:

     * (a) Article 4 of the United Kingdom convention (within the meaning of the _International Tax Agreements Act 1953_); or

     * (b) a corresponding provision of another *international tax agreement.

##### 815125  Meaning of arm's length conditions

    * (1) The **_arm's length conditions_**, in relation to conditions that operate between an entity and another entity, are the conditions that might be expected to operate between independent entities dealing wholly independently with one another in comparable circumstances.

    * Most appropriate and reliable method to be used

    * (2) In identifying the *arm's length conditions, use the method, or the combination of methods, that is the most appropriate and reliable, having regard to all relevant factors, including the following:

     * (a) the respective strengths and weaknesses of the possible methods in their application to the actual conditions;

     * (b) the circumstances, including the functions performed, assets used and risks borne by the entities;

     * (c) the availability of reliable information required to apply a particular method;

     * (d) the degree of comparability between the actual circumstances and the comparable circumstances, including the reliability of any adjustments to eliminate the effect of material differences between those circumstances.

         * Note: The possible methods include the methods set out in the documents mentioned in section 815135 (about relevant guidance material).

    * Comparability of circumstances

    * (3) In identifying comparable circumstances for the purpose of this section, regard must be had to all relevant factors, including the following:

     * (a) the functions performed, assets used and risks borne by the entities;

     * (b) the characteristics of any property or services transferred;

     * (c) the terms of any relevant contracts between the entities;

     * (d) the economic circumstances;

     * (e) the business strategies of the entities.

    * (4) For the purposes of this section, circumstances are comparable to actual circumstances if, to the extent (if any) that the circumstances differ from the actual circumstances:

     * (a) the difference does not materially affect a condition that is relevant to the method; or

     * (b) a reasonably accurate adjustment can be made to eliminate the effect of the difference on a condition that is relevant to the method.

##### 815130  Relevance of actual commercial or financial relations

    * Basic rule

    * (1) The identification of the *arm's length conditions must:

     * (a) be based on the commercial or financial relations in connection with which the actual conditions operate; and

     * (b) have regard to both the form and substance of those relations.

    * Exceptions

    * (2) Despite paragraph (1)(b), disregard the form of the actual commercial or financial relations to the extent (if any) that it is inconsistent with the substance of those relations.

    * (3) Despite subsection (1), if:

     * (a) independent entities dealing wholly independently with one another in comparable circumstances would not have entered into the actual commercial or financial relations; and

     * (b) independent entities dealing wholly independently with one another in comparable circumstances would have entered into other commercial or financial relations; and

     * (c) those other commercial or financial relations differ in substance from the actual commercial or financial relations;

    * the identification of the *arm's length conditions must be based on those other commercial or financial relations.

    * (4) Despite subsection (1), if independent entities dealing wholly independently with one another in comparable circumstances would not have entered into commercial or financial relations, the identification of the *arm's length conditions is to be based on that absence of commercial or financial relations.

    * (5) Subsections 815125(3) and (4) (about comparability of circumstances) apply for the purposes of this section.

##### 815135  Guidance

    * (1) For the purpose of determining the effect this Subdivision has in relation to an entity, identify *arm's length conditions so as best to achieve consistency with the documents covered by this section.

    * (2) The documents covered by this section are as follows:

     * (a) the Transfer Pricing Guidelines for Multinational Enterprises and Tax Administrations, as approved by the Council of the Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development and last amended on 22 July 2010;

     * (b) a document, or part of a document, prescribed by the regulations for the purposes of this paragraph.

    * (3) However, the document mentioned in paragraph (2)(a) is not covered by this section if the regulations so prescribe.

    * (4) Regulations made for the purposes of paragraph (2)(b) or subsection (3) may prescribe different documents or parts of documents for different circumstances.

##### 815140  Modification for thin capitalisation

    * (1) This section modifies the way an entity to which section 815115 applies works out its taxable income, or its loss of a particular *sort, for an income year, if:

     * (a) Division 820 (about thin capitalisation) applies to the entity for the income year; and

     * (b) the *arm's length conditions affect costs that are *debt deductions of the entity for the income year.

    * (2) If working out what those costs would be if the *arm's length conditions had operated involves applying a rate to a *debt interest:

     * (a) work out the rate as if the arm's length conditions had operated; but

     * (b) apply the rate to the debt interest the entity actually issued.

         * Note: Division 820 may apply to reduce or further reduce debt deductions.

##### 815145  Consequential adjustments

    * (1) The Commissioner may make a determination under subsection (2) in relation to an entity (the **_disadvantaged entity_**) if:

     * (a) *arm's length conditions are taken by section 815115 to operate; and

     * (b) the Commissioner considers that, if the arm's length conditions, instead of the actual conditions, had operated:

       * (i) the amount of the disadvantaged entity's taxable income for an income year might have been expected to be _less_ than its actual amount; or

       * (ii) the amount of the disadvantaged entity's loss of a particular *sort for an income year might have been expected to be _greater_ than its actual amount; or

       * (iii) the amount of the disadvantaged entity's *tax offsets for an income year might have been expected to be _greater_ than their actual amount; or

       * (iv) an amount of *withholding tax payable in respect of interest or royalties by the disadvantaged entity might have been expected to be _less_ than its actual amount; and

     * (c) the Commissioner considers that it is fair and reasonable that the actual amount mentioned in subparagraph (b)(i), (ii), (iii) or (iv) (as the case requires) be adjusted accordingly.

    * (2) For the purpose of adjusting an amount as mentioned in paragraph (1)(c), the Commissioner may make a determination stating the amount that is (and has been at all times) the amount of the disadvantaged entity's:

     * (a) taxable income for the income year; or

     * (b) loss of a particular *sort for the income year; or

     * (c) *tax offsets, or tax offset of a particular kind, for the income year; or

     * (d) *withholding tax payable in respect of interest or royalties.

    * (3) The Commissioner may take such action as the Commissioner considers necessary to give effect to a determination under this section.

    * (4) The Commissioner must give a copy of a determination under this section to the disadvantaged entity.

    * (5) A failure to comply with subsection (4) does not affect the validity of the determination.

    * (6) To avoid doubt, the Commissioner may include all or any determinations under this section in relation to a particular entity, including determinations of different kinds, in the same document.

    * (7) An entity may give the Commissioner a written request to make a determination under this section relating to the entity. The Commissioner must decide whether or not to grant the request, and give the entity notice of the Commissioner's decision.

    * (8) If the entity is dissatisfied with the Commissioner's decision, the entity may object, in the manner set out in Part IVC of the _Taxation Administration Act 1953_, against that decision.

##### 815150  Amendment of assessments

    * (1) Section 170 of the _Income Tax Assessment Act 1936_ does not prevent the amendment of an assessment of an entity for an income year if:

     * (a) the amendment is made within 7 years after the day on which the Commissioner gives notice of the assessment to the entity; and

     * (b) the amendment is made for the purpose of giving effect to section 815115.

    * (2) Section 170 of the _Income Tax Assessment Act 1936_ does not prevent the amendment of an assessment at any time for the purpose of giving effect to section 815145.

      * 815240	Amendment of assessments

##### Operative provisions

##### 815205  Object

    * The object of this Subdivision is to ensure that the amount brought to tax in Australia by entities operating *permanent establishments is not less than it would be if the permanent establishment were a distinct and separate entity engaged in the same or comparable activities under the same or comparable circumstances, but dealing wholly independently with the other part of the entity.

##### 815210  Operation of Subdivision

    * (1) Nothing in the provisions of this Act other than this Subdivision limits the operation of this Subdivision.

    * (2) Nothing in this Subdivision limits Division 820 (about thin capitalisation) in its application to reduce, or further reduce, *debt deductions of an entity.

    * (3) For the purposes of this Subdivision, a branch to which subsection 160ZZW(2) of the _Income Tax Assessment Act 1936_ (about certain Australian branches of foreign banks) applies is taken not to be, and not to have been at any time since its establishment, a *permanent establishment in Australia of the bank.

##### 815215  Substitution of arm's length profits

    * (1) For the purposes covered by subsection (2), if an entity gets a *transfer pricing benefit from the attribution of profits to a *PE of the entity:

     * (a) the amount of profits actually attributed to the PE is taken not to have been so attributed; and

     * (b) instead, the *arm's length profits are taken to have been attributed to the PE.

         * Note: There are special rules about documentation that affect when an entity has a reasonably arguable position about the application (or nonapplication) of this Subdivision: see Subdivision 284E in Schedule 1 to the _Taxation Administration Act 1953_.

    * (2) The purposes covered by this subsection are:

     * (a) if the *transfer pricing benefit arises under subparagraph 815220(1)(b)(i)--working out the amount (if any) of the entity's taxable income for the income year; and

     * (b) if the transfer pricing benefit arises under subparagraph 815220(1)(b)(ii)--working out the amount (if any) of a loss of a particular *sort for the income year; and

     * (c) if the transfer pricing benefit arises under subparagraph 815220(1)(b)(iii)--working out the amount (if any) of the entity's *tax offsets for the income year.

##### 815220  When an entity gets a transfer pricing benefit

    * (1) An entity gets a **_transfer pricing benefit_** from the attribution of profits to a *PE of the entity if:

     * (a) the amount of profits (the **_actual profits_**) attributed to the PE differs from the *arm's length profits for the PE; and

     * (b) had the arm's length profits, instead of the actual profits, been attributed to the PE, one or more of the following would, apart from this Subdivision, apply:

       * (i) the amount of the entity's taxable income for an income year would be _greater_;

       * (ii) the amount of the entity's loss of a particular *sort for an income year would be _less_;

       * (iii) the amount of the entity's *tax offsets for an income year would be _less_.

    * Nil amounts

    * (2) For the purposes of this section:

     * (a) treat an entity that has no taxable income for an income year as having a taxable income for the year of a nil amount; and

     * (b) treat an entity that has no loss of a particular *sort for an income year as having a loss of that sort for the year of a nil amount; and

     * (c) treat an entity that has no *tax offsets for an income year as having tax offsets for the year of a nil amount.

##### 815225  Meaning of arm's length profits

    * (1) The **_arm's length profits_** for a *PE of an entity are worked out by allocating the actual expenditure and income of the entity between the PE and the entity so that the profits attributed to the PE equal the profits the PE might be expected to make if:

     * (a) the PE were a distinct and separate entity; and

     * (b) the activities and circumstances of the PE, including the functions performed, assets used and risks borne by the PE, were those of that separate entity; and

     * (c) the conditions that operated between that separate entity and the entity of which it is a PE were the *arm's length conditions.

    * (2) The conditions to which the *arm's length conditions mentioned in paragraph (1)(c) relate are the conditions that would operate between the separate entity and the entity of which it is a *PE if the assumptions in paragraphs (1)(a) and (b) were made.

    * (3) For the purposes of subsection (1):

     * (a) the actual expenditure of an entity is taken to include losses and outgoings; and

     * (b) the actual income of an entity is taken to include any amount that is, or is to be, included in the entity's assessable income.

##### 815230  Source rules for certain arm's length profits

    * (1) The *arm's length profits for a *PE in Australia are taken, for the purposes of this Act, to be attributable to sources in Australia.

     * (a) the documents covered by this section; and

     * (b) subject to paragraph (a), the documents covered by section 815135.

    * (2) The documents covered by this section are as follows:

##### 82039  Exemption of certain special purpose entities

    * (1) Subdivision 820B, 820C, 820D or 820E does not apply to disallow any *debt deduction of an entity for an income year if the entity meets the conditions in subsection (3) throughout the income year.

    * (2) Subdivision 820B, 820C, 820D or 820E does not apply to disallow any *debt deduction of an entity for an income year that is an amount incurred by the entity during a part of that year, if the entity meets the conditions in subsection (3) throughout that part.

    * (3) The conditions are:

     * (a) the entity is one established for the purposes of managing some or all of the economic risk associated with assets, liabilities or investments (whether the entity assumes the risk from another entity or creates the risk itself); and

     * (b) the total value of *debt interests in the entity is at least 50% of the total value of the entity's assets; and

     * (c) the entity is an insolvencyremote special purpose entity according to criteria of an internationally recognised rating agency that are applicable to the entity's circumstances.

    * (4) The condition in paragraph (3)(c) can be met without the rating agency determining that the entity meets those criteria.

         * Note 1: While an entity meets the conditions in subsection (3), it is treated for the purposes of this Division as _not_ being a member of a consolidated group or MEC group (see section 820584).

         * Note 2: An entity that does not qualify for the exemption in this section may still be a securitisation vehicle under subsection 820942(2), in which case the value of its securitised assets will count towards its zerocapital amount under Subdivision 820K.

    * Multitier special purpose entities

    * (5) An entity is taken to meet the conditions in subsection (3) throughout a period that is all or part of an income year, if the entity is one of 2 or more entities that together satisfy the condition that, assuming:

     * (a) each of the entities had been a division or part of the same entity (the **_notional entity_**), rather than a separate entity, throughout that period; and

     * (b) the notional entity had consisted only of those divisions and parts throughout that period;

    * the notional entity would meet the conditions in subsection (3) throughout that period.

##### 82040  Meaning of debt deduction

    * (1) **_Debt deduction_**, of an entity and for an income year, is a cost incurred by the entity in relation to a *debt interest issued by the entity, to the extent to which:

     * (a) the cost is:

       * (i) interest, an amount in the nature of interest, or any other amount that is calculated by reference to the time value of money; or

       * (ii) the difference between the *financial benefits received, or to be received, by the entity under the *scheme giving rise to the debt interest and the financial benefits provided, or to be provided, under that scheme; or

       * (iii) any amount directly incurred in obtaining or maintaining the financial benefits received, or to be received, by the entity under the scheme giving rise to the debt interest; or

       * (iv) any other expense incurred by the entity that is specified in the regulations made for the purposes of this subparagraph; and

     * (b) the entity can, apart from this Division, deduct the cost from its assessable income for that year;

    * (2) A cost covered by paragraph (1)(a) includes, but is not limited to, any of the following:

     * (a) an amount in substitution for interest;

     * (b) a discount in respect of a security;

     * (c) a fee or charge in respect of a debt, including application fees, line fees, service fees, brokerage and stamp duty in respect of document registration or security for the debt interest;

     * (d) an amount that is taken under an *income tax law to be an amount of interest in respect of a lease, a hire purchase arrangement or any other *arrangement specified in that law;

     * (e) any loss in respect of:

       * (i) a reciprocal purchase agreement (otherwise known as a repurchase agreement);

       * (ii) a sellbuyback arrangement;

       * (iii) a securities loan arrangement;

     * (f) any amount covered by paragraph (1)(a) that has been assigned or is dealt with in any way on behalf of the party who would otherwise be entitled to that amount.

    * (3) To avoid doubt, the following amounts that are incurred by an entity in relation to a *debt interest issued by the entity are not covered by paragraph (1)(a):

     * (a) losses and outgoings directly associated with hedging or managing the financial risk in respect of the debt interest;

     * (b) losses incurred by the entity in relation to which the following apply:

       * (i) the losses would otherwise be a cost covered by subparagraph (1)(a)(ii); but

       * (ii) the benefits mentioned in that subparagraph are measured in a foreign currency or a unit of account other than Australian currency (for example, ounces of gold) and the losses have arisen only because of changes in the rate of converting that foreign currency or that unit of account into Australian currency;

     * (c) salary or wages;

     * (d) rental expenses for a lease if the lease is not a debt interest;

##### Operative provisions

##### 82085  Thin capitalisation rule for outward investing entities (nonADI)

    * Thin capitalisation rule

    * (1) This subsection disallows all or a part of each *debt deduction of an entity for an income year (to the extent that it is not attributable to an *overseas permanent establishment of the entity) if, for that year:

     * (a) the entity is an *outward investing entity (nonADI) (see subsection (2)); and

     * (b) the entity's *adjusted average debt (see subsection (3)) exceeds its *maximum allowable debt (see section 82090).

         * Note 1: This Subdivision does not apply if the total debt deductions of that entity and all its associate entities for that year are $2 million or less, see section 82035.

         * Note 2: To work out the amount to be disallowed, see section 820115.

         * Note 3: For the rules that apply to an entity that is an outward investing entity (nonADI) for only a part of an income year, see section 820120 in conjunction with subsection (2) of this section.

         * Note 4: A consolidated group or MEC group may be an outward investing entity (nonADI) to which this Subdivision applies: see Subdivisions 820FA and 820FB.

    * Outward investing entity (nonADI)

    * (2) The entity is an **_outward investing entity (nonADI) _**for a period that is all or a part of an income year if, and only if, it is:

     * (a) an *outward investor (general) for that period (as set out in items 1 and 3 of the following table); or

     * (b) an *outward investor (financial) for that period (as set out in items 2 and 4 of that table).

         * Note 1: To determine whether an entity is an Australian controller of an Australian controlled foreign entity, see Subdivision 820H.

         * Note 2: The rules that apply to an outward investor (general) are different from those that apply to an outward investor (financial) in some instances. For example, see sections 82095 and 820100.

    * Adjusted average debt

    * (3) The entity's **_adjusted average debt_** for an income year is the result of applying the method statement in this subsection. In applying the method statement, disregard any amount that is attributable to the entity's *overseas permanent establishments.

Method statement

       * Step 1.	Work out the average value, for that year (the **_relevant year_**), of all the *debt capital of the entity that gives rise to *debt deductions of the entity for that or any other income year.

       * Step 2.	Reduce the result of step 1 by the average value, for the relevant year, of all the *associate entity debt of the entity.

       * Step 3.	Reduce the result of step 2 by the average value, for the relevant year, of all the *controlled foreign entity debt of the entity.

       * Step 4.	If the entity is a *financial entity throughout the relevant year, add to the result of step 3 the average value, for the relevant year, of the entity's *borrowed securities amount.

       * Step 5.	Add to the result of step 4 the average value, for the relevant year, of the *costfree debt capital of the entity. The result of this step is the **_adjusted average debt_**.

         * Note: To calculate an average value for the purposes of this Division, see Subdivision 820G.

    * (4) The entity's *adjusted average debt does not exceed its *maximum allowable debt if the adjusted average debt is nil or a negative amount.

##### 82090  Maximum allowable debt

    * Entity is not also an inward investment vehicle (general) or inward investment vehicle (financial)

    * (1) The entity's **_maximum allowable debt_** for an income year is the greatest of the following amounts if the entity is not also an *inward investment vehicle (general) or an *inward investment vehicle (financial) for all or any part of that year:

     * (a) the *safe harbour debt amount;

     * (b) the *arm's length debt amount;

     * (c) unless the entity has *worldwide equity of nil or a negative amount--the *worldwide gearing debt amount.

         * Note 1: The safe harbour debt amount differs depending on whether the entity is an outward investor (general) or an outward investor (financial), see sections 82095 and 820100.

         * Note 2: The worldwide gearing debt amount for an entity that is not also an inward investment vehicle (general) or an inward investment vehicle (financial) differs depending on whether the entity is an outward investor (general) or an outward investor (financial), see section 820110.

    * Entity is also an inward investment vehicle (general) or inward investment vehicle (financial)

    * (2) The entity's **_maximum allowable debt_** for an income year is the greatest of the following amounts if the entity is also an *inward investment vehicle (general) or an *inward investment vehicle (financial) for all or any part of that year:

     * (a) the *safe harbour debt amount;

     * (b) the *arm's length debt amount;

     * (c) unless subsection (3) applies to the entity--the *worldwide gearing debt amount.

         * Note 1: The safe harbour debt amount differs depending on whether the entity is an outward investor (general) or an outward investor (financial), see sections 82095 and 820100.

         * Note 2: The worldwide gearing debt amount for an entity that is also an inward investment vehicle (general) or an inward investment vehicle (financial) differs depending on whether the entity is an outward investor (general) or an outward investor (financial), see section 820111.

    * Inward investment vehicles that are not eligible for the worldwide gearing debt amount

    * (3) This subsection applies to an entity, if:

     * (a) the entity has *statement worldwide equity, or *statement worldwide assets, of nil or a negative amount; or

     * (b) *audited consolidated financial statements for the entity for the income year do not exist; or

     * (c) the result of applying the following formula is greater than 0.5:

    * where: 

    * **_average Australian assets _**of an entity is the average value, for the statement period mentioned in subsection (4), of all the assets of the entity, other than:

     * (a) any assets attributable to the entity's *overseas permanent establishments; or

     * (b) any *debt interests held by the entity, to the extent to which any value of the interests is all or a part of the *controlled foreign entity debt of the entity; or

     * (c) any *equity interests or debt interests held by the entity, to the extent to which any value of the interests is all or a part of the *controlled foreign entity equity of the entity.

    * (4) For the purposes of the definition of **_average Australian assets_** in subsection (3) the statement period is the period for which the *audited consolidated financial statements for the entity for the income year have been prepared.

    * (5) For the purposes of the formula in paragraph (3)(c), if:

     * (a) an amount is included in *statement worldwide assets in respect of an asset; and

     * (b) the asset was acquired, held or otherwise dealt with by an entity for a purpose (other than an incidental purpose) that included ensuring that subsection (3) does not apply to an entity; and

     * (c) as a result of the acquisition, holding or dealing with of the asset, the amount included in statement worldwide assets exceeds the amount (including nil) that would otherwise be so included;

    * apply the amount of the excess to reduce statement worldwide assets (or statement worldwide assets as reduced by a previous application of this subsection).

##### 82095  Safe harbour debt amount--outward investor (general)

    * If the entity is an *outward investor (general) for the income year, the **_safe harbour debt amount_** is the result of applying the method statement in this section. In applying the method statement, disregard any amount that is attributable to the entity's *overseas permanent establishments.

Method statement

       * Step 1.	Work out the average value, for the income year, of all the assets of the entity.

       * Step 1A.	Reduce the result of step 1 by the average value, for that year, of all the *excluded equity interests in the entity.

       * Step 2.	Reduce the result of step 1A by the average value, for that year, of all the *associate entity debt of the entity.

       * Step 3.	Reduce the result of step 2 by the average value, for that year, of all the *associate entity equity of the entity.

       * Step 4.	Reduce the result of step 3 by the average value, for that year, of all the *controlled foreign entity debt of the entity.

       * Step 5.	Reduce the result of step 4 by the average value, for that year, of all the *controlled foreign entity equity of the entity.

       * Step 6.	Reduce the result of step 5 by the average value, for that year, of all the *nondebt liabilities of the entity. If the result of this step is a negative amount, it is taken to be nil.

       * Step 7.	Multiply the result of step 6 by 3/5.

       * Step 8.	Add to the result of step 7 the average value, for that year, of the entity's *associate entity excess amount. The result of this step is the **_safe harbour debt amount_**.

         * Example: AK Pty Ltd, a company that is an Australian entity, has an average value of assets (other than assets attributable to its overseas permanent establishments) of $100 million.

         * The average values of its excluded equity interests, associate entity debt, associate entity equity, controlled foreign entity debt, controlled foreign entity equity and nondebt liabilities are $5 million, $10 million, $8 million, $5 million, $2 million and $5 million respectively. Deducting these amounts from the result of step 1 (through applying steps 1A to 6) leaves $65 million. Multiplying $65 million by 3/5 results in $39 million. As the average value of the company's associate entity excess amount is $4.5 million, the safe harbour debt amount is therefore $43.5 million.

##### 820100  Safe harbour debt amount--outward investor (financial)

    * (1) If the entity is an *outward investor (financial) for the income year, the **_safe harbour debt amount_** is the lesser of the following amounts:

     * (a) the *total debt amount (worked out under subsection (2));

     * (b) the *adjusted onlent amount (worked out under subsection (3)).

    * However, if the 2 amounts are equal, it is the total debt amount.

    * Total debt amount

    * (2) The **_total debt amount_** is the result of applying the method statement in this subsection. In applying the method statement, disregard any amount that is attributable to the entity's *overseas permanent establishments.

Method statement

       * Step 1.	Work out the average value, for the income year, of all the assets of the entity.

       * Step 1A.	Reduce the result of step 1 by the average value, for that year, of all the *excluded equity interests in the entity.

       * Step 2.	Reduce the result of step 1A by the average value, for that year, of all the *associate entity debt of the entity.

       * Step 3.	Reduce the result of step 2 by the average value, for that year, of all the *associate entity equity of the entity.

       * Step 4.	Reduce the result of step 3 by the average value, for that year, of all the *controlled foreign entity debt of the entity.

       * Step 5.	Reduce the result of step 4 by the average value, for that year, of all the *controlled foreign entity equity of the entity.

       * Step 6.	Reduce the result of step 5 by the average value, for that year, of all the *nondebt liabilities of the entity.

       * Step 7.	Reduce the result of step 6 by the average value, for that year, of the entity's *zerocapital amount. If the result of this step is a negative amount, it is taken to be nil.

       * Step 8.	Multiply the result of step 7 by 15/16.

       * Step 9.	Add to the result of step 8 the average value, for that year, of the entity's *zerocapital amount.

       * Step 10.	Add to the result of step 9 the average value, for that year, of the entity's *associate entity excess amount. The result of this step is the **_total debt amount_**.

         * Example: GLM Limited, a company that is an Australian entity, has an average value of assets (other than assets attributable to its overseas permanent establishments) of $160 million.

         * The average values of its relevant excluded equity interests, associate entity debt, associate entity equity, controlled foreign entity debt, controlled foreign entity equity, nondebt liabilities and zerocapital amount are $5 million, $5 million, $5 million, $9 million, $6 million, $5 million and $4 million respectively. Deducting these amounts from the result of step 1 (through applying steps 1A to 7) leaves $121 million. Multiplying $121 million by 15/16 results in $113.4375 million. Adding the average zerocapital amount of $4 million results in $117.4375 million. As the company does not have any associate entity excess amount, the total debt amount is therefore $117.4375 million.

    * Adjusted onlent amount

    * (3) The **_adjusted onlent amount_** is the result of applying the method statement in this subsection. In applying the method statement, disregard any amount that is attributable to the entity's *overseas permanent establishments.

Method statement

       * Step 1.	Work out the average value, for the income year, of all the assets of the entity.

       * Step 1A.	Reduce the result of step 1 by the average value, for that year, of all the *excluded equity interests in the entity.

       * Step 2.	Reduce the result of step 1A by the average value, for that year, of all the *associate entity equity of the entity.

       * Step 3.	Reduce the result of step 2 by the average value, for that year, of all the *controlled foreign entity debt of the entity.

       * Step 4.	Reduce the result of step 3 by the average value, for that year, of all the *controlled foreign entity equity of the entity.

       * Step 5.	Reduce the result of step 4 by the average value, for that year, of all the *nondebt liabilities of the entity.

       * Step 6.	Reduce the result of step 5 by the amount (the **_average onlent amount_**) which is the average value, for that year, of the entity's *onlent amount (other than *controlled foreign entity debt of the entity). If the result of this step is a negative amount, it is taken to be nil.

       * Step 7.	Multiply the result of step 6 by 3/5.

       * Step 8.	Add to the result of step 7 the average onlent amount. 

       * Step 9.	Reduce the result of step 8 by the average value, for that year, of all the *associate entity debt of the entity.

       * Step 10.	Add to the result of step 9 the average value, for that year, of the entity's *associate entity excess amount. The result of this step is the **_adjusted onlent amount_**.

         * Example: GLM Limited, a company that is an Australian entity, has an average value of assets (other than assets attributable to its overseas permanent establishments) of $160 million.

         * The average values of its relevant excluded equity interests, associate entity equity, controlled foreign entity debt, controlled foreign entity equity, nondebt liabilities and onlent amount are $5 million, $5 million, $9 million, $6 million, $5 million and $35 million respectively. Deducting these amounts from the result of step 1 (through applying steps 1A to 6) leaves $95 million. Multiplying $95 million by 3/5 results in $57 million. Adding the average onlent amount of $35 million results in $92 million. Reducing the result of step 8 by the associate entity debt amount of $5 million equals $87 million. As the company does not have any associate entity excess amount, the adjusted onlent amount is therefore $87 million.

##### 820105  Arm's length debt amount

    * (1) The **_arm's length debt amount_** is a notional amount that, having regard to the factual assumptions set out in subsection (2) and the relevant factors mentioned in subsection (3), would satisfy both paragraphs (a) and (b):

     * (a) the amount represents a notional amount of *debt capital that:

       * (i) the entity would reasonably be expected to have throughout the income year; and

       * (ii) would give rise to an amount of *debt deductions of the entity for that or any other income year; and

       * (iii) would be attributable to the entity's Australian business as mentioned in subsection (2);

     * (b) commercial lending institutions that were not *associates of the entity (the **_notional lenders_**) would reasonably be expected to have entered into *schemes that would:

       * (i) give rise to *debt interests that constituted that notional amount of debt capital of the entity; and

       * (ii) provide for terms and conditions for the debt interests that would reasonably be expected to have applied if the entity and the notional lenders had been dealing at *arm's length with each other throughout the income year mentioned in subparagraph (1)(a)(i).

         * Note: The entity must keep records in accordance with section 820980 if the entity works out an amount under this section.

    * Factual assumptions

    * (2) Irrespective of what actually happened during that year, the following assumptions must be made in working out that amount:

     * (a) the entity's commercial activities in connection with  (the **_Australian business_**) during that year do not include:

       * (i) any *business carried on by the entity at or through its *overseas permanent establishments; and

       * (ii) the holding of any *associate entity debt, *controlled foreign entity debt or *controlled foreign entity equity; and

     * (b) the entity had carried on the Australian business that it actually carried on during that year;

     * (c) the nature of the entity's assets and liabilities (to the extent that they are attributable to the Australian business) had been as they were during that year;

     * is taken not to have been received by the entity;

     * (f) the entity's only activities during that year were the Australian business;

     * (g) the entity's only assets and liabilities during that year were those referred to in paragraph (c) of this subsection.

    * However, the assumptions set out in paragraphs (f) and (g) of this subsection are not to be made in taking into account the relevant factors mentioned in subsection (3).

    * Relevant factors

    * (3) On the basis of the factual assumptions set out in subsection (2), the following factors must be taken into account in determining whether or not an amount satisfies paragraphs (1)(a) and (b):

    * Commissioner's power

    * (4) If the Commissioner considers an amount worked out by the entity under this section does not appropriately take into account the factual assumptions and the relevant factors, the Commissioner may substitute another amount that the Commissioner considers better reflects those assumptions and factors.

##### 820110  Worldwide gearing debt amount--outward investor that is not also an inward investment vehicle

    * Outward investor (general) that is not also an inward investment vehicle (general)

    * (1) If the entity is an *outward investor (general) for the income year, and not also an *inward investment vehicle (general) for all or any part of that year, the **_worldwide gearing debt amount_** is the result of applying the method statement in this subsection.

Method statement

       * Step 1.	Divide the average value of all the entity's *worldwide debt for the income year by the average value of all the entity's *worldwide equity for that year.

       * Step 3.	Add 1 to the result of step 1.

       * Step 4.	Divide the result of step 1 by the result of step 3.

       * Step 5.	Multiply the result of step 4 in this method statement by the result of step 6 in the method statement in section 82095.

       * Step 6.	Add to the result of step 5 the average value, for that year, of the entity's *associate entity excess amount. The result of this step is the **_worldwide gearing debt amount_**.

         * Example: AK Pty Ltd, a company that is an Australian entity, has an average value of worldwide debt of $90 million and an average value of worldwide equity of $30 million. The result of applying step 1 is therefore 3. Dividing 3 by 4 (through applying steps 3 and 4) and multiplying the result by $65 million (which is the result of step 6 in the method statement in section 82095) equals $48.75 million. As the average value of the company's associate entity excess amount is $4.5 million, the worldwide gearing debt amount is therefore $53.25 million.

    * Outward investor (financial) that is not also an inward investment vehicle (financial)

    * (2) If the entity is an *outward investor (financial) for that year, and not also an *inward investment vehicle (financial) for all or any part of that year, the **_worldwide gearing debt amount_** is the result of applying the method statement in this subsection.

Method statement

       * Step 1.	Divide the average value of all the entity's *worldwide debt for the income year by the average value of all the entity's *worldwide equity for that year.

       * Step 3.	Add 1 to the result of step 1.

       * Step 4.	Divide the result of step 1 by the result of step 3.

       * Step 5.	Multiply the result of step 4 in this method statement by the result of step 7 in the method statement in subsection 820100(2).

       * Step 6.	Add to the result of step 5 the average value, for that year, of the entity's *zerocapital amount (other than any zerocapital amount that is attributable to the entity's *overseas permanent establishments).

       * Step 7.	Add to the result of step 6 the average value, for that year, of the entity's *associate entity excess amount. The result of this step is the **_worldwide gearing debt amount_**.

         * Example: GLM Limited, a company that is an Australian entity, has an average value of worldwide debt of $120 million and an average value of worldwide equity of $40 million. The result of applying step 1 is therefore 3. Dividing 3 by 4 (through applying steps 3 and 4) and multiplying the result by $121 million (which is the result of step 7 of the method statement in subsection 820100(2)) equals $90.75 million. The average value of zerocapital amount (see step 7 of the method statement in subsection 820100(2)) is $4 million. Adding that amount to $90.75 million results in $94.75 million. As the company does not have any associate entity excess amount, the worldwide gearing debt amount is therefore $94.75 million.

##### 820111  Worldwide gearing debt amount--outward investor that is also an inward investment vehicle

    * Outward investor (general)

    * (1) If the entity is an *outward investor (general) for the income year, and is also an *inward investment vehicle (general) for all or any part of that year, the **_worldwide gearing debt amount_** is the result of applying the method statement in this subsection.

Method statement

       * Step 1.	Divide the entity's *statement worldwide debt for the income year by the entity's *statement worldwide equity for that year.

       * Step 2.	Add 1 to the result of step 1.

       * Step 3.	Divide the result of step 1 by the result of step 2.

       * Step 4.	Multiply the result of step 3 in this method statement by the result of step 6 in the method statement in section 82095.

       * Step 5.	Add to the result of step 4 the average value, for that year, of the entity's *associate entity excess amount. The result of this step is the **_worldwide gearing debt amount_**.

         * Example: RKR Limited, a company that is an Australian entity, has a worldwide parent entity in Canada. RKR Limited also has permanent establishments in Singapore. RKR Limited has statement worldwide debt of $120 million and statement worldwide equity of $40 million. The result of applying step 1 is therefore 3. Dividing 3 by 4 (through applying steps 2 and 3) and multiplying the result by $75 million (which is the result of step 6 of the method statement in section 82095) equals $56.25 million. As the average value of the company's associate entity excess amount is $4 million, the worldwide gearing debt amount is therefore $60.25 million.

    * Outward investor (financial)

    * (2) If the entity is an *outward investor (financial) for the income year, and is also an *inward investment vehicle (financial) for all or any part of that year, the **_worldwide gearing debt amount_** is the result of applying the method statement in this subsection.

Method statement

       * Step 1.	Divide the entity's *statement worldwide debt for the income year by the entity's *statement worldwide equity for that year.

       * Step 2.	Add 1 to the result of step 1.

       * Step 3.	Divide the result of step 1 by the result of step 2.

       * Step 4.	Multiply the result of step 3 in this method statement by the result of step 7 in the method statement in subsection 820100(2).

       * Step 5.	Add to the result of step 4 the average value, for that year, of the entity's *zerocapital amount (other than any zerocapital amount that is attributable to the entity's *overseas permanent establishments).

       * Step 6.	Add to the result of step 5 the average value, for that year, of the entity's *associate entity excess amount. The result of this step is the **_worldwide gearing debt amount_**.

         * Example: TRR Limited, a company that is an Australian entity, has a worldwide parent entity in the United States of America. TRR Limited also has permanent establishments in Malaysia. TRR Limited has statement worldwide debt of $90 million and statement worldwide equity of $30 million. The result of applying step 1 is therefore 3. Dividing 3 by 4 (through applying steps 2 and 3) and multiplying the result by $100 million (which is the result of step 7 of the method statement in subsection 820100(2)) equals $75 million. The zero capital amount is $5 million. Adding that amount to $75 million results in $80 million. As the company does not have any associate entity excess amount, the worldwide gearing debt amount is therefore $80 million.

##### 820115  Amount of debt deduction disallowed

    * The amount of *debt deduction disallowed under subsection 82085(1) is worked out using the following formula:

    * where: 

    * **_average debt_** means the sum of:

     * (a) the average value, for the income year, of the entity's *debt capital that is covered by step 1 of the method statement in subsection 82085(3); and

     * (b) the average value, for that year, of the entity's *costfree debt capital that is covered by step 5 of that method statement;

    * (disregarding any amount that is attributable to the entity's *overseas permanent establishments in working out the average values).

    * **_debt deduction_** means each *debt deduction covered by subsection 82085(1).

    * **_excess debt_** means the amount by which the entity's *adjusted average debt for that year (see subsection 82085(3)) exceeds its *maximum allowable debt for that year.

         * Note: The disallowed amount also does not form part of the cost base of a CGT asset. See section 11054.

##### 820120  Application to part year periods

    * (1) This subsection disallows all or a part of each *debt deduction of an entity for an income year that is an amount incurred by the entity during a period that is a part of that year (to the extent that it is not attributable to an *overseas permanent establishment of the entity), if:

     * (a) the entity is an *outward investing entity (nonADI) for that period; and

     * (b) the entity's *adjusted average debt for that period exceeds the entity's *maximum allowable debt for that period.

         * Note: To determine whether an entity is an outward investing entity (nonADI) for that period, see subsection 82085(2).

    * (2) The entity's **_adjusted average debt_** for that period is the result of applying the method statement in this subsection. In applying the method statement, disregard any amount that is attributable to the entity's *overseas permanent establishments.

Method statement

       * Step 1.	Work out the average value, for that period, of all the *debt capital of the entity that gives rise to *debt deductions of the entity for that or any other income year.

       * Step 2.	Reduce the result of step 1 by the average value, for that period, of all the *associate entity debt of the entity.

       * Step 3.	Reduce the result of step 2 by the average value, for that period, of all the *controlled foreign entity debt of the entity.

       * Step 4.	If the entity is a *financial entity throughout that period, add to the result of step 3 the average value, for that period, of the entity's *borrowed securities amount.

       * Step 5.	Add to the result of step 4 the average value, for that period, of the *costfree debt capital of the entity. The result of this step is the **_adjusted average debt_**.

    * (3) The entity's *adjusted average debt does not exceed its *maximum allowable debt if the adjusted average debt is nil or a negative amount.

    * (4) For the purposes of determining:

     * (a) the *maximum allowable debt for the period mentioned in subsection (1); and

     * (b) the amount of each *debt deduction to be disallowed;

    * sections 82090 to 820115 apply in relation to that entity and that period with the modifications set out in the following table: 

##### Subdivision 820C--Thin capitalisation rules for inward investing entities (nonADI)

##### Operative provisions

##### 820185  Thin capitalisation rule for inward investing entities (nonADI)

    * Thin capitalisation rule

    * (1) This subsection disallows all or a part of each *debt deduction of an entity for an income year if:

     * (a) the entity is an *inward investing entity (nonADI) for that year (see subsection (2)), but is not also an *outward investing entity (nonADI) (see section 82085) for all or any part of that year; and

     * (b) for that year, the entity's *adjusted average debt (see subsection (3)) exceeds its *maximum allowable debt (see section 820190).

         * Note 1: This Subdivision does not apply if the total debt deductions of that entity and all its associate entities for that year are $2 million or less, see section 82035.

         * Note 2: To work out the amount to be disallowed, see section 820220.

         * Note 3: For the rules that apply to an entity that is an outward investing entity (nonADI) as well as an inward investing entity (nonADI), see Subdivision 820B.

         * Note 4: For the rules that apply to an entity that is an inward investing entity (nonADI) for only a part of an income year, see section 820225 in conjunction with subsection (2) of this section.

         * Note 5: To calculate an average value for the purposes of this Division, see Subdivision 820G.

         * Note 6: A consolidated group or MEC group may be an inward investing entity (nonADI) to which this Subdivision applies: see Subdivisions 820FA and 820FB.

    * Inward investing entity (nonADI)

    * (2) The entity is an **_inward investing entity (nonADI) _**for a period that is all or a part of an income year if, and only if, it is:

     * (a) an *inward investment vehicle (general) for that period (as set out in item 1 of the following table); or

     * (b) an *inward investment vehicle (financial) for that period (as set out in item 2 of that table); or

     * (c) an *inward investor (general) for that period (as set out in item 3 of that table); or

     * (d) an *inward investor (financial) for that period (as set out in item 4 of that table).

         * Note 1: To determine whether an entity is a foreign controlled Australian entity, see Subdivision 820H.

         * Note 2: The rules that apply to these 4 types of entities are different in some instances. For example, see sections 820195 to 820210.

         * Note 3: An entity covered by item 3 or 4 of the table may be required to keep certain records, see Subdivision 820L.

    * Adjusted average debt

    * (3) The entity's **_adjusted average debt_** for an income year is the result of applying the method statement in this subsection.

Method statement

       * Step 1.	Work out the average value, for that year (the **_relevant year_**), of all the *debt capital of the entity that gives rise to *debt deductions of the entity for that or any other income year.

       * Step 2.	Reduce the result of step 1 by the average value, for the relevant year, of:

         * (a) if the entity is an *inward investment vehicle (general) or an *inward investment vehicle (financial) for that year--all the *associate entity debt of the entity; or

         * (b) if the entity is an *inward investor (general) or an *inward investor (financial) for that year--all the associate entity debt of the entity, to the extent that it is attributable to the entity's *Australian permanent establishments.

       * Step 3.	If the entity is a *financial entity throughout the relevant year, add to the result of step 2 the average value, for the relevant year, of the entity's *borrowed securities amount.

       * Step 4.	Add to the result of step 3 the average value, for the relevant year, of the *costfree debt capital of the entity. The result of this step is the **_adjusted average debt._**

         * _**Note:	To calculate an average value for the purposes of this Division, see Subdivision 820G.

    * (4) The entity's *adjusted average debt does not exceed its *maximum allowable debt if the adjusted average debt is nil or a negative amount.

##### 820190  Maximum allowable debt

    * (1) The entity's **_maximum allowable debt_** for an income year is the greatest of the following amounts:

     * (a) the *safe harbour debt amount;

     * (b) the *arm's length debt amount;

     * (c) unless subsection (2) applies to the entity--the *worldwide gearing debt amount.

         * Note 1: The safe harbour debt amount differs depending on whether the entity is an inward investment vehicle (general), inward investment vehicle (financial), inward investor (general) or inward investor (financial), see sections 820195 to 820215.

         * Note 2: The worldwide gearing debt amount differs depending on whether the entity is an inward investment vehicle (general), inward investment vehicle (financial), inward investor (general) or an inward investor (financial), see sections 820216 to 820219.

    * Entities that are not eligible for the worldwide gearing debt amount

    * (2) This subsection applies to an entity, if:

     * (a) the entity has *statement worldwide equity, or *statement worldwide assets, of nil or a negative amount; or

     * (b) *audited consolidated financial statements for the entity for the income year do not exist; or

     * (c) the result of applying the following formula is greater than 0.5:

    * where: 

    * **_average Australian assets_**:

     * (a) of an *Australian entity--is the average value, for the statement period mentioned in subsection (3), of all the assets of the entity, other than:

       * (i) any *debt interests held by the entity, to the extent to which any value of the interests is all or a part of the *controlled foreign entity debt of the entity; or

       * (ii) any *equity interests or debt interests held by the entity, to the extent to which any value of the interests is all or a part of the *controlled foreign entity equity of the entity; and

     * (b) of a *foreign entity--is the average value, for the statement period mentioned in subsection (3), of all the assets of the entity that are:

       * (i) located in Australia; or

       * (ii) attributable to the entity's *Australian permanent establishments; or

       * (iii) debt interests held by the entity, that were *issued by an *Australian entity and are *on issue;

       * (iv) equity interests held by the entity in an *Australian entity.

    * (3) For the purposes of the definition of **_average Australian assets_** in subsection (2) the statement period is the period for which the *audited consolidated financial statements for the entity for the income year have been prepared.

    * (4) For the purposes of the formula in paragraph (2)(c), if:

     * (a) an amount is included in *statement worldwide assets in respect of an asset; and

     * (b) the asset was acquired, held or otherwise dealt with by an entity for a purpose (other than an incidental purpose) that included ensuring that subsection (2) does not apply to an entity; and

     * (c) as a result of the acquisition, holding or dealing with of the asset, the amount included in statement worldwide assets exceeds the amount (including nil) that would otherwise be so included;

    * apply the amount of the excess to reduce statement worldwide assets (or statement worldwide assets as reduced by a previous application of this subsection).

##### 820195  Safe harbour debt amount--inward investment vehicle (general)

    * If the entity is an *inward investment vehicle (general) for the income year, the **_safe harbour debt amount_** is the result of applying the method statement in this section.

Method statement

       * Step 1.	Work out the average value, for the income year, of all the assets of the entity.

       * Step 1A.	Reduce the result of step 1 by the average value, for that year, of all the *excluded equity interests in the entity.

       * Step 2.	Reduce the result of step 1A by the average value, for that year, of all the *associate entity debt of the entity.

       * Step 3.	Reduce the result of step 2 by the average value, for that year, of all the *associate entity equity of the entity.

       * Step 4.	Reduce the result of step 3 by the average value, for that year, of all the *nondebt liabilities of the entity. If the result of this step is a negative amount, it is taken to be nil.

       * Step 5.	Multiply the result of step 4 by 3/5.

       * Step 6.	Add to the result of step 5 the average value, for that year, of the entity's *associate entity excess amount. The result of this step is the **_safe harbour debt amount_**.

         * Example: ALWZ Ltd, a company that is an Australian entity, has an average value of assets of $100 million.

         * The average values of its excluded equity interests, associate entity debt, associate entity equity and nondebt liabilities are $5 million, $10 million, $5 million and $5 million respectively. Deducting these amounts from the result of step 1 (through applying steps 1A to 4) leaves $75 million. Multiplying $75 million by 3/5 results in $45 million. As the average value of the company's associate entity excess amount is $2 million, the safe harbour debt amount is therefore $47 million.

##### 820200  Safe harbour debt amount--inward investment vehicle (financial)

    * (1) If the entity is an *inward investment vehicle (financial) for the income year, the **_safe harbour debt amount_** is the lesser of the following amounts:

     * (a) the *total debt amount (worked out under subsection (2));

     * (b) the *adjusted onlent amount (worked out under subsection (3)).

    * However, if the 2 amounts are equal, it is the total debt amount.

    * Total debt amount

    * (2) The **_total debt amount_** is the result of the method statement in this subsection.

Method statement

       * Step 1.	Work out the average value, for the income year, of all the assets of the entity.

       * Step 1A.	Reduce the result of step 1 by the average value, for that year, of all the *excluded equity interests in the entity.

       * Step 2.	Reduce the result of step 1A by the average value, for that year, of all the *associate entity debt of the entity.

       * Step 3.	Reduce the result of step 2 by the average value, for that year, of all the *associate entity equity of the entity.

       * Step 4.	Reduce the result of step 3 by the average value, for that year, of all the *nondebt liabilities of the entity.

       * Step 5.	Reduce the result of step 4 by the average value, for that year, of the entity's *zerocapital amount. If the result of this step is a negative amount, it is taken to be nil.

       * Step 6.	Multiply the result of step 5 by 15/16.

       * Step 7.	Add to the result of step 6 the average value, for that year, of the entity's *zerocapital amount.

       * Step 8.	Add to the result of step 7 the average value, for that year, of the entity's *associate entity excess amount. The result of this step is the **_total debt amount_**.

         * Example: KJW Finance Pty Ltd, a company that is an Australian entity, has an average value of assets of $120 million.

         * The average values of its excluded equity interests, associate entity debt, associate entity equity, its nondebt liabilities and its zerocapital amount are $5 million, $5 million, $3 million, $2 million and $5 million respectively. Deducting these amounts from the result of step 1 (through applying steps 1A to 5) leaves $100 million. Multiplying $100 million by 15/16 results in $93.75 million. Adding the zerocapital amount of $5 million to $93.75 million results in $98.75 million. As the company does not have any associate entity excess amount, the total debt amount is therefore $98.75 million.

    * Adjusted onlent amount

    * (3) The **_adjusted onlent amount_** is the result of applying the method statement in this subsection.

Method statement

       * Step 1.	Work out the average value, for the income year, of all the assets of the entity.

       * Step 1A.	Reduce the result of step 1 by the average value, for that year, of all the *excluded equity interests in the entity.

       * Step 2.	Reduce the result of step 1A by the average value, for that year, of all the *associate entity equity of the entity.

       * Step 3.	Reduce the result of step 2 by the average value, for that year, of all the *nondebt liabilities of the entity.

       * Step 4.	Reduce the result of step 3 by the amount (the **_average onlent amount_**) which is the average value, for that year, of the entity's *onlent amount. If the result of this step is a negative amount, it is taken to be nil.

       * Step 5.	Multiply the result of step 4 by 3/5.

       * Step 6.	Add to the result of step 5 the average onlent amount.

       * Step 7.	Reduce the result of step 6 by the average value, for that year, of all the *associate entity debt of the entity.

       * Step 8.	Add to the result of step 7 the average value, for that year, of the entity's *associate entity excess amount. The result of this step is the **_adjusted onlent amount_**.

         * Example: KJW Finance Pty Ltd, a company that is an Australian entity, has an average value of assets of $120 million.

         * The average values of its excluded equity interests, associate entity equity, nondebt liabilities and onlent amount are $5 million, $3 million, $2 million and $35 million respectively. Deducting these amounts from the result of step 1 (through applying steps 1A to 4) leaves $75 million. Multiplying $75 million by 3/5 results in $45 million. Adding the average onlent amount of $35 million results in $80 million. Reducing $80 million by the associate entity debt amount of $5 million results in $75 million. As the company does not have any associate entity excess amount, the adjusted onlent amount is therefore $75 million.

##### 820205  Safe harbour debt amount--inward investor (general)

    * If the entity is an *inward investor (general) for the income year, the **_safe harbour debt amount_** is the result of applying the method statement in this section.

Method statement

       * Step 1.	Work out the average value, for the income year, of all of the following assets of the entity (the **_Australian investments_**):

         * (a) assets that are attributable to the entity's *Australian permanent establishments;

         * (b) other assets that are held for the purposes of producing the entity's assessable income.

       * Step 1A.	Reduce the result of step 1 by the average value, for that year, of all the *excluded equity interests in the entity.

       * Step 2.	Reduce the result of step 1A by the average value, for that year, of all the *associate entity debt of the entity that has arisen because of the Australian investments.

       * Step 3.	Reduce the result of step 2 by the average value, for that year, of all the *associate entity equity of the entity that has arisen because of the Australian investments.

       * Step 4.	Reduce the result of step 3 by the average value, for that year, of all the *nondebt liabilities of the entity that have arisen because of the Australian investments. If the result of this step is a negative amount, it is taken to be nil.

       * Step 5.	Multiply the result of step 4 by 3/5.

       * Step 6.	Add to the result of step 5 the average value, for that year, of the entity's *associate entity excess amount. The result of this step is the **_safe harbour debt amount_**.

         * Example: RJ Corporation is a company that is not an Australian entity. The average value of its Australian investments is $100 million.

         * The average value of its relevant excluded equity interests, associate entity debt, associate entity equity and nondebt liabilities is $5 million, $10 million, $5 million and $5 million respectively. Deducting those amounts from the result of step 1 leaves $75 million. Multiplying $75 million by 3/5 results in $45 million. As the company does not have any associate entity excess amount, the safe harbour debt amount is therefore $45 million.

##### 820210  Safe harbour debt amount--inward investor (financial)

    * (1) If the entity is an *inward investor (financial) for that year, the **_safe harbour debt amount_** is the lesser of the following amounts:

     * (a) the *total debt amount (worked out under subsection (2));

     * (b) the *adjusted onlent amount (worked out under subsection (3)).

    * However, if the 2 amounts are equal, it is the total debt amount.

    * Total debt amount

    * (2) The **_total debt amount_** is the result of applying the method statement in this subsection.

Method statement

       * Step 1.	Work out the average value, for the income year, of all of the following assets of the entity (the **_Australian investments_**):

         * (a) assets that are attributable to the entity's *Australian permanent establishments;

         * (b) other assets that are held for the purposes of producing the entity's assessable income.

       * Step 1A.	Reduce the result of step 1 by the average value, for that year, of all the *excluded equity interests in the entity.

       * Step 2.	Reduce the result of step 1A by the average value, for that year, of all the *associate entity debt of the entity that has arisen because of the Australian investments.

       * Step 3.	Reduce the result of step 2 by the average value, for that year, of all the *associate entity equity of the entity that has arisen because of the Australian investments.

       * Step 4.	Reduce the result of step 3 by the average value, for that year, of all the *nondebt liabilities of the entity that have arisen because of the Australian investments.

       * Step 5.	Reduce the result of step 4 by the average value, for that year, of the entity's *zerocapital amount that has arisen because of the Australian investments. If the result of this step is a negative amount, it is taken to be nil.

       * Step 6.	Multiply the result of step 5 by 15/16.

       * Step 7.	Add to the result of step 6 the average value, for that year, of the entity's *zerocapital amount that has arisen because of the Australian investments.

       * Step 8.	Add to the result of step 7 the average value, for that year, of the entity's *associate entity excess amount. The result of this step is the **_total debt amount_**.

         * Example: FXS Financial SA is a company that is not an Australian entity. The average value of its Australian investments is $120 million.

         * The average value of its relevant excluded equity interests, associate entity debt, associate entity equity, nondebt liabilities and zerocapital amount are $5 million, $5 million, $2 million, $3 million and $5 million respectively. Deducting those amounts from the result of step 1 (through applying steps 1A to 5) leaves $100 million. Multiplying $100 million by 15/16 results in $93.75 million. Adding the average zerocapital amount of $5 million results in $98.75 million. As the company does not have any associate entity excess amount, the total debt amount is therefore $98.75 million.

    * Adjusted onlent amount

    * (3) The **_adjusted onlent amount_** is the result of applying the method statement in this subsection.

Method statement

       * Step 1.	Work out the average value, for the income year, of all of the following assets of the entity (the **_Australian investments_**):

         * (a) assets that are attributable to the entity's *Australian permanent establishments;

         * (b) other assets that are held for the purposes of producing the entity's assessable income.

       * Step 1A.	Reduce the result of step 1 by the average value, for that year, of all the *excluded equity interests in the entity.

       * Step 2.	Reduce the result of step 1A by the average value, for that year, of all the *associate entity equity of the entity that has arisen because of the Australian investments.

       * Step 3.	Reduce the result of step 2 by the average value, for that year, of all the *nondebt liabilities of the entity that has arisen because of the Australian investments.

       * Step 4.	Reduce the result of step 3 by the amount (the **_average onlent amount_**) which is the average value, for that year, of the *onlent amount of the entity (to the extent that it is the value of all or a part of the Australian investments). If the result of this step is a negative amount, it is taken to be nil.

       * Step 5.	Multiply the result of step 4 by 3/5.

       * Step 6.	Add to the result of step 5 the average onlent amount.

       * Step 7.	Reduce the result of step 6 by the average value, for that year, of all the *associate entity debt of the entity that has arisen because of the Australian investments. If the result of this step is a negative amount, it is taken to be nil.

       * Step 8.	Add to the result of step 7 the average value, for that year, of the entity's *associate entity excess amount. The result of this step is the **_adjusted onlent amount_**.

         * Example: FXS Financial SA is a company that is not an Australian entity. The average value of its Australian investments is $120 million.

         * The average value of its relevant excluded equity interests, associate entity equity, nondebt liabilities and onlent amount are $5 million, $2 million, $3 million and $35 million respectively. Deducting those amounts from the result of step 1 (through applying steps 1A to 4) leaves $75 million. Multiplying $75 million by 3/5 results in $45 million. Adding the average onlent amount of $35 million results in $80 million. Reducing the result of step 6 by the associate entity debt amount of $5 million results in $75 million. As the company does not have any associate entity excess amount, the adjusted onlent amount is therefore $75 million.

##### 820215  Arm's length debt amount

    * (1) The **_arm's length debt amount_** is a notional amount that, having regard to the factual assumptions set out in subsection (2) and the relevant factors mentioned in subsection (3), would satisfy both paragraphs (a) and (b):

     * (a) the amount represents a notional amount of *debt capital that:

       * (i) the entity would reasonably be expected to have throughout the income year; and

       * (ii) would give rise to an amount of *debt deductions of the entity for that or any other income year; and

       * (iii) would be attributable to the entity's Australian business as mentioned in subsection (2);

     * (b) commercial lending institutions that were not *associates of the entity (the **_notional lenders_**) would reasonably be expected to have entered into *schemes that would:

       * (i) give rise to *debt interests that constituted that notional amount of debt capital of the entity; and

       * (ii) provide for terms and conditions for the debt interests that would reasonably be expected to have applied if the entity and the notional lenders had been dealing at *arm's length with each other throughout the income year mentioned in subparagraph (1)(a)(i).

         * Note: The entity must keep records in accordance with section 820980 if the entity works out an amount under this section.

    * Factual assumptions

    * (2) Irrespective of what actually happened during that year, the following assumptions must be made in working out that amount:

     * (a) the entity's commercial activities in connection with  (the **_Australian business_**) during that year:

       * (i) if the entity is an *inward investment vehicle (general) or *inward investment vehicle (financial) for that year--do not include the holding of any *associate entity debt; and

       * (ii) if the entity is an *inward investor (general) or *inward investor (financial) for that year--consist only of its Australian investments (within the meaning of section 820205 or 820210, as appropriate), other than the holding of any associate entity debt that is attributable to its *Australian permanent establishments;

     * (b) the entity had carried on the Australian business that it actually carried on during that year;

     * (c) the nature of the entity's assets and liabilities (to the extent that they are attributable to the Australian business) had been as they were during that year;

     * (d) except as stated in paragraph (1)(b) and paragraphs (e), (f) and (g) of this subsection, the entity had carried on the Australian business in the same circumstances as what actually existed during that year;

     * (e) any guarantee, security or other form of credit support provided to the entity in relation to the Australian business during that year:

       * (i) by its *associates; or

       * (ii) by the use of assets of the entity that are attributable to the entity's overseas permanent establishments;

     * is taken not to have been received by the entity;

     * (f) the entity's only activities during that year were the Australian business;

     * (g) the entity's only assets and liabilities during that year were those referred to in paragraph (c) of this subsection.

    * However, the assumptions set out in paragraphs (f) and (g) of this subsection are not to be made in taking into account the relevant factors mentioned in subsection (3).

    * Relevant factors

    * (3) On the basis of the factual assumptions set out in subsection (2), the following factors must be taken into account in determining whether or not an amount satisfies paragraphs (1)(a) and (b):

     * (a) the functions performed, the assets used, and the risks assumed, by the entity in relation to the Australian business throughout that year;

     * (b) the terms and conditions of the *debt capital that the entity actually had in relation to the Australian business throughout that year;

     * (c) the nature of, and title to, any assets of the entity attributable to the Australian business that were available to the entity throughout that year as security for its debt capital for that business;

     * (d) the purposes for which *schemes for debt capital had been actually entered into by the entity in relation to the Australian business throughout that year;

     * (e) the entity's capacity to meet all its liabilities in relation to the Australian business (whether during that year or at any other time);

     * (f) the profit of the entity (within the meaning of the *accounting standards), and the return on its capital, in relation to the Australian business (whether during that year or at any other time);

     * (g) the debt to equity ratios of the following throughout that year:

       * (i) the entity;

       * (ii) the entity in relation to the Australian business;

       * (iii) each of the entity's *associate entities that engage in commercial activities similar to the Australian business;

     * (h) the commercial practices adopted by independent parties dealing with each other at *arm's length in the industry in which the entity carries on the Australian business throughout that year (whether in Australia or in comparable markets elsewhere);

     * (i) the general state of the Australian economy throughout that year;

     * (j) all of the above factors existing at the time when the entity last entered into a *scheme that gave rise to an actual *debt interest attributable to the Australian business that remains *on issue throughout that year;

     * (k) any other factors which are specified in the regulations made for the purposes of this section, including factors that are specific to an *inward investment vehicle (general), an *inward investment vehicle (financial), an *inward investor (general) or an *inward investor (financial).

    * Commissioner's power

    * (4) If the Commissioner considers an amount worked out by the entity under this section does not appropriately take into account the factual assumptions and the relevant factors, the Commissioner may substitute another amount that the Commissioner considers better reflects those assumptions and factors.

##### 820216  Worldwide gearing debt amount--inward investment vehicle (general)

    * If the entity is an *inward investment vehicle (general) for the income year, and is not also an *outward investor (general) for all or any part of that year, the **_worldwide gearing debt amount_** is the result of applying the method statement in this section.

Method statement

       * Step 1.	Divide the entity's *statement worldwide debt for the income year by the entity's *statement worldwide equity for that year.

       * Step 2.	Add 1 to the result of step 1.

       * Step 3.	Divide the result of step 1 by the result of step 2.

       * Step 4.	Multiply the result of step 3 in this method statement by the result of step 4 in the method statement in section 820195.

       * Step 5.	Add to the result of step 4 the average value, for that year, of the entity's *associate entity excess amount. The result of this step is the **_worldwide gearing debt amount_**.

         * Example: SJP Limited, a company that is an Australian entity, has a worldwide parent entity in Japan. SJP Limited has statement worldwide debt of $120 million and statement worldwide equity of $40 million. The result of applying step 1 is therefore 3. Dividing 3 by 4 (through applying steps 2 and 3) and multiplying the result by $75 million (which is the result of step 4 of the method statement in section 820195) equals $56.25 million. As the average value of the company's associate entity excess amount is $4 million, the worldwide gearing debt amount is therefore $60.25 million.

##### 820217  Worldwide gearing debt amount--inward investment vehicle (financial)

    * If the entity is an *inward investment vehicle (financial) for the income year, and is not also an *outward investor (financial) for all or any part of that year, the **_worldwide gearing debt amount_** is the result of applying the method statement in this section.

Method statement

       * Step 1.	Divide the entity's *statement worldwide debt for the income year by the entity's *statement worldwide equity for that year.

       * Step 2.	Add 1 to the result of step 1.

       * Step 3.	Divide the result of step 1 by the result of step 2.

       * Step 4.	Multiply the result of step 3 in this method statement by the result of step 5 in the method statement in subsection 820200(2).

       * Step 5.	Add to the result of step 4 the average value, for that year, of the entity's *zerocapital amount.

       * Step 6.	Add to the result of step 5 the average value, for that year, of the entity's *associate entity excess amount. The result of this step is the **_worldwide gearing debt amount_**.

         * Example: RGR Limited, a company that is an Australian entity, has a worldwide parent entity in France. RGR Limited has statement worldwide debt of $90 million and statement worldwide equity of $30 million. The result of applying step 1 is therefore 3. Dividing 3 by 4 (through applying steps 2 and 3) and multiplying the result by $100 million (which is the result of step 5 of the method statement in subsection 820200(2)) equals $75 million. The zero capital amount is $5 million. Adding that amount to $75 million results in $80 million. As the company does not have any associate entity excess amount, the worldwide gearing debt amount is therefore $80 million.

##### 820218  Worldwide gearing debt amount--inward investor (general)

    * If the entity is an *inward investor (general) for the income year, the **_worldwide gearing debt amount_** is the result of applying the method statement in this section.

Method statement

       * Step 1.	Divide the entity's *statement worldwide debt for the income year by the entity's *statement worldwide equity for that year.

       * Step 2.	Add 1 to the result of step 1.

       * Step 3.	Divide the result of step 1 by the result of step 2.

       * Step 4.	Multiply the result of step 3 in this method statement by the result of step 4 in the method statement in section 820205.

       * Step 5.	Add to the result of step 4 the average value, for that year, of the entity's *associate entity excess amount. The result of this step is the **_worldwide gearing debt amount_**.

         * Example: MLO Limited, a company that is not an Australian entity, has investments in Australia. MLO Limited has statement worldwide debt of $120 million and statement worldwide equity of $40 million.

         * The result of applying step 1 is therefore 3. Dividing 3 by 4 (through applying steps 2 and 3) and multiplying the result by $75 million (which is the result of step 4 of the method statement in section 820205) equals $56.25 million. As the average value of the company's associate entity excess amount is $4 million, the worldwide gearing debt amount is therefore $60.25 million.

##### 820219  Worldwide gearing debt amount--inward investor (financial)

    * If the entity is an *inward investor (financial) for the income year, the **_worldwide gearing debt amount_** is the result of applying the method statement in this section.

Method statement

       * Step 1.	Divide the entity's *statement worldwide debt for the income year by the entity's *statement worldwide equity for that year.

       * Step 2.	Add 1 to the result of step 1.

       * Step 3.	Divide the result of step 1 by the result of step 2.

       * Step 4.	Multiply the result of step 3 in this method statement by the result of step 5 in the method statement in subsection 820210(2).

       * Step 5.	Add to the result of step 4 the average value, for that year, of the entity's *zerocapital amount that has arisen because of the Australian investments mentioned in step 1 of the method statement in subsection 820210(2).

       * Step 6.	Add to the result of step 5 the average value, for that year, of the entity's *associate entity excess amount. The result of this step is the **_worldwide gearing debt amount_**.

         * Example: MSR Limited, a company that is not an Australian entity, has investments in Australia. MSR Limited has statement worldwide debt of $90 million and statement worldwide equity of $30 million. The result of applying step 1 is therefore 3. Dividing 3 by 4 (through applying steps 2 and 3) and multiplying the result by $100 million (which is the result of step 5 of the method statement in subsection 820210(2)) equals $75 million. The zerocapital amount is $5 million. Adding that amount to $75 million results in $80 million. As the company does not have any associate entity excess amount, the worldwide gearing debt amount is therefore $80 million.

##### 820220  Amount of debt deduction disallowed

    * The amount of *debt deduction disallowed under subsection 820185(1) is worked out using the following formula:

    * where: 

    * **_average debt_** means the sum of:

     * (a) the average value, for the income year, of the entity's *debt capital that is covered by step 1 of the method statement in subsection 820185(3); and

     * (b) the average value, for that year, of the entity's *costfree debt capital that is covered by step 4 of that method statement.

    * **_debt deduction _**means each *debt deduction of the entity for that year.

    * **_excess debt_** means the amount by which the *adjusted average debt (see subsection 820185(3)) exceeds the entity's *maximum allowable debt for that year.

         * Note: The disallowed amount also does not form part of the cost base of a CGT asset. See section 11054.

##### 820225  Application to part year periods

    * (1) This subsection disallows all or a part of each *debt deduction of an entity for an income year that is an amount incurred by the entity during a period that is a part of that year, if:

     * (a) the entity is an *inward investing entity (nonADI) for that period, but is not also an *outward investing entity (nonADI) for all or any part of that period; and

     * (b) the entity's *adjusted average debt for that period exceeds the entity's *maximum allowable debt for that period.

         * Note: To determine whether an entity is an inward investing entity (nonADI) for a period, see subsection 820185(2).

    * (2) The entity's **_adjusted average debt_** for that period is the result of applying the method statement in this subsection.

Method statement

       * Step 1.	Work out the average value, for that period, of all the *debt capital of the entity that gives rise to *debt deductions of the entity for that or any other income year.

       * Step 2.	Reduce the result of step 1 by the average value, for that period, of:

         * (a) if the entity is an *inward investment vehicle (general) or an *inward investment vehicle (financial) for that period--all the *associate entity debt of the entity; or

         * (b) if the entity is an *inward investor (general) or an *inward investor (financial) for that period--all the associate entity debt of the entity, to the extent that it is attributable to the entity's *Australian permanent establishments.

       * Step 3.	If the entity is a *financial entity throughout that period, add to the result of step 2 the average value, for that period, of the entity's *borrowed securities amount.

       * Step 4.	Add to the result of step 3 the average value, for that period, of the *costfree debt capital of the entity. The result of this step is the **_adjusted average debt_**.

         * Note: To calculate an average value for the purposes of this Division, see Subdivision 820G.

    * (2A) The entity's *adjusted average debt does not exceed its *maximum allowable debt if the adjusted average debt is nil or a negative amount.

    * (3) For the purposes of determining:

     * (a) the *maximum allowable debt for the period mentioned in subsection (1); and

     * (b) the amount of each *debt deduction to be disallowed;

    * sections 820190 to 820220 apply in relation to that entity and that period with the modifications set out in the following table: 

##### Subdivision 820D--Thin capitalisation rules for outward investing entities (ADI)

##### Guide to Subdivision 820D

##### 820295  What this Subdivision is about

    * This Subdivision sets out the thin capitalisation rules that apply to an entity that is both an authorised deposittaking institution (an **_ADI_**) and an Australian entity that has certain types of overseas investments. These rules deal with the following matters:

     *  	how to work out the entity's minimum capital amount for an income year;

     *  	how all or a part of the debt deductions claimed by the entity may be disallowed if the minimum capital amount is not reached;

     *  	how to apply these rules to a period that is less than an income year.

##### Operative provisions

##### 820300  Thin capitalisation rule for outward investing entities (ADI)

    * Thin capitalisation rule

    * (1) This subsection disallows all or a part of each *debt deduction of an entity for an income year (to the extent that it is not attributable to an *overseas permanent establishment of the entity) if, for that year:

     * (a) the entity is an *outward investing entity (ADI) (see subsection (2)); and

     * (b) the entity's *adjusted average equity capital (see subsection (3)) is less than the entity's *minimum capital amount (see section 820305).

         * Note 1: This Subdivision does not apply if the total debt deductions of that entity and all its associate entities for that year are $2 million or less, see section 82035.

         * Note 2: To work out the amount to be disallowed, see section 820325.

         * Note 3: For the rules that apply to an entity that is an outward investing entity (ADI) for only part of an income year, see section 820330 in conjunction with subsection (2) of this section.

         * Note 4: A consolidated group or MEC group may be an outward investing entity (ADI) to which this Subdivision applies: see Subdivisions 820FA and 820FB.

    * Outward investing entity (ADI)

    * (2) The entity is an **_outward investing entity (ADI)_** for a period that is all or a part of an income year if, and only if, throughout that period, the entity is an *ADI to which at least one of the following paragraphs applies:

     * (a) the entity is an *Australian controller of at least one *Australian controlled foreign entity (not necessarily the same Australian controlled foreign entity throughout that period);

     * (b) the entity is an *Australian entity that carries on a *business at or through at least one *overseas permanent establishment (not necessarily the same permanent establishment throughout that period);

     * (c) the entity is:

       * (i) an Australian entity; and

       * (ii) an *associate entity of another entity that is an *outward investing entity (nonADI) or an *outward investing entity (ADI) for that period.

         * Note: To determine whether an entity is an Australian controller of an Australian controlled foreign entity, see Subdivision 820H.

    * Adjusted average equity capital

    * (3) The entity's **_adjusted average equity capital_** for an income year is:

     * (a) the average value, for that year, of all the *ADI equity capital of the entity (other than ADI equity capital attributable to its *overseas permanent establishments); minus

     * (b) the average value, for that year, of all the *controlled foreign entity equity of the entity (other than controlled foreign entity equity attributable to its overseas permanent establishments).

         * Note: To calculate an average value for the purposes of this Division, see Subdivision 820G.

    * (4) For the purposes of paragraph (3)(a), treat treasury shares (within the meaning of *accounting standard AASB 132) in the entity as included in the *ADI equity capital of the entity, to the extent that those shares are part of the entity's eligible tier 1 capital (within the meaning of the *prudential standards).

##### 820305  Minimum capital amount

    * The entity's **_minimum capital amount_** for an income year is the least of the following amounts:

     * (a) the *safe harbour capital amount;

     * (b) the *arm's length capital amount;

     * (c) the *worldwide capital amount.

         * Note: The entity cannot use the worldwide capital amount if the entity is also a foreign controlled Australian entity throughout that year, see section 820320.

##### 820310  Safe harbour capital amount

    * (1) The **_safe harbour capital amount_** is the result of applying the method statement in this section. 

Method statement

       * Step 1.	Work out the average value, for the income year, of all the entity's:

         * (aa) *riskweighted assets; and

         * (ab) intangible assets comprising capitalised software expenses;

       * that are attributable to none of the following: 

         * (a) the entity's *overseas permanent establishments;

         * (b) assets comprised by the *controlled foreign entity equity of the entity (other than controlled foreign entity equity attributable to the entity's overseas permanent establishments);

         * (c) assets for which *prudential capital deductions must be made by the entity (other than prudential capital deductions attributable to the entity's overseas permanent establishments).

       * Step 2.	Multiply the result of step 1 by 6%.

       * Step 3.	Add to the result of step 2 the average value, for that year, of all the *tier 1 prudential capital deductions for the entity, to the extent that they are not attributable to:

         * (a) any of the entity's *overseas permanent establishments; or

         * (b) any *Australian controlled foreign entities of which the entity is an *Australian controller; or

         * (c) any of the entity's goodwill or intangible assets which relate to the excess mentioned in paragraph 5.3 of *accounting standard AASB 1038, as issued on 17 November 1998, to the extent that the excess is referrable to *VBIF; or

            * Note: Paragraph 5.3 of that accounting standard applies to any excess of the net market values of an interest in a subsidiary over the net amount of that subsidiary's assets and liabilities.

         * (d) any of the entity's intangible assets comprising capitalised software expenses.

       * The result of this step is the **_safe harbour capital amount_**.

         * Example: The Southern Cross Bank is an Australian bank that carries on its banking business through its overseas permanent establishments and through foreign entities that it controls. For the income year, its average value of riskweighted assets and intangible assets comprising capitalised software expenses is $150 million (having discounted those assets that are excluded by step 1) and the average value of its relevant tier 1 prudential capital deductions is $2 million. Multiplying $150 million by 6% equals $9 million, which is the result of step 2. Adding $2 million to $9 million equals $11 million, which is the safe harbour capital amount.

    * (2) **_VBIF_** is the value of business in force at the time of acquisition of the relevant subsidiary (within the meaning of paragraph 5.3 of *accounting standard AASB 1038, as issued on 17 November 1998) of the entity.

    * (3) *VBIF is taken to be nil at all times unless the value of VBIF at the time of acquisition of the relevant subsidiary was worked out by an *actuary according to Australian actuarial practice.

##### 820315  Arm's length capital amount

    * (1) The **_arm's length capital amount_** is a notional amount that, having regard to:

     * (a) the factual assumptions set out in subsection (2); and

     * (b) the relevant factors mentioned in subsection (3);

    * would represent the minimum amount of *equity capital that the entity would reasonably be expected to have in carrying on the Australian business mentioned in subsection (2) throughout the income year if, throughout that year:

     * (c) the part of the entity carrying on that business had operated as if it were a separate entity; and

     * (d) that separate entity had been dealing at *arm's length with:

       * (i) the other part of the entity; and

       * (ii) all the *Australian controlled foreign entities of which the entity is an *Australian controller.

         * Note: The entity must keep records in accordance with section 820980 if the entity works out an amount under this section.

    * Factual assumptions

    * (2) Irrespective of what actually happened during that year, the following assumptions must be made in working out that minimum amount:

     * (a) the entity's commercial activities in connection with  (the **_Australian business_**) during that year do not include:

       * (i) any *business carried on by the entity at or through its *overseas permanent establishments; or

       * (ii) the holding of any *controlled foreign entity equity;

     * (b) the entity had carried on the Australian business that it actually carried on during that year;

     * (c) the nature of the entity's assets and liabilities (to the extent that they are attributable to the Australian business) had been as they were during that year;

     * (d) except as mentioned in subsection (1), the entity had carried on the Australian business in the same circumstances as what actually existed during that year.

    * Relevant factors

    * (3) On the basis of the factual assumptions set out in subsection (2), the following factors must be taken into account in determining that minimum amount:

     * (a) the functions performed, the assets used, and the risks assumed, throughout that year, by:

       * (i) the entity; and

       * (ii) the entity in relation to the Australian business;

     * (b) the credit rating of the entity throughout that year, including the effect of that credit rating on all of the following:

       * (i) the entity's ability to borrow in relation to the Australian business;

       * (ii) the interest rate at which the entity borrowed in relation to that business;

       * (iii) the entity's gross profit margin in relation to that business;

     * (c) the capital ratios of the following throughout that year:

       * (i) the entity;

       * (ii) the entity in relation to the Australian business;

       * (iii) each of the entity's *associate entities that engage in commercial activities similar to the Australian business;

     * (d) the purposes for which *schemes for *debt capital and for *equity capital had been actually entered into, throughout that year, by:

       * (i) the entity; and

       * (ii) the entity in relation to the Australian business;

     * (e) the profit (within the meaning of the *accounting standards), and the return on capital, whether during that year or at any other time, of:

       * (i) the entity; and

       * (ii) the entity in relation to the Australian business;

     * (f) the commercial practices adopted by independent parties dealing with each other at *arm's length in the industry in which the entity carries on the Australian business throughout that year (whether in Australia or in comparable markets elsewhere);

     * (g) the way in which the entity financed its business (other than the Australian business) throughout that year;

     * (h) the general state of the Australian economy throughout that year;

     * (i) any other factors which are specified in the regulations made for the purposes of this section.

    * Commissioner's power

    * (4) If the Commissioner considers an amount worked out by the entity under this section does not appropriately take into account the factual assumptions and the relevant factors, the Commissioner may substitute another amount that the Commissioner considers better reflects those assumptions and factors.

##### 820320  Worldwide capital amount

    * (1) This section only applies if the entity is not also a *foreign controlled Australian entity throughout the income year.

    * (2) The **_worldwide capital amount_** is the result of applying the method statement in this subsection.

Method statement

       * Step 1.	Work out the average value, for the income year, of all the *riskweighted assets of the entity, other than riskweighted assets attributable to any of the following:

         * (a) the entity's *overseas permanent establishments;

         * (b) assets comprised by the *controlled foreign entity equity of the entity;

         * (c) assets for which *prudential capital deductions must be made by the entity.

       * Step 3.	Multiply the result of step 1 by the entity's worldwide group capital ratio for that year (see subsection (3)).

       * Step 4.	Add to the result of step 3 the average value, for that year, of all the *tier 1 prudential capital deductions for the entity (to the extent that they are not attributable to any of the entity's *overseas permanent establishments or to any *Australian controlled foreign entities of which the entity is an *Australian controller). The result of this step is the **_worldwide capital amount_**_._

         * _Example:	Southern Cross Bank has an average value of riskweighted assets of $150 million (having discounted those riskweighted assets that are excluded by step 1) and the average value of its relevant tier 1 prudential capital deductions is $2 million. The entity's worldwide group capital ratio is 0.0875. Multiplying $150 million by 0.0875 equals $13.125 million, which is the result of step 3. Adding that amount to the average value of the relevant tier 1 prudential capital deductions equals $15.125 million, which is the worldwide capital amount.

    * Worldwide group capital ratio

    * (3) The entity's **_worldwide group capital ratio_** for the income year is the result of applying the method statement in this subsection.

Method statement

       * Step 1.	Work out the average value, for the income year, of the tier 1 capital (within the meaning of the *prudential standards) of the consolidated group of which the entity is a member (within the meaning of those standards) in accordance with those standards.

       * Step 2.	Divide the result of step 1 by the average value, for that year, of the *riskweighted assets of that group in accordance with the *prudential standards. The result is the **_worldwide group capital ratio_**.

         * Example: For the Southern Cross Bank, the average value of the tier 1 capital for the relevant consolidated group is $14 million. Dividing $14 million by the group's risk weighted assets of $160 million equals 0.0875, which is the worldwide group capital ratio.

##### 820325  Amount of debt deduction disallowed

    * The amount of *debt deduction disallowed under subsection 820300(1) is worked out using the following formula:

    * where: 

    * **_average debt_** means the average value, for the income year, of all the *debt capital of the entity that gives rise to *debt deductions of the entity for that or any other income year (other than any debt capital that is attributable to any of the entity's *overseas permanent establishments).

    * **_capital shortfall _**means the amount by which the *adjusted average equity capital of the entity for that year (see subsection 820300(3)) is less than the entity's *minimum capital amount for that year.

    * **_debt deduction _**means each *debt deduction covered by subsection 820300(1).

         * Note: The disallowed amount also does not form part of the cost base of a CGT asset. See section 11054.

##### 820330  Application to part year periods

    * (1) This subsection disallows all or a part of each *debt deduction of an entity for an income year that is an amount incurred by the entity during a period that is a part of that year (to the extent that it is not attributable to an *overseas permanent establishment of the entity) if, for that period:

     * (a) the entity is an *outward investing entity (ADI); and

     * (b) the *adjusted average equity capital of the entity is less than the entity's *minimum capital amount.

         * Note: To determine whether an entity is an outward investing entity (nonADI) for that period, see subsection 820300(2).

    * (2) The entity's **_adjusted average equity capital_** for that period is:

     * (a) the average value, for that period, of all the *ADI equity capital of the entity (other than ADI equity capital attributable to any of its *overseas permanent establishments); minus

     * (b) the average value, for that period, of all the *controlled foreign entity equity of the entity (other than controlled foreign entity equity attributable to any of its overseas permanent establishments).

    * (3) For the purposes of determining:

     * (a) the entity's *minimum capital amount for that period; and

     * (b) the amount of each *debt deduction to be disallowed;

    * sections 820305 to 820325 apply in relation to that entity and that period with the modifications set out in the following table: 

##### Subdivision 820E--Thin capitalisation rules for inward investing entities (ADI)

##### Guide to Subdivision 820E

##### 820390  What this Subdivision is about

    * This Subdivision applies to a foreign entity that is an authorised deposittaking institution (an **_ADI_**). These rules deal with the following matters:

     *  	how to work out the entity's minimum capital amount for an income year;

     *  	how all or a part of the debt deductions claimed by the entity may be disallowed if the minimum capital amount is not reached;

     *  	how to apply these rules to a period that is less than an income year.

##### Operative provisions

##### 820395  Thin capitalisation rule for inward investing entities (ADI)

    * Thin capitalisation rule

    * (1) This subsection disallows all or a part of each *debt deduction of an entity for an income year if, for that year:

     * (a) the entity is an *inward investing entity (ADI) (see subsection (2)); and

     * (b) the entity's *average equity capital (see subsection (3)) is less than its *minimum capital amount (see section 820400);

    * to the extent that the debt deduction: 

     * (c) is attributable to an *Australian permanent establishment of the entity at or through which it carries on its banking business; and

     * (d) is not an *allowable  deduction.

         * Note 1: This Subdivision does not apply if the total debt deductions of that entity and all its associate entities for that year are $2 million or less, see section 82035.

         * Note 2: To work out the amount to be disallowed, see section 820415.

         * Note 3: For the rules that apply to an entity that is an inward investing entity (ADI) for part of an income year, see section 820420 in conjunction with subsection (2) of this section.

         * Note 4: A consolidated group or MEC group may be an inward investing entity (ADI) to which this Subdivision applies: see Subdivision 820FB.

    * Inward investing entity (ADI)

    * (2) The entity is an **_inward investing entity (ADI)_** for a period that is all or a part of an income year if, and only if, throughout that period, the entity is a *foreign bank that carries on its banking business in  at or through one or more of its *Australian permanent establishments.

         * Note: The entity is required to keep certain records, see Subdivision 820L.

    * Average equity capital

    * (3) The entity's **_average equity capital _**for an income year is the sum of the following:

     * (a) the average value, for that year, of the *ADI equity capital of the entity that:

       * (i) is attributable to the *Australian permanent establishments at or through which it carries on its banking business in ; but

       * (ii) has not been allocated to the *OB activities of the Australian permanent establishments;

     * (b) the average value, for that year, of the total amounts that:

       * (i) are made available by the entity to the Australian permanent establishments of the entity as loans to the Australian permanent establishments; and

       * (ii) do not give rise to any *debt deductions of the entity for that or any other income year.

         * Note: To calculate an average value for the purposes of this Division, see Subdivision 820G.

##### 820400  Minimum capital amount

    * The entity's **_minimum capital amount_** for an income year is the lesser of the following amounts:

     * (a) the *safe harbour capital amount;

     * (b) the *arm's length capital amount.

##### 820405  Safe harbour capital amount

    * The entity's **_safe harbour capital amount_** for the income year is the result of applying the method statement in this section.

Method statement

       * Step 1.	Work out the average value, for the income year, of that part of the *riskweighted assets of the entity that:

         * (a) is attributable to the *Australian permanent establishments at or through which it carries on its banking business in ; but

         * (b) is not attributable to the *OB activities of the Australian permanent establishments.

       * Step 2.	Multiply the result of step 1 by 6%. The result of this step is the **_safe harbour capital amount_**_._

         * _Example:	The Global Bank is a foreign bank that carries on its banking business in Australia through a permanent establishment. The average value of its relevant riskweighted assets is $140 million. Multiplying that amount by 6% results in $8.4 million, which is the safe harbour capital amount.

##### 820410  Arm's length capital amount

    * (1) The **_arm's length capital amount_** is a notional amount that, having regard to:

     * (a) the factual assumptions set out in subsection (2); and

     * (b) the relevant factors mentioned in subsection (3);

    * would represent the minimum amount of *equity capital that the entity would reasonably be expected to have in carrying on the Australian business mentioned in subsection (2) throughout the income year if, throughout that year:

     * (c) the part of the entity carrying on that business had operated as if it were a separate entity; and

     * (d) that separate entity had been dealing at *arm's length with the other part of the entity.

         * Note: The entity must keep records in accordance with section 820980 if the entity works out an amount under this section.

    * Relevant factors

    * (3) On the basis of the factual assumptions set out in subsection (2), the following factors must be taken into account in determining that minimum amount:

     * (a) the functions performed, the assets used, and the risks assumed, throughout that year, by:

     * (e) the profit (within the meaning of the *accounting standards or any other accounting standards that would otherwise apply to the entity), and the return on capital, whether during that year or at any other time, of:

       * (i) the entity; and

       * (ii) the entity in relation to the Australian business;

     * (f) the commercial practices adopted by independent parties dealing with each other at *arm's length in the industry in which the entity carries on the Australian business throughout that year (whether in Australia or in comparable markets elsewhere);

     * (g) the general state of the Australian economy throughout that year;

     * (h) any other factors which are specified in the regulations made for the purposes of this section.

    * **_capital shortfall _**means the amount by which the entity's *average equity capital for that year (see subsection 820395(3)) is less than the entity's *minimum capital amount for that year.

    * **_debt deduction _**means each *debt deduction of the entity (other than *allowable  deduction) for the income year.

         * Note: The disallowed amount also does not form part of the cost base of a CGT asset. See section 11054.

##### 820420  Application to part year periods

    * (1) This subsection disallows all or a part of each *debt deduction of an entity for an income year that is an amount incurred by the entity during a period that is a part of that year if, for that period:

     * (b) the entity's *average equity capital is less than its *minimum capital amount;

    * to the extent that the debt deduction: 

     * (c) is attributable to an *Australian permanent establishment of the entity at or through which it carries on its banking business; and

     * (d) is not an *allowable  deduction.

         * Note: To determine whether an entity is an inward investing entity (ADI) for that period, see subsection 820395(2).

       * (i) are made available by the entity to the Australian permanent establishments of the entity as loans to the Australian permanent establishments; and

       * (ii) do not give rise to any *debt deductions of the entity for that or any other income year.

    * (3) For the purposes of determining:

     * (a) the entity's *minimum capital amount for that period; and

     * (b) the amount of each *debt deduction to be disallowed;

    * sections 820400 to 820415 apply in relation to that entity and that period with the modifications set out in the following table:

    * (3) An entity satisfies this subsection for an income year if it satisfies subsection (2) and the amount worked out using this formula is greater than or equal to 0.8:

    * where: 

    * **_onlent amount_** means the average value, for that income year, of the entity's *onlent amount.

    * **_total assets_** means the average value, for that income year, of all the entity's assets.

    * **_UG on derivatives_** means the average value, for that income year, of the entity's assets consisting of unrealised gains on trading derivatives within the meaning of the _Corporations Act 2001_.

    * **_UL on derivatives_** means the lesser of:

     * (a) the average value, for that income year, of the entity's liabilities consisting of unrealised losses on trading derivatives within the meaning of the _Corporations Act 2001_; and

     * (b) the average value, for that income year, of the entity's assets consisting of unrealised gains on trading derivatives within the meaning of that Act.

    * Onlent amount increased for financial entity whose assets include precious metals

    * (4) In working out whether an entity satisfies subsection (1) or (3) for an income year, the average value, for that income year, of the entity's *onlent amount is increased by the average value, for that income year, of the entity's assets that consist of *precious metals, but only if the entity satisfies subsection (5) for that income year.

    * (5) An entity satisfies this subsection for an income year if the first period that is all or part of that income year, and for which the entity would be treated in accordance with a choice under section 820430, consists of one or more periods, each of which is either or both of these:

     * (a) a period throughout which the entity is a *financial entity;

     * (b) a period throughout which:

       * (i) the entity is the *head company of a *consolidated group or *MEC group; and

       * (ii) at least one *member of the group is a financial entity.

##### 820440  Revocation of choice

    * (1) A choice under section 820430 can be revoked only with the written approval of the Commissioner. The Commissioner may approve a revocation only if satisfied that the entity's circumstances have changed significantly since the choice was made.

    * (2) If revoked, the choice does not have effect for a period that starts on or after the day on which the Commissioner's approval is given, unless the revocation is expressed to take effect on an earlier day. In that case, it does not have effect for a period that starts on or after the earlier day.

##### 820445  How this Subdivision interacts with Subdivision 820FA

    * A choice under section 820430 does not have effect for so much of a period as happens while the entity is a *subsidiary member of a *consolidated group or *MEC group.

         * Note: If the head company of the group makes a choice under that section, that choice will have effect instead.

##### Operative provisions

##### 820581  How this Division applies to head company for income year in which group comes into existence or ceases to exist

    * If a *consolidated group or *MEC group:

     * (a) comes into existence at a time during an income year that is not the start of the income year; or

     * (b) ceases to exist at a time during an income year that is not the end of the income year;

    * then, for each of the following periods during that income year:

     * (c) a period throughout which a company is the *head company of that group; or

     * (d) a period throughout which that company is the head company of a different consolidated group or MEC group; or

     * (e) a period throughout which that company is a *member of no consolidated group or MEC group;

    * this Division (except this section) is to have either:

     * (f) a single application in relation to the whole of the period; or

     * (g) 2 or more applications, each in relation to a part of that period.

         * Example: Austco Ltd is not a member of a consolidated group for the first 6 months of an income year, but then becomes the head company of a consolidated group which continues in existence for the rest of the income year.

         * For those first 6 months Austco is an outward investor (general) under section 82085. For the rest of the income year Austco is an outward investor (general) under subsection 820583(2).

         * This section ensures that section 820120 (about part year periods) applies to Austco instead of section 82085, so that Subdivision 820B has 2 separate applications to Austco: one for the first 6 months and the other for the rest of the income year. Under the second application, account is taken of the position of the subsidiary members that are taken to be part of Austco as head company of the consolidated group.

##### 820583  Classification of head company

    * Outward investing entity (nonADI)

    * (1) The *head company of a *consolidated group or of a *MEC group is an **_outward investing entity (nonADI)_** for a period that is all or part of an income year if, and only if, it is:

     * (a) an *outward investor (general) for that period (because of subsection (2)); or

     * (b) an *outward investor (financial) for that period (because of subsection (3)).

    * Outward investor (general)

    * (2) The *head company of a *consolidated group or of a *MEC group is an **_outward investor (general)_** for a period that is all or part of an income year if:

     * (a) for that period, the head company satisfies the condition in the second column of item 1 or 3 of the table in subsection 82085(2); and

     * (b) no *member of the group is a *financial entity or *ADI at any time during that period.

    * Outward investor (financial)

    * (3) The *head company of a *consolidated group or of a *MEC group is an **_outward investor (financial)_** for a period that is all or part of an income year if:

     * (a) for that period, the head company satisfies the condition in the second column of item 1 or 3 of the table in subsection 82085(2); and

     * (b) throughout that period, there is at least one *member of the group that is a *financial entity; and

     * (c) no *member of the group is an *ADI at any time during that period.

    * Inward investing entity (nonADI)

    * (4) The *head company of a *consolidated group or of a *MEC group is an **_inward investing entity (nonADI)_** for a period that is all or part of an income year if, and only if, it is:

     * (a) an *inward investment vehicle (general) for that period (because of subsection (5)); or

     * (b) an *inward investment vehicle (financial) for that period (because of subsection (6)).

    * Inward investment vehicle (general)

    * (5) The *head company of a *consolidated group or of a *MEC group is an **_inward investment vehicle (general)_** for a period that is all or part of an income year if:

     * (a) throughout that period, the head company is a *foreign controlled Australian entity; and

     * (b) no member of the group is a *financial entity or *ADI at any time during that period;

    * unless the head company is an *outward investing entity (nonADI) for all or part of that period.

    * Inward investment vehicle (financial)

    * (6) The *head company of a *consolidated group or of a *MEC group is an **_inward investment vehicle (financial)_** for a period that is all or part of an income year if:

     * (a) throughout that period, the head company is a *foreign controlled Australian entity; and

     * (b) throughout that period, there is at least one *member of the group that is a *financial entity; and

     * (c) no member of the group is an *ADI at any time during that period;

    * unless the head company is an *outward investing entity (nonADI) for all or part of that period.

    * Outward investing entity (ADI)

    * (7) The *head company of a *consolidated group or of a *MEC group is an **_outward investing entity (ADI)_** for a period that is all or part of an income year if, and only if:

     * (a) apart from Part 390 (about consolidation of groups) and this Subdivision, at least one *member of the group would be an *outward investing entity (ADI) for that period; or

     * (b) these conditions are met:

       * (i) at least one member of the group would, apart from that Part and this Subdivision, be an *outward investing entity (nonADI) for that period; and

       * (ii) at least one member of the group is an *ADI throughout that period.

##### 820584  Exempt special purpose entities treated as not being member of group

    * While an entity meets the conditions in subsection 82039(3) (about insolvencyremote special purpose entities established to manage economic risk), the entity is treated for the purposes of this Division (except this section) as _not_ being a *member of a *consolidated group or *MEC group of which it is a member.

         * Note: This section has the effect that the circumstances of the entity are not taken into account in applying this Division to the head company of the group. The entity itself is exempt from this Division because of section 82039.

##### 820585  Exemption for consolidated group headed by foreigncontrolled Australian ADI or its holding company

    * (1) This Division does not disallow any of a *debt deduction for an income year if:

     * (a) the debt deduction is of the *head company of a *consolidated group and the head company satisfies subsection (2) for that income year; or

     * (b) the debt deduction is an amount incurred by the head company of a consolidated group during a period that is part of that income year, and the head company satisfies subsection (2) for that period.

    * (2) The *head company satisfies this subsection for a period that is all or part of an income year if, throughout that period:

     * (a) the head company is both a *foreign controlled Australian company and an *ADI (and would also be an ADI apart from Part 390 (about consolidation of groups)); or

     * (b) the head company:

       * (i) is a *foreign controlled Australian company; and

       * (ii) beneficially owns all the *membership interests in a *member of the group that is both a *foreign controlled Australian entity and an *ADI throughout that period; and

       * (iii) would, apart from Part 390 (about consolidation of groups), have no other assets and no *debt capital;

    * unless at least one member of the group would, apart from that Part and this Subdivision, be an *outward investing entity (nonADI) or *outward investing entity (ADI) for all or part of that period.

    * (3) Subsection (1) does not apply if, at each time in the period mentioned in subsection (2), all the *ADIs that are *members of the group then are *specialist credit card institutions.

##### 820587  Additional application of Subdivision 820D to MEC group that includes foreigncontrolled Australian ADI

    * Subdivision 820D applies to the *head company of a *MEC group as if it were an *outward investing entity (ADI) for a period that is all or part of an income year if:

     * (a) the head company is _not_ an outward investing entity (ADI) for that period; and

     * (b) throughout that period, at least one *member of the group is both a *foreign controlled Australian entity and an *ADI; and

     * (c) throughout that period, there is at least one *eligible tier1 company of the *top company for the group that:

       * (i) is a member of the group; and

       * (ii) is _not_ an ADI; and

       * (iii) has no *whollyowned subsidiary that is an ADI.

##### 820588  Choice to treat specialist credit card institutions as being financial entities and not ADIs

    * (1) If the conditions in subsection (2) are met in relation to a *consolidated group or *MEC group and a period that is all or part of an income year, this Division (except this section) has effect as if:

     * (a) none of the *members of the group were an *ADI at any time in the period; and

     * (b) each member of the group that is an ADI (ignoring paragraph (a)) at any time in the period were a financial entity at that time.

         * Note 1: One result of this Division having effect in that way is that Subdivision 820D (and related provisions, such as section 820589) will not apply in relation to the head company, because:

          * (a) the head company of the group will not be classified under section 820583 as an outward investing entity (ADI); and

          * (b) section 820587 will not apply that Subdivision.

         * Note 2: Another result of this Division having effect in that way is that Subdivision 820B or 820C may apply in relation to the head company, because it may be classified under section 820583 as either:

          * (a) an outward investing entity (nonADI) and an outward investor (financial); or

          * (b) an inward investing entity (nonADI) and an inward investment vehicle (financial).

    * (2) The conditions are that:

     * (a) at all times in the period at least one *member of the *consolidated group or *MEC group is an *ADI; and

     * (b) each ADI that is a member of the group at any time in the period is a *specialist credit card institution at that time; and

     * (c) the *head company of the group for the period chooses, before lodging its *income tax return for the income year, that this Division should have effect in that way in relation to the group and every period for which the conditions in paragraphs (a) and (b) are met in the income year.

    * (3) An *ADI is a **_specialist credit card institution_** at a time if, at that time, the ADI's authority under section 9 of the _Banking Act 1959_ to carry on banking business (as defined in that Act) authorises the ADI to carry on only banking business that:

     * (a) is participation in a payment system (as defined in the _Payment Systems (Regulation) Act 1998_) that is a credit card scheme and is designated under section 11 of that Act; and

     * (b) is either or both of the following:

       * (i) credit card acquiring (as defined in regulations made for the purposes of the _Banking Act 1959_);

       * (ii) credit card issuing (as defined in those regulations).

    * (4) To avoid doubt, a choice for the purposes of paragraph (2)(c) cannot be revoked.

##### 820589  How Subdivision 820D applies to a MEC group

    * (1) This section has effect for the purposes of working out the *adjusted average equity capital of the *head company of a *MEC group for a period (the **_test period_**) that is all or part of an income year if Subdivision 820D applies to the head company in relation to that period.

         * Note: Section 820587 extends the application of Subdivision 820D.

    * (2) The *head company's *ADI equity capital at a particular time during the test period is to be worked out:

     * (a) taking into account an *equity interest or *debt interest in the head company only if it is held at that time by an entity that is _not_ a member of the group; and

     * (b) on the basis that an equity interest or debt interest in an *eligible tier1 company (other than the head company) that is a member of the group at that time is treated as an equity interest or debt interest (as appropriate) in the head company, but only if it is held at that time by an entity that is _not_ a member of the group; and

     * (c) on the basis of the information that would be contained in a set of consolidated accounts:

       * (i) prepared, in accordance with the *accounting standard on consolidated accounts, as at that time; and

       * (ii) covering the members of the group as at that time.

##### Guide to Subdivision 820FB

##### 820595  What this Subdivision is about

    * If: 

         * (a) the head company of a consolidated group or MEC group; or

         * (b) an Australian company that cannot consolidate;

    * is a member of the same whollyowned group as a foreign bank or foreign financial entity, the company can choose to treat as part of itself the Australian branches of the foreign bank or foreign financial entity, affecting how the rest of this Division applies.

##### Choice to group with branches of foreign banks and foreign financial entities

##### 820597  Choice by head company of consolidated group or MEC group

    * (1) This section applies if there is a period (the **_grouping period_**) for which all these conditions are met:

     * (a) the period was all or part of an income year of the *head company of a *consolidated group or *MEC group;

     * (b) the consolidated group or MEC group existed throughout the period;

     * (c) the head company and an entity (the **_establishment entity_**) covered by one of the following subparagraphs are both members of the same *whollyowned group throughout the period:

       * (i) a *foreign bank that carried on its banking *business in  through at least one *Australian permanent establishment at each time in the period;

       * (ii) a *foreign entity that was a *financial entity and had at least one Australian permanent establishment at each time in the period;

     * (d) there is not a longer period in the income year for which the conditions in paragraphs (a), (b) and (c) are met in relation to the head company and the establishment entity.

         * Note: It does not matter whether the income year ended on the same day for the head company and the establishment entity.

    * (2) The *head company may choose to have all of the *Australian permanent establishments of the establishment entity treated as part of the head company for the grouping period for the purposes of this Division.

    * (3) If the conditions in subsection (1) are met in relation to the *head company and more than one other establishment entity, the head company may make a different choice in relation to each of the other establishment entities.

##### 820599  Choice by Australian resident company outside consolidatable group and MEC group

    * (1) This section applies if there is a period (also the **_grouping period_**) for which all these conditions are met:

     * (a) the period was all or part of an income year of a company (the **_single company_**);

     * (b) throughout the period the single company:

       * (i) was an *Australian entity; and

       * (ii) was not a *prescribed dual resident; and

       * (iii) was not a *member of a *consolidatable group; and

       * (iv) was not a member of a *consolidated group; and

       * (v) was not a member of a *MEC group;

     * (c) the single company and an entity (the **_establishment entity_**) covered by one of the following subparagraphs are both members of the same *whollyowned group throughout the period:

       * (i) a *foreign bank that carried on its banking *business in  through at least one *Australian permanent establishment at each time in the period;

       * (ii) a *foreign entity that was a *financial entity and had at least one Australian permanent establishment at each time in the period;

     * (d) there is not a longer period in the income year for which the conditions in paragraphs (a), (b) and (c) are met in relation to the single company and the establishment entity.

         * Note: It does not matter whether the income year ended on the same day for the single company and the establishment entity.

    * (2) The single company may choose to have all of the *Australian permanent establishments of the establishment entity treated as part of the single company for the grouping period for the purposes of this Division.

    * (3) If the conditions in subsection (1) are met in relation to the single company and more than one other establishment entity, the single company may make a different choice in relation to each of the other establishment entities.

##### Effect of choice

##### 820601  Application

    * Sections 820603 to 820615 apply if a choice is made under section 820597 or 820599.

##### 820603  General

    * (1) The choice cannot be revoked in relation to the grouping period. It binds the *head company or the single company, as appropriate, and the establishment entity.

    * (2) The rest of this section applies:

     * (a) to each *Australian permanent establishment that:

       * (i) was an Australian permanent establishment of the establishment entity; and

       * (ii) if the establishment entity was a *foreign bank--was an Australian permanent establishment through which the entity carried on banking *business in  at any time in the grouping period; and

     * (b) in relation to each time (the **_test time_**) that was in the grouping period and was when the Australian permanent establishment:

       * (i) was an Australian permanent establishment of the establishment entity; and

       * (ii) if the establishment entity was a foreign bank--was an Australian permanent establishment through which the entity carried on banking business in .

    * (3) In the case of a choice under section 820597, this Division (except Subdivision 820FA, this Subdivision and Subdivision 820L) applies as if, at the test time, the *Australian permanent establishment:

     * (a) had been part of the *head company; and

     * (b) had _not_ been part of the establishment entity; and

     * (c) were a *subsidiary member of the *consolidated group or *MEC group.

    * (4) In the case of a choice under section 820599, this Division (except Subdivision 820FA, this Subdivision and Subdivision 820L) applies as if, at the test time:

     * (a) the *Australian permanent establishment had been part of the single company and had _not_ been part of the establishment entity; and

     * (b) the single company were a *consolidated group of which the single company was the *head company and the Australian permanent establishment was a *subsidiary member.

    * (5) In either case, without limiting subsection (3) or (4), this Division (except Subdivision 820FA, this Subdivision and Subdivision 820L) applies as if:

     * (a) the *Australian permanent establishment were an entity at that time; and

     * (b) each asset and liability of the establishment entity at the test time that is attributable to the Australian permanent establishment were an asset or liability of the Australian permanent establishment at that time; and

     * (c) without limiting paragraph (b) of this subsection, each cost that:

       * (i) is a *debt deduction of the establishment entity incurred at the test time; and

       * (ii) is attributable to the Australian permanent establishment;

     * were a cost incurred by the Australian permanent establishment at that time;

         * For the effects of disallowing debt deductions, see section 820605.

    * (6) However, the application of this Division because of this section is subject to the modifications set out in sections 820607 to 820615.

    * (7) For the purposes of this Division (as applying because of this Subdivision), this Act (except this Division) applies as if the matters referred to in subsections (3), (4) and (5) of this section were the case.

         * Note: For example, this means that a head company is treated for the purposes of this Division as if it had debt deductions based on the actual costs incurred by an Australian permanent establishment while it is treated as part of the head company because of this section.

##### 820605  Effect on establishment entity if certain debt deductions disallowed

    * If: 

     * (a) apart from this Division, a *debt deduction would be a deduction of the establishment entity for an income year; and

     * (b) this Division (as applying because of this Subdivision) disallows all or part of the deduction (treated as a deduction of the *head company or single company);

    * this section disallows the deduction of the establishment entity, or that part of it, as appropriate.

         * Note 1A: The disallowed amount also does not form part of the cost base of a CGT asset. See section 11054.

         * Note 1: This Division does not disallow a debt deduction that the establishment entity incurs during the grouping period and that consists of a cost that is:

          *  	attributable to an Australian permanent establishment covered by the choice under section 820597 or 820599; and

          *  	paid or owed to the head company or single company.

         * The cost is not a debt deduction of the head company or single company for the purposes of this Division as applying because of this Subdivision. This is because subsection 820603(3) or (4) treats the Australian permanent establishment as being part of the head company or single company, so the cost is treated as being paid or owed by the head company or single company to itself.

         * Because subsection 820603(3) or (4) also treats the Australian permanent establishment as not being part of the establishment entity, the cost is not a debt deduction of the establishment entity, so it is not disallowed by this Division as applying to the establishment entity.

         * Note 2: This Division also does not disallow a debt deduction that the head company or single company incurs during the grouping period and that consists of a cost that is:

          *  	paid or owed to the establishment entity; and

          *  	is attributable to an Australian permanent establishment covered by the choice under section 820597 or 820599.

         * The cost is not a debt deduction of the head company or single company for the purposes of this Division as applying because of this Subdivision. This is because subsection 820603(3) or (4) treats the Australian permanent establishment as being part of the head company or single company, so the cost is treated as being paid or owed by the head company or single company to itself.

##### 820607  Effect on test periods under this Division

    * If, apart from this section, this Division (except this Subdivision) would have a single application to the *head company or single company, or to the establishment entity, in relation to a period (the **_test period_**) that:

     * (a) is all or part of an income year of that entity; and

     * (b) overlaps the grouping period;

    * this Division (except this section) is to have separate applications to that entity as follows:

     * (c) a single application in relation to the period of overlap; and

     * (d) a single application in relation to the part (if any) of the test period that is before the period of overlap; and

     * (e) a single application in relation to the part (if any) of the test period that is after the period of overlap.

##### 820609  Effect on classification of head company or single company

    * (1) The *head company or single company is an **_outward investing entity (ADI)_** for a period (the **_trial period_**) that is all or part of the grouping period if:

     * (a) apart from this Subdivision, the head company or single company would be an *outward investing entity (ADI) for the trial period; or

     * (b) apart from this Subdivision, the head company or single company would be:

       * (i) an *outward investing entity (nonADI) and an *outward investor (financial) for the trial period; or

       * (ii) an *outward investing entity (nonADI) and an *outward investor (general) for the trial period;

     * and at least one of the *Australian permanent establishments is a *permanent establishment through which a *foreign bank carries on banking *business in .

    * (2) The *head company is also an **_outward investing entity (ADI)_** for the trial period if, apart from this Subdivision:

     * (a) section 820585 would prevent the disallowance of a *debt deduction for the income year including the trial period; or

     * (b) section 820587 would apply Subdivision 820D to the head company as if it were an *outward investing entity (ADI) for the trial period.

    * (3) The single company is also an **_outward investing entity (ADI)_** for the trial period if it is both a *foreign controlled Australian company and an *ADI for that period.

    * (4) The *head company or single company is an **_inward investing entity (ADI)_** for the trial period if:

     * (a) apart from this Subdivision, it would be an *inward investment vehicle (general) or an *inward investment vehicle (financial), and not an *outward investor (general) or an *outward investor (financial), for the trial period; and

     * (b) at least one of the *Australian permanent establishments is a *permanent establishment through which a *foreign bank carries on banking *business in .

    * (5) The *head company or single company is an **_outward investing entity (nonADI)_** and an **_outward investor (financial)_** for the trial period if, apart from this Subdivision, it would be an *outward investing entity (nonADI) and:

     * (a) an *outward investor (financial); or

     * (b) an *outward investor (general);

    * for that period, and:

     * (c) at least one of the *Australian permanent establishments is a *permanent establishment of a *foreign entity that is a *financial entity; and

     * (d) none of the Australian permanent establishments is a permanent establishment through which a *foreign bank carries on banking *business in .

    * (6) The *head company or single company is an **_inward investing entity (nonADI)_** and an **_inward investment vehicle (financial)_** for the trial period if, apart from this Subdivision, it would be an *inward investing entity (nonADI) and:

     * (a) an *inward investment vehicle (financial); or

     * (b) an *inward investment vehicle (general);

    * for that period and not an *outward investor (general) or an *outward investor (financial) for that period and:

     * (c) at least one of the *Australian permanent establishments is a *permanent establishment of a *foreign entity that is a *financial entity; and

     * (d) none of the Australian permanent establishments is a permanent establishment through which a *foreign bank carries on banking *business in .

    * (7) This section has effect despite any other provision of this Division, except Subdivision 820EA and section 820610.

         * Note: If the head company or single company is an outward investor (financial) or inward investment vehicle (financial) under this section and satisfies subsection 820430(5), it may choose under Subdivision 820EA to be treated as an outward investing entity (ADI). Section 820603 affects whether the company satisfies that subsection, by treating as part of the company each relevant foreign financial entity's Australian permanent establishment.

##### 820610  Choice not to be outward investing entity (ADI) or inward investing entity (ADI)

    * (1) This section applies if:

     * (a) apart from this section, the *head company or single company would, under section 820609, be an *outward investing entity (ADI) or an *inward investing entity (ADI) for the trial period; and

     * (b) at all times in the trial period, each of the following entities that is an *ADI is a *specialist credit card institution:

       * (i) the head company or single company;

       * (ii) an establishment entity whose *Australian permanent establishments the head company or single company has chosen under section 820597 or 820599 to have treated as part of the company for the period.

    * (2) The *head company or single company is an **_outward investing entity (nonADI)_** and an **_outward investor (financial)_** for the trial period if:

     * (a) apart from this section, the company would, under section 820609, be an *outward investing entity (ADI) for the trial period; and

     * (b) the company chooses, before lodging its *income tax return for the income year including the trial period, to be an outward investing entity (nonADI) and an outward investor (financial) for that period.

    * (3) The *head company or single company is an **_inward investing entity (nonADI)_** and an **_inward investment vehicle (financial)_** for the trial period if:

     * (a) apart from this section, the company would, under section 820609, be an *inward investing entity (ADI) for the trial period; and

     * (b) the company chooses, before lodging its *income tax return for the income year including the trial period, to be an inward investing entity (nonADI) and an inward investment vehicle (financial) for that period.

    * (4) This section has effect despite sections 82085, 820185 and 820609.

##### 820611  Values to be based on what would be in consolidated accounts for group

    * (1) For the purposes of this Division as applying because of this Subdivision, the value or amount of a particular matter as at a particular time during the grouping period is to be worked out, so far as practicable, on the basis of the information that would be contained in a set of consolidated accounts:

     * (a) prepared, in accordance with the *accounting standard on consolidated accounts, as at that time; and

     * (b) covering the *consolidated group, *MEC group or single company, as appropriate, and each *Australian permanent establishment that section 820603 treats as part of the *head company or single company at that time.

         * Note: This subsection does not depend on whether such a set of consolidated accounts was prepared, or had to be prepared, for other purposes.

    * (2) To avoid doubt, subsection (1) also applies to working out the value or amount, as at a particular time, of a matter mentioned in any of sections 820613 to 820615.

##### 820613  How Subdivision 820D applies

    * (1) This section has effect for the purposes of applying Subdivision 820D to the *head company or single company in relation to a period (the **_test period_**) that is all or part of the grouping period.

         * Note: Subdivision 820D applies to the head company or single company if it is classified as an outward investing entity (ADI) because of section 820609, either alone or in conjunction with a choice made by the company under section 820430.

    * Adjusted average equity capital

    * (2) The *adjusted average equity capital of the *head company or single company for the test period is increased by the average value, for the period, of the amount worked out under subsection (3).

         * Note 1: In the case of a choice under section 820599, paragraph 820603(4)(b) treats the single company and the relevant Australian permanent establishments as a consolidated group.

         * Note 2: To calculate an average value for the purposes of this Division, see Subdivision 820G.

    * (3) The amount worked out under this subsection as at a particular day is the total of the amounts worked out under the following paragraphs for each of the establishment entity's *Australian permanent establishments that section 820603 treats as part of the *head company or single company on that day:

     * (a) so much of the establishment entity's *ADI equity capital, at the end of the day, as:

       * (i) is attributable to that Australian permanent establishment; and

       * (ii) has not been allocated to the *OB activities of the entity;

     * (b) the amounts that, as at the end of that day:

       * (i) are made available by the establishment entity to the Australian permanent establishment as loans to it; and

       * (ii) do not give rise to any *debt deductions of the entity for the income year or any other income year.

         * Note: The amounts are to be worked out, so far as practicable, on the basis of the information that would be contained in a set of consolidated accounts. See section 820611.

    * Riskweighted assets

    * (4) For each of the establishment entity's *Australian permanent establishments that is covered by the choice, the *riskweighted assets of the *head company or single company include that part of the entity's riskweighted assets that:

         * Note: Subdivision 820E applies to the head company or single company if it is classified as an inward investing entity (ADI) because of section 820609.

    * Average equity capital

    * (2) The **_average equity capital _**of the *head company or single company for the test period is:

     * (a) the average value, for that period, of all the *ADI equity capital of the company; plus

     * (b) the average value, for that period, of the amount worked out under subsection 820613(3).

         * Note 1: In the case of a choice under section 820599, paragraph 820603(4)(b) treats the single company and the relevant Australian permanent establishments as a consolidated group.

         * Note 2: To calculate an average value for the purposes of this Division, see Subdivision 820G.

    * Safe harbour capital amount

    * (3) The **_safe harbour capital amount_** of the *head company or single company for the test period is worked out using the following method statement.

Method statement

       * Step 1.	Work out the average value, for the test period, of the *head company's or single company's *riskweighted assets.

       * Step 2.	Multiply the result of step 1 by 6%. The result of this step is the **_safe harbour capital amount_**.

    * Riskweighted assets

    * (4) For each of the establishment entity's *Australian permanent establishments covered by the choice, the *riskweighted assets of the *head company or single company include that part of the entity's riskweighted assets that:

##### How to calculate the average values

##### 820630  Methods of calculating average values

    * Methods of calculation for entities that are not ADIs

    * (1) An entity to which Subdivision 820B or 820C applies for a period that is all or a part of an income year must use one of the following methods to calculate the average value of a matter mentioned in that Subdivision for the purposes of that application:

     * (a) the method set out in section 820635 (the **_opening and closing balances method_**);

     * (b) the method set out in section 820640 (the **_3 measurement days method_**);

     * (c) the method set out in section 820645 (the **_frequent measurement method_**).

         * Note 1: This subsection therefore applies only to an outward investing entity (nonADI) or an inward investing entity (nonADI).

         * Note 2: An entity cannot apply the 3 measurement days method if it is unable to meet the requirements in subsection 820640(1). An entity's ability to apply that method may therefore be limited.

    * (2) The entity must use the same method to calculate all such average values for that period for the purposes of that application.

    * Commissioner's power

    * (3) If the entity fails to comply with subsection (2), the Commissioner may, irrespective of the methods used by the entity, recalculate all the average values for the entity and that period by using the opening and closing balances method.

    * Method of calculation for ADIs

    * (4) An entity to which Subdivision 820D or 820E applies for a period that is all or a part of an income year must use the frequent measurement method to calculate the average value of a matter mentioned in that Subdivision for the purposes of that application.

         * Note: This subsection therefore applies only to an outward investing entity (ADI) or an inward investing entity (ADI).

##### 820635  The opening and closing balances method

    * An entity that uses the opening and closing balances method for a period must apply the following method statement to calculate the average value of a matter for that period.

       * _Method statement_

       * _Step 1.	Work out the value of the particular matter as at the first day of that period_._

       * _Step 2.	Work out the value of the particular matter as at the last day of that period.

       * Step 3.	Add the results of steps 1 and 2.

       * Step 4.	Divide the result of step 3 by 2. The result of this step is the average value.

         * Example: ALWZ Corporation, a company that is an Australian entity, held assets valued at $95 million on the first day of an income year. It held assets valued at $105 million at the end of that year. Adding those amounts and dividing the result by 2 gives the average value of its assets for that year, which is $100 million.

##### 820640  The 3 measurement days method

    * Application

    * (1) An entity must not use the 3 measurement days method for a period that is a part of an income year unless the following days occur during that period:

     * (a) the last day of the first half of the income year;

     * (b) one or both of the following days:

       * (i) the first day of that year;

       * (ii) the last day of that year.

    * Method statement

    * (2) An entity that uses the 3 measurement days method for a period must apply the following method statement to calculate the average value of a matter for that period.

Method statement

       * Step 1.	Work out the value of the particular matter as at the first measurement day (see subsection (3)).

       * Step 2.	Work out the value of the particular matter as at the second measurement day (see subsection (3)).

       * Step 3.	Work out the value of the particular matter as at the third measurement day (see subsection (3)).

       * Step 4.	Add the results of steps 1, 2 and 3.

       * Step 5.	Divide the result of step 4 by 3. The result of this step is the average value.

         * Example: RJ Corporation held assets valued at $115 million on the first day of an income year. It held assets valued at $105 million on the last day of the first half of that year, and $80 million on the last day of that year. Adding these amounts and dividing the result by 3 gives the average value of its assets for that year, which is $100 million.

    * Measurement days

    * (3) The following are the **_first_**, **_second_** and **_third measurement days_**:

     * (a) the **_first measurement day_** is the first day of the income year if it occurs during that period, otherwise it is the first day of that period;

     * (b) the **_second measurement day_** is the last day of the first half of that year;

     * (c) the **_third measurement day_** is the last day of that year if it occurs during that period, otherwise it is the last day of that period.

##### 820645  The frequent measurement method

    * (1) An entity that uses the frequent measurement method for a period (the **_measurement period_**) must calculate the average value of a matter for that period by applying:

     * (a) the method statement in subsection (2) (generally based on quarterly periods); or

     * (b) the method statement in subsection (4) (generally based on regular intervals).

    * This section does not prevent the entity from applying the method statement in subsection (2) for one matter and the method statement in subsection (4) for another matter in relation to that period.

    * (2) This is the method statement for the purposes of paragraph (1)(a).

Method statement

       * Step 1.	Work out the value of the particular matter as at each of the following measurement days:

         * (a) the first day of the measurement period;

         * (b) the last day of each quarterly period of that income year (see subsection (3)) that occurs during the measurement period (if any);

         * (c) the last day of the measurement period if it is not a day covered by paragraph (b).

       * Step 2.	Add up those values.

       * Step 3.	Divide the result of step 2 by the number of measurement days. The result of this step is the average value.

         * Example: KJW Finance Corporation, a company that is an Australian entity, held assets valued at $130 million on the first day of an income year. On the last day of each quarterly period for that year it held assets valued at $140 million, $120 million, $110 million and $100 million respectively. Adding these amounts and dividing the result by 5 gives the average value of its assets for that year, which is $120 million.

    * Quarterly period

    * (3) The **_quarterly periods of the income year_** are:

     * (a) the period consisting of the first, second and third months of that year; and

     * (b) each successive period of 3 months that occurs after that period during that year.

    * (4) This is the method statement for the purposes of paragraph (1)(b):

Method statement

       * Step 1.	Work out the value of the particular matter as at each of the following measurement days:

         * (a) the first day of the measurement period;

         * (b) the last day of each regular interval for the measurement period (see subsection (5));

         * (c) the last day of the measurement period if it is not a day mentioned in paragraph (b).

       * Step 2.	Add up those values.

       * Step 3.	Divide the result of step 2 by the number of measurement days. The result of this step is the average value.

         * Example: TW Corporation, a company that is an Australian entity, adopts a weekly interval for the purposes of this subsection. The measurement period is a period of 12 weeks. On the first day of that period it had $70 million of debt capital. Its debt capital was $80 million on the last day of each of the first 7 weeks, and $95 million on the last day of the remaining 5 weeks. Adding these amounts and dividing the result by 13 (the number of measurement days) gives the average value of its debt capital for that period, which is $85 million.

    * Regular intervals

    * (5) The **_regular intervals_** for the measurement period are:

     * (a) a period which consists of a fixed number of days or months (not less than one day and not more than 3 months) adopted by the entity and begins at the start of the first day of the measurement period; and

     * (b) each successive period of the same duration that occurs during the measurement period.

         * Note: Examples of a regular interval therefore include a daily, weekly, fortnightly, monthly or quarterly interval.

    * (6) The entity must use the same regular intervals when calculating the average values of different matters under subsection (4) for that period.

##### Special rules about values and valuation

##### 820675  Amount to be expressed in Australian currency

    * (1) For the purposes of this Division, an amount (including a value used in a calculation under this Division) is to be expressed in Australian currency.

    * (2) An entity must comply with the *accounting standards in converting an amount into Australian currency.

    * (3) Subsection (2) has effect whether the *accounting standard would otherwise apply to the entity or not.

##### 820680  Valuation of assets, liabilities and equity capital

    * (1) For the purposes of this Division, an entity must comply with the *accounting standards in determining what are its assets and liabilities and in calculating:

     * (a) the value of its assets (including revaluing its assets for the purposes of that calculation); and

     * (b) the value of its liabilities (including its *debt capital); and

     * (c) the value of its *equity capital.

         * Note: This requirement to comply with the accounting standards is modified in certain cases (see sections 820310, 820682, 820683 and 820684).

    * (1A) In particular, for the purposes of this Division, the entity has an asset or liability at a particular time if, and only if, according to the *accounting standards, the asset or liability can or must be recognised at that time.

         * Note: This application of the accounting standards is modified in certain cases (see sections 820682 and 820683).

    * Requirements for revaluation of assets

    * (2) A revaluation of assets mentioned in paragraph (1)(a) must be made by a person:

     * (a) who is an expert in valuing such assets; and

     * (b) whose pecuniary or other interests could not reasonably be regarded as being capable of affecting the person's ability to give an unbiased opinion in relation to that revaluation.

         * Note 1: The entity must also keep records in accordance with section 820985 about the revaluation, unless the exception in subsection (2A) of this section applies.

         * Note 2: This subsection also applies to some revaluations that are not allowed by the accounting standards (see subsection 820684(5)).

    * Revaluation reflected in statutory financial statements for the same period

    * (2A) A revaluation of an asset need not comply with subsection (2) if:

     * (a) the revaluation is for the purpose of the entity calculating the value of its assets for the purposes of this Division as applying to the entity for a particular period; and

     * (b) the entity is required by an Australian law to prepare financial statements for a period that is or includes all or part of that period; and

     * (c) those financial statements reflect the revaluation.

    * External validation of a revaluation made internally

    * (2B) A revaluation of assets mentioned in paragraph (1)(a) may be made by a person (the **_internal expert_**) if:

     * (a) apart from this subsection, paragraph (2)(b) would prevent the internal expert from making the revaluation, but only because, in making it, he or she would be:

       * (i) performing duties as an employee of the entity; or

       * (ii) providing services under an *arrangement with the entity that is substantially similar to a contract of employment; and

     * (b) another person (the **_external expert_**):

       * (i) is not prevented by subsection (2) from making the revaluation; and

       * (ii) has reviewed the methodology for making it (including the validity of any assumptions to be made, and the accuracy and reliability of the data and other information to be used); and

       * (iii) has agreed that that methodology is suitable for making it; and

     * (c) the internal expert makes the revaluation in accordance with that methodology.

         * Note: This subsection also applies to some revaluations that are not allowed by the accounting standards (see subsection 820684(5)).

    * Revaluation of individual assets

    * (2C) Subsection (1) does not prevent the entity from revaluing one or more assets in a class of assets (as distinct from revaluing all the assets in the class) if the value of no asset in that class has fallen since the entity last calculated the total value of all the assets in that class in accordance with the *accounting standards.

    * When further revaluation of assets required

    * (2D) If:

     * (a) the entity revalues one or more assets (whether constituting a class of assets or not) for the purpose of calculating the value of its assets for the purposes of this Division as applying to the entity for a particular period (the **_first period_**); and

     * (b) the revaluation is _not_ required by the *accounting standards; and

     * (c) if the revaluation _had_ been required by the accounting standards, the entity could have relied on it in preparing financial statements that the entity is required by an Australian law to prepare for a period (the **_later period_**) that ends _after_ the first period;

    * the entity may also rely on the revaluation in calculating the value of its assets for the purposes of this Division as applying to the entity for a period that is or includes all or part of the later period.

    * (2E) If subsection (2D) does _not_ permit the entity to rely on the revaluation in calculating the value of its assets for the purposes of this Division as applying to the entity for a period that is later than the first period, the revaluation is disregarded in determining whether subsection (1) requires the entity to revalue the one or more assets in calculating the value of its assets for those purposes.

         * Note: As a result, the entity may not be required to make a further revaluation of the one or more assets. However, if the entity does not, it must use the value of the one or more assets that is reflected in financial statements for the relevant period that comply with the accounting standards.

    * Accounting standards need not otherwise apply to the entity

    * (3) Subsection (1) has effect whether the *accounting standard would otherwise apply to the entity or not.

##### 820682  Recognition of assets and liabilities--modifying application of accounting standards

    * Deferred tax assets and deferred tax liabilities

    * (1) Despite subsections 820680(1) and (1A), an entity must not recognise:

     * (a) a deferred tax liability (within the meaning of the *accounting standards) as a liability for the purposes of this Division; or

     * (b) a deferred tax asset (within the meaning of the accounting standards) as an asset for the purposes of this Division.

         * Note: Subsections 820680(1) and (1A) require compliance with accounting standards.

    * Surpluses and deficits in defined benefit superannuation plans

    * (2) Despite subsections 820680(1) and (1A), an entity must not recognise an amount relating to a defined benefit plan (within the meaning of the *accounting standards) as:

     * (a) a liability for the purposes of this Division; or

     * (b) an asset for the purposes of this Division.

         * Note: Subsections 820680(1) and (1A) require compliance with accounting standards.

    * Not applicable to ADIs

    * (3) This section does not apply in relation to an entity for a period if, for the period, the entity is an *outward investing entity (ADI) or an *inward investing entity (ADI).

    * Not applicable to records about Australian permanent establishments

    * (4) This section does not apply for the purposes of section 820960.

##### 820683  Recognition of internally generated intangible items--modifying application of accounting standards

    * Accounting standards prevent recognition of some items

    * (1) Subsection (2) applies in relation to an item, other than internally generated goodwill (within the meaning of *accounting standard AASB 138), if:

     * (a) the item cannot be recognised under that standard as an internally generated intangible asset (within the meaning of that standard) because that standard determines that the cost of the item cannot be distinguished from the cost of developing the entity's business as a whole; and

     * (b) the item would otherwise meet criteria under that standard for recognition as such an asset.

         * Note 1: As a general rule, an entity must comply with the accounting standards when recognising its assets for the purposes of this Division (see subsections 820680(1) and (1A)).

         * Note 2: This section does not apply to ADIs (see subsection (6)).

    * Entity may choose to recognise the item as an intangible asset

    * (2) Despite subsections 820680(1) and (1A), the entity may choose to recognise the item as such an asset for a period for the purposes of this Division (other than section 820960).

         * Note: Section 820960 is about records for Australian permanent establishments.

    * (3) A choice under subsection (2):

     * (a) must be in writing and may cover more than one item; and

     * (b) must be made before the due day for lodging the entity's *income tax return for the income year that is, or that includes, the period; and

     * (c) subject to subsection (4), has effect, for the entity and the item, for the period and each later period.

    * (4) The entity may, in writing, revoke a choice under subsection (2). The revocation has effect:

     * (a) for each period in the income year for which the entity is next required to lodge an *income tax return; and

     * (b) for each later period.

    * (5) When:

     * (a) recognising an item as an asset under this section; and

     * (b) calculating the value of the asset (including revaluing the asset);

    * the entity must, to the maximum extent possible, comply with the *accounting standards as if the recognition were allowed by those standards. This subsection has effect subject to section 820684.

         * Note: Section 820684 will allow the entity to revalue the asset even if accounting standard AASB 138 would prevent this because of the absence of an active market.

    * Choice not available to ADIs

    * (6) An entity cannot make a choice under subsection (2) for a period if, for the period, the entity is an *outward investing entity (ADI) or an *inward investing entity (ADI).

##### 820684  Valuation of intangible assets if no active market--modifying application of accounting standards

    * Accounting standards prevent revaluation of some assets

    * (1) Subsection (2) applies if complying with *accounting standard AASB 138 would prevent an entity from revaluing an intangible asset (within the meaning of that standard) because of the absence of an active market (within the meaning of that standard).

         * Note 1: As a general rule, an entity must comply with the accounting standards when revaluing its assets for the purposes of this Division (see subsection 820680(1)).

         * Note 2: This section does not apply to ADIs (see subsection (7)).

    * Entity may choose to revalue the asset

    * (2) Despite subsection 820680(1), the entity may choose to revalue the asset for a period for the purposes of this Division (other than section 820960).

         * Note: Section 820960 is about records for Australian permanent establishments.

    * (3) A choice under subsection (2):

     * (a) must be in writing and may cover more than one asset; and

     * (b) must be made before the due day for lodging the entity's *income tax return for the income year that is, or that includes, the period; and

     * (c) subject to subsection (4), has effect, for the entity and the item, for the period and each later period.

    * (4) The entity may, in writing, revoke a choice under subsection (2). The revocation has effect:

     * (a) for each period in the income year for which the entity is next required to lodge an *income tax return; and

     * (b) for each later period.

    * Requirements for such revaluations

    * (5) Subsections 820680(2) and (2B) apply in relation to a revaluation under subsection (2) in a corresponding way to the way they apply in relation to a revaluation mentioned in paragraph 820680(1)(a).

         * Note 1: Subsections 820680(2) and (2B) set out requirements and other matters in relation to revaluations under subsection 820680(1).

         * Note 2: The entity must also keep records in accordance with section 820985 about the revaluation.

    * (6) When revaluing an asset under subsection (2), the entity must, to the maximum extent possible, comply with the *accounting standards as if the revaluation were allowed by those standards.

    * Choice not available to ADIs

    * (7) An entity cannot make a choice under subsection (2) for a period if, for the period, the entity is an *outward investing entity (ADI) or an *inward investing entity (ADI).

##### 820685  Valuation of debt capital

    * For the purposes of this Division, the regulations may make additional provisions for the valuation of the *debt capital of an entity.

##### 820690  Commissioner's power

    * If the Commissioner considers that, in relation to a calculation under this Division, an entity has:

     * (a) overvalued its assets; or

     * (b) undervalued its liabilities (including its *debt capital);

    * the Commissioner may, having regard to the *accounting standards and this Subdivision, substitute a value that the Commissioner considers is appropriate.

         * Note: Paragraphs 820875(2)(a) and (b) set out special rules under which an entity is taken to hold a TC control tracing interest in another entity that is equal to 100%, which could then be taken into account in calculating a TC indirect control interest.

##### 820795  What is a foreign controlled Australian partnership?

    * Corporate limited partnership

    * Meaning of TC control interest

    * (1) The **_thin capitalisation control interest_** (or **_TC control interest_**) that an entity holds in a company, trust or partnership at a particular time is the total of the following interests:

     * (a) the *TC direct control interest (if any) held by the entity in the company, trust or partnership at that time;

     * (b) the *TC indirect control interest (if any) held by the entity in the company, trust or partnership at that time;

     * (c) the TC direct control interests (if any) held by the entity's *associate entities in the company, trust or partnership at that time;

     * (d) the TC indirect control interests (if any) held by the entity's associate entities in the company, trust or partnership at that time.

    * This section has effect subject to sections 820820 to 820835 (which set out special rules to avoid double counting).

         * Note: For the rules about a TC direct control interest, see sections 820855 to 820865. For the rules about a TC indirect control interest, see sections 820870 to 820875.

    * (2) This section does not apply to an *associate entity of the entity if:

##### 820820  Special rules about calculating TC control interest held by an entity

    * (1) This section applies for the purposes of calculating the *TC control interest that an entity holds in a company, trust or partnership.

    * (2) Disregard a *TC indirect control interest held by the entity to the extent to which it is calculated by reference to:

     * (a) a *TC direct control interest taken into account under paragraph 820815(c); or

     * (b) a TC indirect control interest taken into account under paragraph 820815(d).

     * (b) a TC indirect control interest taken into account under paragraph 820815(b) or (d).

    * (3A) Subsection (3) does not apply to an *associate entity of the entity if:

     * (a) the associate entity is a *foreign entity and the associate entity is such an associate entity only because of subsection 820905(3A); or

     * (b) the associate entity is such an associate entity only because of subsection 820905(3B).

    * (4) Take into account only one of the following things if both would otherwise be counted in calculating the *TC control interest:

     * (a) the holding of a *TC direct control interest by the entity or any other entity;

     * (b) an entitlement to acquire that TC direct control interest.

    * (5) The operation of this section in relation to an entity does not prevent the operation of section 820825 in relation to a group of entities that includes that entity.

##### 820825  Special rules about calculating TC control interests held by a group of entities

    * (1) This section applies for the purposes of calculating the total *TC control interests that a group of entities holds in a company, trust or partnership.

    * (2) Take into account a particular *TC direct control interest or *TC indirect control interest only once if it would otherwise be counted more than once because the entity holding it is an *associate entity of one or more entities in the group. 

    * (2A) Subsection (2) does not apply to an *associate entity of one or more entities in the group if:

     * (a) the associate entity is a *foreign entity and the associate entity is such an associate entity only because of subsection 820905(3A); or

     * (b) the associate entity is such an associate entity only because of subsection 820905(3B).

    * (3) Take into account only one of the following things if both of them would otherwise be counted in calculating the total *TC control interests:

     * (a) the holding of a *TC direct control interest by an entity;

     * (b) an entitlement to acquire that TC direct control interest.

    * (4) The operation of this section in relation to a group of entities does not prevent the operation of section 820820 in relation to an entity that is a member of that group.

##### 820830  Special rules about determining percentage of TC control interest

    * (1) This section applies for the purposes of determining whether an entity, or a group of entities, holds at least a particular percentage of *TC control interests for the purposes of a provision in this Subdivision.

    * (2) If, apart from this subsection, an entity, or each of 2 or more entities, would hold a *TC direct control interest equal to 100%, or a *TC control tracing interest equal to 100%, in another entity (the **_controlled entity_**):

     * (a) only the entity, or one of the 2 or more entities, is to be taken to hold that particular interest in the controlled entity equal to 100%; and

     * (b) another entity is not to be taken to hold that particular interest in the controlled entity (whether or not it would, apart from this subsection, hold that interest in the controlled entity equal to 100%).

##### 820835  Commissioner's power

    * For the purposes of this Subdivision, the Commissioner may decide:

     * (a) which one of 2 things is to be taken into account for the purposes of subsection 820820(4) or subsection 820825(3); or

##### TC direct control interest, TC indirect control interest and TC control tracing interest

##### 820855  TC direct control interest in a company

    * (1) A **_thin capitalisation direct control interest _**(or a **_TC direct control interest_**) that an entity holds in a company (except a *corporate limited partnership) at a particular time is the percentage of the direct control interest (if any) that the entity holds in the company at that time under the provisions applied by subsection (2).

         * Note: For the TC direct control interest that an entity holds in a corporate limited partnership, see section 820865.

    * (2) For the purposes of subsection (1), provisions of Part X of the _Income Tax Assessment Act 1936_ are applied with the modifications set out in the following table.

##### 820860  TC direct control interest in a trust

    * (1) A **_thin capitalisation direct control interest _**(or a **_TC direct control interest_**) that an entity holds in a trust at a particular time is the percentage of the direct control interest (if any) that the entity holds in the trust at that time under the provisions applied by subsection (2).

    * (2) For the purposes of subsection (1), provisions of Part X of the _Income Tax Assessment Act 1936_ are applied with the modifications set out in the following table.

    * (3) In addition, for the purposes of determining whether or not an entity (other than a trust mentioned in paragraph (a) or (b)) is a *foreign controlled Australian entity:

     * (a) if a trust is covered by paragraph 820790(1)(c)--a foreign entity that is an object of the trust at a particular time is taken to hold, at that time, a TC direct control interest in the trust that is equal to 100%; and

     * (b) if a trust is covered by paragraph 820790(1)(d)--a foreign entity that is in a position to control the trust at a particular time is taken to hold, at that time, a *TC direct control interest in the trust that is equal to 100%.

         * Note: The foreign entity therefore holds a TC control tracing interest in the trust (see section 820875). That interest may then be taken into account in calculating any TC indirect control interest that the foreign entity holds in another entity in relation to which the trust is an interposed entity (see section 820870). As a result, that other entity may become a foreign controlled Australian entity.

##### 820865  TC direct control interest in a partnership

    * A **_thin capitalisation direct control interest _**(or a **_TC direct control interest_**) that an entity holds in a partnership at a particular time is whichever of the following percentages is applicable, and if there are 2 or more such percentages, the greatest of them:

     * (a) in the case of a *corporate limited partnership--100% if the entity is a *general partner of the partnership;

##### 820870  TC indirect control interest in a company, trust or partnership

    * What is a TC indirect control interest?

    * (1) An entity holds a **_thin capitalisation indirect control interest _**(or a **_TC indirect control interest_**) in a company, trust or partnership at a particular time if, and only if:

     * (a) there is an interposed entity, or a continuous series of at least 2 interposed entities, between that entity and the company, trust or partnership; and

     * (b) the interposed entity, or each of the interposed entities, is:

       * (i) a *foreign controlled Australian entity if this section is used for the purposes of determining whether or not an entity is a foreign controlled Australian entity; or

       * (ii) an *Australian controlled foreign entity if this section is used for the purposes of determining whether or not an entity is an Australian controlled foreign entity or an *Australian controller of such an entity.

         * Note: In the case of a continuous series of interposed entities between an entity and a company, trust or partnership, the entity must hold a TC control tracing interest in the first interposed entity (see subsection (2)). In addition, under subsection (2), each interposed entity in the series must hold a TC control tracing interest in the next interposed entity (except in the case of the last one, which holds a TC control tracing interest in the company, trust or partnership).

    * What is an interposed entity?

    * (2) For the purposes of this section, an entity (the**_ middle entity_**) is interposed between 2 other entities at a particular time if, and only if, at that time:

     * (a) the first of those 2 entities holds a *TC control tracing interest in the middle entity; and

     * (b) the middle entity holds a TC control tracing interest in the second of those 2 entities.

         * Note: For the rules about a TC control tracing interest, see section 820875.

    * How to calculate a TC indirect control interest

    * (3) The *TC indirect control interest that an entity (the**_ top entity_**) holds in a company, trust or partnership at a particular time is calculated in accordance with subsection (4), (5) or (6) (as appropriate).

    * One interposed entity only

    * (4) The *TC indirect control interest is the result of applying the following method statement if there is only one interposed entity between the top entity and the company, trust or partnership at that time.

Method statement

       * Step 1.	Calculate the *TC control tracing interest that the top entity holds in the interposed entity at that time.

       * Step 2.	Multiply the result of step 1 by the *TC control tracing interest that the interposed entity holds in the company, trust or partnership at that time.

    * 2 interposed entities

    * (5) The *TC indirect control interest is the result of applying the following method statement if there are 2 interposed entities between the top entity and the company, trust or partnership at that time.

Method statement

       * Step 1.	Calculate the *TC control tracing interest that the top entity holds in the first of those interposed entities at that time.

       * Step 2.	Multiply the result of step 1 by the *TC control tracing interest that the first interposed entity holds in the next interposed entity (the **_second interposed entity_**) at that time.

       * Step 3.	Multiply the result of step 2 by the *TC control tracing interest that the second interposed entity holds in the company, trust or partnership at that time.

    * More than 2 interposed entities

    * (6) The *TC indirect control interest is the result of applying the following method statement if there are more than 2 interposed entities between the top entity and the company, trust or partnership at that time.

Method statement

       * Step 1.	Calculate the *TC control tracing interest that the top entity holds in the first of those interposed entities at that time.

       * Step 2.	Multiply the result of step 1 by the *TC control tracing interest that the first interposed entity holds in the next interposed entity (the **_second interposed entity_**) at that time.

       * Step 3.	Multiply the result of step 2 by the *TC control tracing interest that the second interposed entity holds in the next interposed entity at that time.

       * Step 4.	Continue this pattern of multiplying the result of the last multiplication by the *TC control tracing interest in the next interposed entity held by the preceding entity, ending with a multiplication by the TC control tracing interest held by the last interposed entity in the company, trust or partnership.

##### 820875  TC control tracing interest in a company, trust or partnership

    * (1) A **_thin capitalisation control tracing interest _**(or a **_TC control tracing interest_**) that an entity holds in a company, trust or a partnership at a particular time is equal to the *TC direct control interest in the company, trust or partnership that the entity holds at that time.

    * (2) Despite subsection (1), an entity is taken to hold a *TC control tracing interest in a company, trust or partnership that is equal to 100% at a particular time if, at that time:

     * (a) the entity and its *associate entities hold a total of *TC direct control interests in the company, trust or partnership that is 50% or more; or

     * (b) the following subparagraphs apply:

       * (i) the entity (the **_controlling entity_**) and its associate entities hold a total of TC direct control interests that is 40% or more in the company, trust or partnership;

       * (ii) no other entity or entities (except the controlling entity, its associate entities or entities including the controlling entity or its associate entities) control the company, trust or partnership; or

     * (c) the entity (whether or not together with associate entities) controls the company, trust or partnership.

    * (3) Paragraph (2)(b) does not apply if the *TC direct control interests mentioned in subparagraph (2)(b)(i) are held in a *corporate limited partnership.

##### 820920  Associate entity excess amount

    * (1) This section applies to an entity (the **_relevant entity_**) that is an *outward investing entity (nonADI) or an *inward investing entity (nonADI) for a period that is all or a part of an income year.

    * (2) The relevant entity's **_associate entity excess amount_** at a particular time during that period is the result of applying the method statement in this subsection.

Method statement

       * Step 1.	Work out the premium excess amount (see subsection (3)), as at that particular time, for an *associate entity of the relevant entity that is the issuer of an *equity interest or a *debt interest any value of which is all or a part of the relevant entity's *associate entity equity at that time.

       * Step 2.	Add to the result of step 1 the attributable safe harbour excess amount (see subsection (4)) for that *associate entity as at that time.

       * Step 3.	Apply steps 1 and 2 to all such *associate entities of the relevant entity and add all the results that are positive amounts. The result of this step is the **_associate entity excess amount_**.

    * (3) An *associate entity's **_premium excess amount_** at a particular time during that period is the result of applying the method statement in this subsection. In applying the method statement, disregard any amount that is attributable to an entity's *overseas permanent establishments if it is an *outward investing entity (nonADI) at that time.

Method statement

       * Step 1.	Work out the value, as at that particular time, of all the *associate entity equity of the relevant entity that is attributable to the *associate entity (disregarding the value of any *debt interest *issued by the associate entity that is held by the relevant entity at that time).

       * Step 2.	Work out the value, as at that time, of all the *equity capital of the *associate entity that is attributable to *equity interests that the relevant entity holds in the associate entity at that time (except equity interests whose value is all or a part of the relevant entity's *controlled foreign entity equity at that time).

       * Step 3.	Reduce the result of step 1 by the result of step 2. However, if the result of step 2 is a negative amount, the result of step 2 is taken to be nil for the purpose of this step.

       * Step 4.	Multiply the result of step 3 by:

         * (a) 15/16 if the *associate entity excess amount is applied for the purpose of working out the *total debt amount of the relevant entity for that period under subsection 820100(2), 820200(2) or 820210(2); or

         * (b) 3/5 if the associate entity excess amount is applied for the purpose of working out the *adjusted onlent amount of the relevant entity for that period under subsection 820100(3), 820200(3) or 820210(3); or

         * (c) 3/5 if the associate entity excess amount is applied for the purpose of working out the *safe harbour debt amount of the relevant entity for that period under section 82095, 820195 or 820205; or

         * (d) the result of step 4 of the method statement in subsection (1) or (2) of section 820110 (as appropriate) if the associate entity excess amount is applied for the purpose of working out the *worldwide gearing debt amount of the relevant entity for that period.

       * The result of this step is the **_premium excess amount_**.

    * (4) The *associate entity's **_attributable safe harbour excess amount_** at a particular time during that period is the result of applying the method statement in this subsection. In applying the method statement, disregard any amount that is attributable to an entity's *overseas permanent establishments if it is an *outward investing entity (nonADI) at that time.

Method statement

       * Step 1.	Work out the *safe harbour debt amount of the *associate entity for the day during which that particular time occurs, as if:

         * (a) the associate entity were an *outward investing entity (nonADI) or *inward investing entity (nonADI), as appropriate, for the period consisting only of that day; and

         * (b) if the associate entity would otherwise be treated as an *outward investor (financial) for that day and the relevant entity is not a *financial entity throughout that day--the associate entity were an *outward investor (general) for that day; and

         * (c) if the associate entity would otherwise be treated as an *inward investment vehicle (financial) for that day and the relevant entity is not a financial entity throughout that day--the associate entity were an *inward investment vehicle (general) for that day; and

         * (d) if the associate entity would otherwise be treated as an *inward investor (financial) for that day and the relevant entity is not a financial entity throughout that day--the associate entity were an *inward investor (general) for that day.

       * Step 2.	Reduce the result of step 1 by the value of the *adjusted average debt of the *associate entity for that day as if it had been the kind of entity that it is taken to be under step 1 for that day. If the result of this step is a negative amount, it is taken to be nil.

       * Step 3.	Multiply the result of step 2 by the sum of:

         * (a) the value, as at that time, of all the *equity capital of the *associate entity that is attributable to the relevant entity at that time; and

         * (b) the value, as at that time, of all the *debt interests *issued by the associate entity that are covered by subsection (5), and held by the relevant entity, at that time; and

         * (c) the value, as at that time, of all the debt interests issued by the associate entity that are covered by subsection (6), and held by the relevant entity, at that time.

       * Step 4.	Divide the result of step 3 by the sum of:

         * (a) the value, as at that time, of all the *equity capital of the *associate entity; and

         * (b) the value, as at that time, of all the *debt interests *issued by the associate entity that are covered by subsection (5) at that time; and

         * (c) the value, as at that time, of all the debt interests issued by the associate entity that are covered by subsection (6) at that time.

    * (5) For the purposes of the method statement in subsection (4), this subsection covers a *debt interest at a particular time if the interest satisfies all of the following:

##### Table of sections

      * 820942	How to work out the zerocapital amount

##### 820942  How to work out the zerocapital amount

    * (1) An entity's **_zerocapital amount_** at a particular time is the result of the method statement in this subsection.

Method statement

       * Step 1.	Work out the total value, as at that particular time, of all the assets of the entity that represent *debt interests that:

         * (a) are of a kind commonly dealt in by entities that carry on a *business of dealing in securities; and

         * (b) the entity has sold under a reciprocal purchase agreement (otherwise known as a repurchase agreement), sellbuyback arrangement or securities loan arrangement; and

         * (c) the entity has not yet repurchased under the agreement or arrangement.

       * Step 2.	Add to the result of step 1 the total value, as at that time, of all the *debt interests issued to the entity to which the following paragraphs apply at that time:

         * (a) the debt interests remain *on issue;

         * (b) each of the debt interests is a loan of money for which no fees, charges or other consideration for the purpose of enhancing the credit rating of the issuer of the interest has been paid or is payable to the entity, any of the entity's *associates or another entity that is a *foreign entity;

         * (c) each of the entities issuing the interests has the required credit rating for the interests concerned in accordance with subsections (4) and (5).

       * Step 3.	Add to the result of step 2 the total value, as at that time, of all the *debt interests that are assets of the entity (whether they are debt interests issued to the entity or not) and to which the following paragraphs apply at that time:

         * (a) the risk weight of each of the debt interests is either 0% or 20% under the *prudential standards;

         * (b) the debt interests do not satisfy all of the paragraphs in step 2.

       * Step 3A_._	Add to the result of step 3 the total value, as at that time, of all the assets of the entity, to the extent that they:

         * (a) consist of rights to the return of assets covered by subsection (2A); and

         * (b) are covered by none of steps 1, 2 and 3.

       * Step 4.	Add to the result of step 3A the total value, as at that time, of all the *securitised assets that the entity has at that time if the entity is a *securitisation vehicle at that time (see subsections (2) and (3)). The result is the **_zerocapital amount_**.

    * (2A) This subsection covers an asset that:

     * (a) the entity provided as security for the performance of its obligations in relation to securities it acquired under a reciprocal purchase agreement (otherwise known as a repurchase agreement), sellbuyback arrangement or securities loan arrangement; and

     * (e) the entity has not issued debt interests for any purpose other than for the purpose of funding the acquisition of the securitised assets; and

     * (f) there are no debt interests issued to the entity by any of the entity's associate entities, the originator or any associate entity of the originator; and

     * (g) any *arrangements the entity has with any of its associate entities, the originator or any associate entity of the originator are those that would reasonably be expected to have been entered into by parties dealing at *arm's length with each other.

         * Note: An entity that does not qualify as a securitisation vehicle may be exempt from the thin capitalisation rules under section 82039.

    * Securitised assets

    * (3) An asset of an entity is a **_securitised asset_** if:

     * (a) the entity is a *securitisation vehicle; and

     * (b) the asset consists of:

       * (i) *debt interests issued by an entity other than the originator in relation to the securitisation vehicle that is mentioned in paragraph (2)(b); or

       * (ii) a lease for the hire of goods that would be a lease covered by paragraph (b) of the definition of **_onlent amount_** if a reference to an entity in that definition were a reference to that originator; or

    * What is the required credit rating?

    * (4) For the purposes of step 2 of the method statement in subsection (1), the required credit rating for an entity issuing a *debt interest is:

     * (a) if the interest is a *subordinated debt interest--a longterm foreign currency corporate credit rating of at least A (or equivalent) given to the entity by an internationally recognised rating agency; or

     * (b) if the interest is a not a subordinated debt interest--a longterm foreign currency corporate credit rating of at least BBB (or equivalent) given to the entity by an internationally recognised rating agency.

##### 83080  Setting the tax cost of partners' interests in the assets of an entity that becomes a foreign hybrid

    * (1) This section applies if:

     * (a) an entity is a *foreign hybrid in relation to an income year (the **_hybrid year_**); and

     * (b) the entity was in existence at the end of the preceding income year (which may be the income year before this Division first applies to the entity); and

     * (c) the entity was not a foreign hybrid in relation to that preceding income year.

    * (2) For the purposes of applying an *assetbased income tax regime for the hybrid year and each later income year in relation to which the entity continues to be a foreign hybrid, the *tax cost is set at the start of the hybrid year, for each asset of the *foreign hybrid in which each partner has an interest at that time.

##### 83085  Setting the tax cost of assets of an entity when it ceases to be a foreign hybrid

    * (1) This section applies if:

     * (a) an entity is a *foreign hybrid in relation to an income year; and

     * (b) the entity is in existence at the start of the next income year; and

     * (c) the entity is not a foreign hybrid in relation to that income year (the **_posthybrid year_**).

    * (2) For the purposes of applying an *assetbased income tax regime for the posthybrid year and each later income year in relation to which the entity continues not to be a foreign hybrid, the *tax cost is set at the start of the posthybrid year, for each asset of the entity at that time.

##### 83090  What the expression tax cost is set means

    * The following table explains what the expression **_tax cost is set _**at the start of the hybrid year or the posthybrid year means, in relation to an asset in which a partner has an interest or in relation to an asset of the entity, for the purposes of each *assetbased income tax regime:

##### 83095  What the expression tax cost setting amount means

    * (1) A partner's**_ tax cost setting amount_** for an interest of the partner in an asset at the start of the hybrid year, in relation to an *assetbased income tax regime, is worked out as follows:

Method statement

       * Step 1.	Work out what would have been the entity's *tax cost of the asset for the purposes of applying the *assetbased income tax regime as at the start of the hybrid year if it were not a *foreign hybrid in relation to the hybrid year.

       * Step 2.	Multiply the result of step 1 by:

         * (a) if the entity is a *foreign hybrid company in relation to the hybrid year--the percentage applicable to the partner under subsection 83035(2); or

         * (b) if the entity is a *foreign hybrid limited partnership in relation to the hybrid year--the individual interest of the partner in the asset, expressed as a percentage of the interests of all of the partners in the asset.

       * Step 3.	If the partner paid a premium in respect of the *acquisition of its interest in the asset (see subsection (2)), add the amount of the premium to the result of step 2. If the partner received a discount in respect of the acquisition (see subsection (2)), subtract the amount of the discount from the result of step 2, but not to the extent that this would result in a negative amount.

       * _	_The result of step 3 is the partner's **_tax cost setting amount_** in respect of the asset.

    * (2) Work out whether the partner paid a premium or received a discount for its interest in the asset using the following method statement:

Method Statement

       * Step 1.	Add up all the amounts paid by the partner before the start of the hybrid year for its *shares in the entity (if the entity was a company), or for its interests in the assets of the entity and in the entity (if the entity was a *limited partnership), that it held at the start of the hybrid year, and subtract all amounts received by the partner in respect of those shares or interests by way of reduction in capital of the entity.

       * Step 2.	Work out the amount that, if the capital of the entity had been distributed to its *shareholders on a windingup or to its partners on a dissolution, at the end of the income year before the hybrid year, the partner could reasonably be expected to have received of the total distribution.

       * Step 3.	If the result of step 1 exceeds the result of step 2, the partner paid a premium for its interest in the asset. If the result of step 2 exceeds the result of step 1, the partner received a discount for its interest in the asset.

       * Step 4.	Work out the amount of the premium or discount using the formula:

    * (3) The entity's **_tax cost setting amount_** for an asset at the start of the posthybrid year in relation to an *assetbased income tax regime is equal to the sum of what the partners' *tax costs for their interests in the asset would be at that time for the purpose of applying the assetbased income tax regime if the entity had continued to be a *foreign hybrid in relation to that income year.

##### 830100  What the expression tax cost means

    * The **_tax cost _**of a partner's interest in an asset or of an asset of the entity for the purposes of applying an *assetbased income tax regime at the start of the posthybrid year or the hybrid year is worked out using the following table:

##### 830105  What the expression assetbased income tax regime means

    * The provisions listed in the first column in relation to each item in the table in section 830100 are an **_assetbased income tax regime_**.

##### 830110  No disposal of assets etc. on entity becoming or ceasing to be a foreign hybrid

    * To avoid doubt, the fact that an entity becomes or ceases to be a *foreign hybrid in relation to an income year does not cause:

     * (a) a *CGT event to happen to any *CGT asset consisting of:

       * (i) any *share or interest in the entity; or

       * (ii) any interest in an asset of the entity; or

     * (b) a disposal or any other event to happen to any other asset consisting of such a share or interest.

##### 830115  Tax losses cannot be transferred to a foreign hybrid

    * (1) If an entity is a *foreign hybrid in relation to an income year, it cannot deduct in that income year a *tax loss for a *loss year in relation to which it was not a foreign hybrid.

    * Former foreign hybrid can deduct tax losses for income years before it became a foreign hybrid

    * (2) This section does not prevent an entity that:

     * (a) is not a *foreign hybrid in relation to an income year (the **_posthybrid year_**); and

     * (b) was a foreign hybrid in relation to a previous income year; and

     * (c) was not a foreign hybrid in relation to an income year (the **_prehybrid year_**) before the previous year;

    * from deducting, in the posthybrid year, a *tax loss for the prehybrid year.

##### 830120  End of CFC's last statutory accounting period

    * If: 

     * (a) a taxpayer is a partner in an entity that becomes a *foreign hybrid in relation to an income year; and

     * (b) the entity was a *CFC at the end of the taxpayer's preceding income year; and

     * (c) the last *statutory accounting period of the CFC did not end at the end of the taxpayer's preceding income year; and

     * (d) if it had so ended, the taxpayer would have been an *attributable taxpayer in relation to the CFC;

    * for the purposes of working out the *attributable income of the CFC for the taxpayer in respect of the last statutory accounting period of the CFC, that statutory accounting period ends at the end of the taxpayer's preceding income year.

##### 830125  How long interest in asset, or asset, held

    * Partner's interest in asset when entity becomes a foreign hybrid

    * (1) If an entity becomes a *foreign hybrid company in relation to an income year, the interest that a partner has in an asset as mentioned in section 83035 is taken to have been held by the partner (except for the purposes of having the *tax cost of the interest set) from the later of the following times:

     * (a) when the entity *acquired the asset;

     * (b) when the partner acquired its *shares in the entity.

    * Entity's asset when it ceases to be a foreign hybrid company

    * (2) If:

     * (a) an entity is not a *foreign hybrid company in relation to an income year (the **_posthybrid year_**); and

     * (b) the entity was a *foreign hybrid company in relation to the preceding income year; and

     * (c) during:

       * (i) that preceding income year; or

       * (ii) any earlier income year in relation to which the entity was also a foreign hybrid;

     * but not at the start of the first income year in relation to which the entity was a foreign hybrid company, the partners in the foreign hybrid company *acquired an interest in an asset that is an asset of the entity at the start of the posthybrid year;

    * the asset is taken to have been held by the entity (except for the purposes of having the *tax cost of the asset set) from the time the partners acquired their interests in the asset.

     * (c) disregard an amount to the extent that it is referable to an *IMR capital gain or an*IMR capital loss.

##### 842225  Treatment of trustee of an IMR foreign fund

    * Objects

    * (1) The object of this section is to ensure that the following provisions interact appropriately with the tax concessions mentioned in paragraphs 842210(1)(a) and (b), paragraphs 842215(1)(a) and (b) and paragraphs 842220(1)(a) and (b):

     * (a) subsection 115220(2);

     * (b) section 115225;

     * (c) section 98 of the _Income Tax Assessment Act 1936_;

     * (d) section 99E of the _Income Tax Assessment Act 1936_.

         * Note: Division 6 of Part III of the _Income Tax Assessment Act 1936_, Division 115 of Part 31 of this Act, and all other provisions of those Acts apply to the trustee of an IMR foreign fund, subject to the modifications in this section.

    * Applying subsection 115220(2)

    * (2) For the purposes of applying subsection 115220(2) to the beneficiary:

     * (a) disregard a *capital gain of the *IMR foreign fund to the extent the capital gain is an *IMR capital gain; and

     * (b) disregard an *IMR capital loss of the IMR foreign fund for the purposes of determining the amount of the capital gain remaining after applying steps 1 to 4 of the method statement in subsection 1025(1); and

     * (c) disregard a *net capital loss of the IMR foreign fund to the extent that it is attributable to an IMR capital loss for the purposes of determining how much of a capital gain that is not an IMR capital gain remains after applying steps 1 to 4 of the method statement in subsection 1025(1).

         * Note: The effect of this subsection is that the increase to the assessable amount which occurs as a result of section 115220 is calculated with reference to the capital gains of the IMR foreign fund that are not IMR capital gains or amounts referable to IMR capital gains (rather than by calculating the increase with reference to _all_ capital gains of the fund).

    * Modifications to section 115225

    * (3) For the purposes of applying section 115225 in respect of section 115220, make the following assumptions:

     * (a) replace the references in section 115225 to the net income of the trust estate with references to the *nonIMR net income of the trust estate;

     * (b) replace the reference in section 115225 to net capital gain (if any) with a reference to *nonIMR net capital gain (if any).

    * Modifications to section 98 of the Income Tax Assessment Act 1936

    * (4) For the purposes of applying section 98 of the _Income Tax Assessment Act 1936_, replace references in that section to net income with references to nonIMR net income (within the meaning of subsection 842260(1) of the _Income Tax Assessment Act 1997_).

         * Note: The effect of this subsection is that where section 98 of the _Income Tax Assessment Act 1936 _applies to the trustee of a trust that is an IMR foreign fund, the trustee is only assessed and made liable to pay tax in respect of nonIMR net income of the fund (rather than in respect of _all_ net income of the fund to which section 98 would otherwise apply).

    * Modifications to section 99E of the Income Tax Assessment Act 1936

    * (5) For the purposes of applying section 99E of the _Income Tax Assessment Act 1936_:

     * (a) replace the reference in that section to so much of the net income with a reference to so much of the net income or nonIMR net income (within the meaning of subsection 842260(1) of the _Income Tax Assessment Act 1997_) as the case may be; and

     * (b) replace the reference in that section to a part of the net income of another trust estate with a reference to a part of the nonIMR net income (within the meaning of subsection 842260(1) of the _Income Tax Assessment Act 1997_) of another trust estate.

         * Note: The effect of this subsection is that the trustee of a trust that receives a distribution of nonIMR net income from another trust is not required to apply section 98, 99 or 99A of the _Income Tax Assessment Act 1936_ to those amounts.

    * Certain losses disregarded

    * (6) The trust cannot *utilise a *tax loss or *net capital loss in relation to an income year, or any future income year, to the extent the loss is attributable to *IMR income, an *IMR capital gain, an *IMR deduction or an *IMR capital loss.

    * A partnership's **_nonIMR partnership net income _**or **_nonIMR partnership loss _**in relation to an income year is determined by calculating the *net income or *partnership loss of the partnership as follows:

     * (a) disregard the *IMR income and *IMR deduction of the partnership for the income year;

     * (b) disregard any amount included in the partnership's assessable income under subsection 20735(1) to the extent that the amount is attributable to IMR income of the partnership for the income year;

     * (c) if the partnership is a beneficiary of a trust--then:

       * (i) for the purposes of applying Division 6 of Part III of the _Income Tax Assessment Act 1936_ to the beneficiary, replace the references in that Division to share of the net income with references to share of the nonIMR net income (within the meaning of subsection 842260(1) of the _Income Tax Assessment Act 1997_); and

       * (ii) for the purposes of applying Division 6E of Part III of the _Income Tax Assessment Act 1936_ to the beneficiary, replace references in that Division to Division 6E net income with references to nonIMR Division 6E net income (within the meaning of subsection 842260(2) of the _Income Tax Assessment Act 1997_);

     * (d) if the partnership is a partner in another partnership--for the purposes of applying Division 5 of Part III of the _Income Tax Assessment Act 1936_ to the partnership that is a partner, replace the references in that Division to the individual interest of the partner in the partnership net income or partnership loss with references to the individual interest of the partner in the nonIMR partnership net income or nonIMR partnership loss (within the meaning of those terms in section 842265 of the _Income Tax Assessment Act 1997_).

         * Note: The net income of a partnership may include a share of the net income of another partnership. Where there is a chain of partnerships, these calculations are applied to each partnership in the chain.

##### 8555  Objects of this Subdivision

    * (1) The objects of this Subdivision are to improve:

     * (a) 's status as an attractive place for business and investment; and

     * (b) the integrity of 's capital gains tax base.

    * (2) This is achieved by:

     * (a) aligning 's tax laws with international practice; and

     * (b) ensuring interests in an entity remain subject to 's capital gains tax laws if the entity's underlying value is principally derived from Australian real property.

##### 85510  Disregarding a capital gain or loss from CGT events

    * (1) Disregard a *capital gain or *capital loss from a *CGT event if:

     * (a) you are a foreign resident, or the trustee of a *foreign trust for CGT purposes, just before the CGT event happens; and

     * (b) the CGT event happens in relation to a *CGT asset that is not *taxable Australian property.

         * Note: A capital gain or capital loss from a CGT asset you have used at any time in carrying on a business through a permanent establishment in  may be reduced under section 85535.

    * (2) The *CGT asset in relation to which a *CGT event happens includes the following:

     * (a) for CGT event D1 (about creating contractual or other rights)--the CGT asset that is the subject of the creation of the contractual or other rights;

          * Example: You grant an easement over land in . The land is the subject of the creation of the rights in the easement. Therefore, the CGT event happens in relation to the land.

     * (b) for CGT event D2 (about granting an option)--the CGT asset that is the subject of the option;

     * (c) for CGT event F1 (about granting a lease)--the CGT asset that is the subject of the lease;

     * (d) for CGT event J1 (about a company ceasing to be a member of whollyowned group after rollover)--the rollover asset.

##### 85515  When an asset is taxable Australian property

    * There are 5 categories of *CGT assets that are **_taxable Australian property_**. They are set out in this table.

         * Note: An asset is also taxable Australian property if it was acquired by a company after 28 January 1988 and before 26 May 1988 from a foreign resident as a result of a disposal for which there was a rollover under section 160ZZN or 160ZZO of the _Income Tax Assessment Act 1936_: see section 13625 of the _Income Tax (Transitional Provisions) Act 1997_.

##### 85516  Meaning of permanent establishment article

    * A **_permanent establishment article_** is:

     * (a) Article 5 of the United Kingdom convention (within the meaning of the _International Tax Agreements Act 1953_); or

     * (b) a corresponding provision of another *international tax agreement.

##### 85520  Taxable Australian real property

    * A *CGT asset is **_taxable Australian real property_** if it is:

     * (a) real property situated in Australia (including a lease of land, if the land is situated in Australia); or

     * (b) a *mining, quarrying or prospecting right (to the extent that the right is not real property), if the *minerals, *petroleum or quarry materials are situated in .

##### 85525  Indirect Australian real property interests

    * (1) A *membership interest held by an entity (the **_holding entity_**) in another entity (the **_test entity_**) at a time is an **_indirect Australian real property interest_** at that time if:

     * (a) the interest passes the *nonportfolio interest test (see section 960195):

       * (i) at that time; or

       * (ii) throughout a 12 month period that began no earlier than 24 months before that time and ended no later than that time; and

     * (b) the interest passes the principal asset test in section 85530 at that time.

    * (2) For the purposes of subsection (1), in working out whether the interest passes the *nonportfolio interest test and the principal asset test in section 85530:

     * (a) apply section 350 of the _Income Tax Assessment Act 1936_ as if the words ", or is entitled to acquire," (wherever occurring) were omitted; and

     * (b) apply section 351 of that Act as if:

       * (i) the words ", or that the beneficiary is entitled to acquire" (wherever occurring) were omitted; and

       * (ii) the words ", or that the entity is entitled to acquire" in paragraph 351(2)(d) were omitted.

    * (3) The first element of the *cost base and *reduced cost base of a *CGT asset on 10 May 2005 is the *market value of the asset on that day if, on that day:

     * (a) the CGT asset was a *membership interest you held in another entity; and

     * (b) you were a foreign resident, or the trustee of a trust that was not a *resident trust for CGT purposes; and

     * (c) the CGT asset was a *postCGT asset; and

     * (d) the CGT asset did not have the necessary connection with  (within the meaning of this Act as in force on that day) disregarding the operation of paragraph (b) of item 5 and paragraph (b) of item 6 of the table in section 13625 (as in force on that day).

    * (4) Also, Parts 31 and 33 apply to the asset as if you had *acquired it on that day.

##### 85530  Principal asset test

    * (1) The purpose of this section is to define when an entity's underlying value is principally derived from Australian real property (see paragraph 8555(2)(b)).

    * (2) A *membership interest held by an entity (the **_holding entity_**) in another entity (the **_test entity_**) passes the principal asset test if the sum of the *market values of the test entity's assets that are *taxable Australian real property exceeds the sum of the *market values of its assets that are _not_ taxable Australian real property.

         * Note: The market value of any of the latter kind of assets that are duplicated within the test entity's corporate group could be disregarded (see section 85532).

    * (3) For the purposes of subsection (2), treat an asset of an entity (the **_first entity_**) that is a *membership interest in another entity (the **_other entity_**) as if it were instead the following 2 assets:

     * (a) an asset that is *taxable Australian real property (the **_TARP asset_**);

     * (b) an asset that is not taxable Australian real property (the **_nonTARP asset_**).

    * (4) For the purposes of subsection (2), treat the *market value of the TARP asset and the nonTARP asset according to the following table.

         * Note 1: For the purposes of item 2 of the table, it is necessary to work out the market value of any TARP assets and nonTARP assets in relation to any membership interests held by the other entity before working out the value of the TARP asset and nonTARP asset held by the first entity.

         * Note 2: The market value of an asset of the other entity that is not taxable Australian real property, and is duplicated within the other entity's corporate group, could be disregarded (see section 85532).

    * (5) For the purposes of this section, disregard the *market value of any asset acquired by the test entity, or by any other entity, if the *acquisition was done for a purpose (other than an incidental purpose) that included ensuring that a *membership interest in any entity would not pass the principal asset test in this section.

##### 85532  Disregard market value of duplicated nonTARP assets

    * (1) The purpose of this section is to prevent double counting of the *market value of the assets of a corporate group that:

     * (a) are not *taxable Australian real property; and

     * (b) are created under *arrangements under which corresponding liabilities are created in other members of the group.

    * (2) For the purposes of subsections 85530(2) and (4), subsection (4) of this section applies to an asset that is not *taxable Australian real property if:

     * (a) the parties to an *arrangement included the 2 entities referred to in subsection (3); and

     * (b) an effect of the arrangement was to create, before the *CGT event happened:

       * (i) the asset as an asset of one of those 2 parties; and

       * (ii) a corresponding liability of the other (the **_other party_**).

    * (3) The 2 entities are either:

     * (a) the first entity and the other entity (see subsection 85530(3)), if table item 2 in subsection 85530(4) applies to those entities; or

     * (b) both:

       * (i) that first entity or that other entity; and

       * (ii) an entity that is a first entity or other entity for the purposes of a related application of subsection 85530(3) and table item 2 in subsection 85530(4).

    * (4) Disregard:

     * (a) if the other party is the test entity (see subsection 85530(2))--the asset's *market value; or

     * (b) otherwise--the percentage of the asset's market value equal to the percentage that is the test entity's *total participation interest in the other party.

         * Example: The test entity loans money to its whollyowned subsidiary. The market value of the loan asset created as an asset of the test entity is disregarded for the purposes of subsection 85530(2).

##### 85535  Reducing a capital gain or loss from a business asset--Australian permanent establishments

    * (1) This section applies to a *CGT asset that is *taxable Australian property under item 3 of the table in section 85515 because you have used it at any time in carrying on a *business through a permanent establishment (as mentioned in that item) in .

    * (2) The *capital gain or *capital loss you make from a *CGT event in relation to the asset is reduced if you used it in this way for only part of the period from when you *acquired it to when the CGT event happened.

    * (3) The gain or loss is reduced by this fraction:

##### 85540  Capital gains and losses of foreign residents through fixed trusts

    * (1) The purpose of this section is to provide comparable taxation treatment as between direct ownership, and indirect ownership through a *fixed trust, by foreign residents of *CGT assets that are not *taxable Australian property.

    * (2) A *capital gain you make in respect of your interest in a *fixed trust is disregarded if:

     * (a) you are a foreign resident when you make the gain; and

     * (b) the gain is attributable to a *CGT event happening to a *CGT asset of a trust (the **_CGT event trust_**) that is:

       * (i) the *fixed trust; or

       * (ii) another fixed trust in which that trust has an interest (directly, or indirectly through a *chain of trusts, each trust in which is a fixed trust); and

     * (c) either:

       * (i) the asset is not *taxable Australian property for the CGT event trust at the time of the CGT event; or

       * (ii) the asset is an interest in a fixed trust and the conditions in subsections (5), (6), (7) and (8) are satisfied.

          * Note: Section 115215 treats a portion of a trust's capital gain as a capital gain made by a beneficiary, and applies the CGT discount to that portion as if the gain were made directly by the beneficiary.

    * (3) You are not liable to pay tax as a trustee of a *fixed trust in respect of an amount to the extent that the amount gives rise to a *capital gain that is disregarded for a beneficiary under subsection (2).

    * (4) To avoid doubt, subsection (3) does not affect the operation of subsection 98A(1) or (3) of the _Income Tax Assessment Act 1936_ (about taxing beneficiaries who are foreign residents at the end of an income year).

    * Conditions

    * (5) The conditions in subsections (6), (7) and (8) must be satisfied if the relevant *CGT event happens to an interest in a *fixed trust (the **_first trust_**) and the interest is *taxable Australian property at the time of the CGT event.

    * (6) At least 90% (by *market value) of the *CGT assets of:

     * (a) the first trust; or

     * (b) a *fixed trust in which the first trust has an interest (directly, or indirectly through a *chain of trusts, each trust in which is a fixed trust);

    * must not be *taxable Australian property at the time of the relevant *CGT event.

    * (7) If the condition in subsection (6) is not satisfied for the first trust (but is satisfied for a trust covered by paragraph (6)(b)), the condition in subsection (8) must be satisfied for the first trust, and for each other trust in the *chain of trusts between the first trust and the trust that satisfied the condition in subsection (6).

    * (8) The condition is that, assuming any interest in a *fixed trust in that *chain not to be *taxable Australian property, at least 90% (by *market value) of the *CGT assets of the trust must not be taxable Australian property.

    * (3) Also, Parts 31 and 33 apply to the asset as if you had *acquired it at the time you became an Australian resident.

    * (4) This section does not apply to an *ESS interest if:

     * (a) Subdivision 83C (about employee share schemes) applies to the interest; and

     * (b) the *ESS deferred taxing point for the interest has not yet occurred.

##### 85550  Trust becomes a resident trust

    * (1) If a trust becomes a *resident trust for CGT purposes, there are rules relevant to each *CGT asset that the trustee owned just before the trust became a resident trust for CGT purposes, except one:

     * (a) that is *taxable Australian property; or

     * (b) that the trustee *acquired before 20 September 1985.

    * (2) The first element of the *cost base and *reduced cost base of the asset (at the time the trust becomes a *resident trust for CGT purposes) is its *market value at that time.

    * (3) The modifications of Parts 31 and 33 of this Act in sections 411 to 414 of the _Income Tax Assessment Act 1936_ have the effect they would have, in relation to each *commencing day asset owned by the *CFC at the residence change time, if those modifications were used to work out the taxable income of the CFC rather than its *attributable income.

    * (4) However, if a *capital gain on a *commencing day asset of the *CFC (for a period before the residence change time) was *subject to foreign tax in a *listed country, the modifications of Parts 31 and 33 of this Act in sections 411 to 414 of the _Income Tax Assessment Act 1936_ have the effect they would have in relation to the asset if:

     * (a) those modifications were used to work out the taxable income of the CFC rather than its *attributable income; and

     * (b) the *commencing day of the CFC were the residence change time.

         * Note: This section is disregarded in calculating the attributable income of a CFC: see section 410 of the _Income Tax Assessment Act 1936_.

     * (b) that are losses or outgoings for accommodation or for food or drink, or are incidental to the travel.

    * The travel may be within or outside .

         * Note: This Division also applies to individuals who are not employees: see section 90012.

    * Meal allowance expenses included

    * (4) Meal allowance expenses count as *work expenses. A **_meal allowance expense_** is a loss or outgoing that you incur for food or drink that is covered by a *meal allowance.

    * (5) A **_meal allowance_** is an allowance that your employer pays or is to pay to you as an employee to enable you to buy food or drink. However, an allowance is not a meal allowance if it is a *travel allowance or part of one.

         * Note: This Division also applies to individuals who are not employees: see section 90012.

    * Motor vehicle expenses excluded

    * (6) A loss or outgoing to do with a *motor vehicle is not treated as a *work expense unless it is:

     * (a) a loss or outgoing incurred, or a payment made, in respect of travel outside ; or

     * (b) a taxi fare or similar loss or outgoing.

    * However, most losses or outgoings to do with a *motor vehicle are covered by the rules about *car expenses. See Division 28 and Subdivision 900C.

    * Other types of losses or outgoings included

    * (7) In addition to losses or outgoings within the general scope of subsection (1), any of the following is a *work expense:

     * (a) the decline in value of property you own and that is used, or is *installed ready for use, by you in order to produce your salary or wages;

     * (b) expenditure you incur that qualifies as a deduction under section 2560 (Parliament election expenses) or section 2565 (about local government election expenses);

     * (c) expenditure you incur that entitles you to a deduction under section 25100 (transport expenses incurred in your travel between workplaces), other than *car expenses.

         * Note 1: This Division also applies to payments that are _not_ salary or wages, but _are_ PAYE earnings: see section 90012.

         * Note 2: In certain circumstances (for example, under a hire purchase agreement) the notional buyer of property is taken to be its owner (see subsection 24020(2)).

         * Note 3: See Subdivision 900C for car expenses that are also transport expenses incurred in your travel between workplaces.

##### 90035  Exception for small total of expenses

    * (1) If the total of all the *work expenses (including *laundry expenses, but excluding *travel allowance expenses and *meal allowance expenses) that you want to deduct is $300 or less, you can deduct them without getting written evidence or keeping travel records.

         * Note 1: If the total is more than $300, you need to substantiate _all_ the work expenses, not just the excess over $300.

         * Note 2: Whether or not your work expenses total $300 or less, for certain expenses that are each $10 or less and total $200 or less you can get written evidence by making your own record, instead of getting a document from the supplier: see section 900125.

    * (2) This limit can be increased from time to time by regulations made under section 9091.

    * (3) A *transport expense that Subdivision 900I (Award transport payments) lets you deduct without following the rules in this Division does not count towards this limit.

##### 90040  Exception for laundry expenses below a certain limit

    * (1) Even if the *work expenses you claim total more than $300, you can still deduct up to $150 of *laundry expenses without getting written evidence of them.

    * (2) However, this exception does not increase the $300 limit in section 90035 to $450: your *laundry expenses still count toward that limit.

         * Example: You want to deduct laundry expenses of $140 and union dues of $200. These work expenses total more than $300, so the exception in section 90035 doesn't apply. This means you must substantiate the union dues expense. However, because of the exception in this section, you don't need to get written evidence of the laundry expenses.

    * (3) This limit can be increased from time to time by regulations made under section 9091.

    * (4) A **_laundry expense_** is a *work expense to do with washing, drying or ironing clothes (but not dry cleaning).

##### 90045  Exception for work expense related to award transport payment

    * You may be able to deduct, without getting written evidence or keeping travel records, a *transport expense you incurred that is related to an allowance or reimbursement paid or payable to you by your employer under an *industrial instrument that was in force on 29 October 1986. Subdivision 900I tells you about this.

         * Note: This Division also applies to entities that are _not_ employers, but pay (or are liable to pay) withholding payments covered by subsection 90012(3).

##### 90050  Exception for domestic travel allowance expenses

    * (1) You can deduct a *travel allowance expense for travel within Australia without getting written evidence or keeping travel records if the Commissioner considers reasonable the total of the losses or outgoings you claim for travel covered by the allowance.

    * (2) In deciding whether the total of the losses or outgoings you claim is reasonable, the Commissioner must take into account the total of the losses or outgoings of the following kinds that it would be reasonable for you to incur for the travel:

     * (a) accommodation;

     * (b) food or drink;

     * (c) losses or outgoings incidental to the travel.

##### 90055  Exception for overseas travel allowance expenses

    * (1) You can deduct a *travel allowance expense for travel outside  without getting written evidence under the same conditions as for domestic *travel allowances, except that you still have to get written evidence for losses or outgoings for accommodation.

    * (2) Consequently, in deciding whether the total of the losses or outgoings you claim is reasonable, the Commissioner must disregard losses or outgoings for accommodation.

    * (3) However, for overseas travel covered by a *travel allowance you must still keep travel records if the travel involves you being away from your ordinary residence for 6 or more nights in a row: Subdivision 900F tells you about travel records.

##### 90060  Exception for reasonable overtime meal allowance

    * You can deduct a *meal allowance expense without getting written evidence if:

     * (a) the allowance is to enable you to buy food or drink in connection with overtime that you work; and

     * (b) the allowance is paid or payable to you under an *industrial instrument; and

     * (c) the Commissioner considers reasonable the total of the losses or outgoings you claim that are covered by the allowance.

##### 90065  Crew members on international flights need not keep travel records

    * You can deduct a *travel allowance expense without keeping travel records if:

     * (a) the allowance covers travel by you as a crew member of an aircraft; and 

     * (b) the travel is principally outside ; and

     * (c) the total of the losses or outgoings you claim for the travel that are covered by the allowance does not exceed the allowance.

##### Subdivision 900C--Substantiating car expenses

##### Table of sections

      * 90070	Getting written evidence

      * 90075	Retaining the written evidence and odometer records

##### 90070  Getting written evidence

    * (1) For the "onethird of actual expenses" method or the "log book" method of deducting a *car expense, you need to substantiate the expense by getting written evidence. Subdivision 900E tells you about the evidence you need.

    * Subdivision 28E tells you about the "onethird of actual expenses" method and Subdivision 28F tells you about the "log book" method.

    * (2) If you are using the "onethird of actual expenses" method and your expense is for fuel or oil, you have a choice of either:

     * (a) getting written evidence of it under Subdivision 900E; or

     * (b) keeping odometer records for the period when you owned or leased the *car in the income year.

    * Subdivision 28H tells you about odometer records.

         * Note: In certain circumstances (for example, under a hire purchase agreement) the notional buyer of property is taken to be its owner (see subsection 24020(2)).

    * (3) If you are using the "log book" method and your expense is for fuel or oil, you do not need to get written evidence of it, because section 28100 already requires you to keep odometer records for the period when you *held the *car in the income year.

##### 90075  Retaining the written evidence and odometer records

    * (1) Once you have the material required by this Subdivision, you must retain it for 5 years. There is no need to lodge it with your *income tax return. The Commissioner may require you to produce it: see Subdivision 900G. The period for which you must retain it is called the **_retention period_**.

    * (2) The 5 years start on the due day for lodging your *income tax return for the income year. If you lodge your return later, the 5 years start on the day you lodge it.

    * (3) However, the *retention period is extended if, when the 5 years end, you are involved in a dispute with the Commissioner that relates to the expense. See section 900170.

    * (4) If you do not retain the material for the *retention period, you cannot deduct the expense. If you have already deducted it, your assessment may be amended to disallow the deduction.

    * (5) If you lose any of the material, there are rules that might help you in section 900205.

##### _90080  Getting written evidence

    * (1) To deduct a *business travel expense:

     * (a) it must qualify as a deduction under some provision of this Act outside this Division; and

     * (b) you need to substantiate it by getting written evidence. 

    * Subdivision 900E tells you about the evidence you need.

         * To find out whether an expense qualifies as a deduction under this Act, see Division 8 (Deductions).

    * (2) If your expense is for fuel or oil, you have a choice of either:

     * (a) getting written evidence of it under Subdivision 900E; or

     * (b) keeping odometer records for the period when you owned or leased the *car in the income year.

    * Subdivision 28H tells you about odometer records.

         * Note: In certain circumstances (for example, under a hire purchase agreement) the notional buyer of property is taken to be its owner (see subsection 24020(2)).

##### 90085  Keeping travel records

    * You need to keep travel records if your expense is for travel that involves you being away from your ordinary residence for 6 or more nights in a row. Subdivision 900F tells you about travel records.

##### 90090  Retaining the written evidence and travel records

    * (1) Once you have the material required by section 90080 or 90085, you must retain it for 5 years. There is no need to lodge it with your *income tax return. The Commissioner may require you to produce it: see Subdivision 900G. The period for which you must retain it is called the **_retention period_**.

    * (2) The 5 years start on the due day for lodging your *income tax return for the income year. If you lodge your return later, the 5 years start on the day you lodge it.

    * (3) However, the *retention period is extended if, when the 5 years end, you are involved in a dispute with the Commissioner that relates to the expense. See section 900170.

    * (4) If you do not retain the material for the *retention period, you cannot deduct the expense. If you have already deducted it, your assessment may be amended to disallow the deduction.

    * (5) If you lose any of the material, there are rules that might help you in section 900205.

##### 90095  Meaning of business travel expense

    * General

    * (1) A **_business travel expense_** is a *travel expense, in so far as you incur it in producing your assessable income other than salary or wages.

    * Travel expense

    * (2) A loss or outgoing is a **_travel expense_** if you incur it for travel by you that involves you being away from your ordinary residence for at least one night. The travel may be within or outside .

    * Salary and wages travel expenses excluded

    * (3) In so far as you incur *travel expenses in producing your salary or wages, the expenses are not treated as *business travel expenses. Instead, they are dealt with as *work expenses in Subdivision 900B.

         * Note: This Division also applies to withholding payments that are not salary or wages: see subsection 90012(3).

    * Travel allowance expenses excluded

    * (4) *Travel allowance expenses are not treated as *business travel expenses. They too are dealt with as *work expenses in Subdivision 900B.

    * Motor vehicle expenses excluded

    * (5) A loss or outgoing to do with a *motor vehicle is not treated as a *business travel expense unless it is:

     * (a) a loss or outgoing incurred, or a payment made, in respect of travel outside ; or

     * (b) a taxi fare or similar loss or outgoing.

    * However, most *motor vehicle expenses are covered by the rules about *car expenses. See Division 28 and Subdivision 900C.

##### Subdivision 900E--Written evidence

##### Guide to Subdivision 900E

##### 900100  What this Subdivision is about

    * This Subdivision tells you how you must get written evidence to support a claim for a deduction.

##### Table of sections

  * Operative provisions

      * 900105	Ways of getting written evidence

      * 900110	Time limits

      * 900115	Written evidence from supplier

      * 900120	Written evidence of depreciating asset expense

      * 900125	Evidence of small expenses

      * 900130	Evidence of expenses considered otherwise too hard to substantiate

      * 900135	Evidence on a payment summary

##### Operative provisions

##### 900105  Ways of getting written evidence

    * Each of the following sections has a set of rules for a particular way of getting written evidence to substantiate a deduction. Which ones you can use depends on the type of expense. You only need to use one set of rules to support an expense.

##### 900110  Time limits

    * (1) There is no time limit for getting written evidence of an expense (unless you want to record the expense yourself under section 900125 or 900130). But until you get written evidence of it, you are not entitled to a deduction for the expense.

    * (2) If when you lodge your *income tax return for the income year you have good reason to expect to get written evidence of the expense within a reasonable time, you can deduct the expense without actually getting the evidence. But if you don't get the evidence within a reasonable time, your entitlement to the deduction ceases. If you have already deducted the expense, your assessment may be amended to disallow the deduction.

    * (3) Even if you only get written evidence of the expense _after_ the end of the income year, you deduct the expense for that income year, not the income year in which you get the evidence.

##### 900115  Written evidence from supplier

    * (1) You may use this set of rules for any type of expense except the decline in value of a *depreciating asset.

    * (2) You must get a document from the supplier of the goods or services the expense is for. The document must set out:

     * (a) the name or business name of the supplier; and 

     * (b) the amount of the expense, expressed in the currency in which it was incurred; and

     * (c) the nature of the goods or services; and

     * (d) the day the expense was incurred; and

     * (e) the day it is made out.

    * (3) There are 2 exceptions to these requirements:

     * (a) if the document does not show the day the expense was incurred, you may use a bank statement or other reasonable, independent evidence that shows when it was paid;

     * (b) if the document the supplier gave you does not specify the nature of the goods or services, you may write in the missing details yourself before you lodge your *income tax return for the income year.

    * (4) The document must be in English. However, if the expense was incurred in a country outside , the document can instead be in a language of that country.

##### 900120  Written evidence of depreciating asset expense

    * (1) You may use this set of rules only for a *depreciating asset expense.

    * (2) You must get evidence of the original acquisition of the *depreciating asset. It must be a document that you get from the supplier of the asset and that specifies:

     * (a) the name or business name of the supplier; and 

     * (b) the cost of the asset to you; and

     * (c) the nature of the asset; and

     * (d) the day you acquired the asset; and

     * (e) the day it is made out.

    * (3) However, if the document the supplier gave you does not specify the nature of the asset, you may write in the missing details yourself before you lodge your *income tax return for the income year in which you first claim a deduction for the decline in value of the asset.

    * (4) If you don't get the document in time, for example because you only decided to use the asset for incomeproducing purposes several years after you acquired it, there are rules that might help you in Subdivision 900H (Relief from effects of failing to substantiate).

    * (5) The document must be in English. However, if you *imported the asset into , the document can instead be in a language of the country from which the asset was originally exported.

##### 900125  Evidence of small expenses

    * (1) If your expense is small, and you have a small total of small expenses, you can make a record of the expenses instead of getting a document from the supplier.

    * (2) Each expense must be $10 or less, and the total of all your expenses that:

     * (a) are each $10 or less; and

     * (b) you incurred in the income year and wish to deduct; and

     * (c) you must get written evidence for under this Division;

    * must be $200 or less. These limits can be increased from time to time by regulations made under section 9091.

    * (3) If the expense is not the decline in value of a *depreciating asset, you must get a document with the same information as required by section 900115, except that you may create the document and record all the details yourself. You must do so as soon as possible after incurring the expense.

    * (4) If the expense is the decline in value of a *depreciating asset, you must, as soon as possible after the last day of the income year, record in a document the following:

     * (a) the nature of the property;

     * (b) the amount of the decline in value;

     * (c) who made the record;

     * (d) the day the record is made.

    * (5) A record must be in English.

##### 900130  Evidence of expenses considered otherwise too hard to substantiate

    * (1) If the Commissioner considers it unreasonable to expect you to have got written evidence of an expense in any other way permitted by this Subdivision, you can use the method in section 900125 to get written evidence of your claim.

    * (2) The expense may be more than $10 and does not count towards the $200 limit in section 900125.

##### 900135  Evidence on a payment summary

    * (1) If the nature and amount of a *work expense are shown on your copy of a *payment summary given to you by your employer, you can use the copy as written evidence of the expense.

         * Note: This Division also applies to entities that are _not_ employers, but pay (or are liable to pay) withholding payments covered by subsection 90012(3).

    * (2) Expenses of the same nature need not be separately itemised; it is acceptable if they are totalled together on the *payment summary.

##### Subdivision 900F--Travel records

##### Guide to Subdivision 900F

##### 900140  What this Subdivision is about

    * This Subdivision tells you how to keep travel records. A travel record is a record of activities you undertake during your travel.

##### Table of sections

      * 900145	Purpose of a travel record

  * Operative provisions

      * 900150	Recording activities in travel records

      * 900155	Showing which of your activities were incomeproducing activities

##### 900145  Purpose of a travel record

    * The purpose of a travel record is to show which of your activities were undertaken in the course of producing your assessable income, so that your losses or outgoings, or portions of them, can be attributed to incomeproducing purposes.

##### Operative provisions

##### 900150  Recording activities in travel records

    * (1) You record an activity by specifying in a diary or similar document:

     * (a) the nature of the activity;

     * (b) the day and approximate time when it began;

     * (c) how long it lasted;

     * (d) where you engaged in it.

    * (2) An activity must be recorded before it ends, or as soon as possible afterwards. Each entry must be in English.

##### 900155  Showing which of your activities were incomeproducing activities

    * (1) You need not record an incomeproducing activity. But if you don't, the activity cannot be taken into account in working out the extent to which you can deduct an expense you incur for the travel.

         * Example: If you fly to  for the sole purpose of attending a 7 day conference, but you don't record the conference in your travel record, you cannot deduct the cost of the air fare. This is so even if you have written evidence that you paid the fare (eg a receipt), as required by Subdivision 900E.

    * (2) You don't need to record any other kind of activity, although you may do so.

##### Subdivision 900G--Retaining and producing records

##### Operative provisions

##### 900170  Extending the retention period if an expense is disputed

    * The *retention period is automatically extended if one of the following types of dispute relating to the expense is unresolved when the 5 years end:

     * (a) an objection; 

     * (b) a review or appeal arising from an objection;

     * (c) a request for amendment of an assessment.

    * The extension lasts until the dispute is resolved.

##### 900175  Commissioner may tell you to produce your records

    * (1) The Commissioner may give you a written notice telling you to produce records of expenses specified in the notice. The records must be ones that you have to retain for the *retention period: you do not have to produce records if the retention period for those records is over.

    * (2) The notice must give you 28 days or more to comply, starting on the day after the notice is given. The Commissioner may allow you more time to comply with the notice.

##### 900180  How to comply with a notice

    * (1) To comply with the notice, you must produce to the Commissioner, for each of the expenses, the material that this Division or Division 28 requires you to retain during the *retention period.

    * (2) You must also produce a summary that, for each expense for which you produce written evidence (see Subdivision 900E):

     * (a) notes the expense; and

     * (b) has a crossreference to the written evidence of the expense; and

     * (c) summarises the particulars set out in the written evidence; and

     * (d) if the expense was in a foreign currency--shows the amount of the expense in Australian currency.

    * The summary must be in English in a form approved by the Commissioner.

##### 900185  What happens if you don't comply

    * (1) If you do not comply with a notice for a particular expense, you cannot deduct the expense. If you have already deducted it, your assessment may be amended to disallow the deduction.

    * (2) You do not commit an offence merely by not complying with the notice, despite section 8C of the _Taxation Administration Act 1953_.

##### Subdivision 900H--Relief from effects of failing to substantiate

##### Table of sections

      * 900195	Commissioner's discretion to review failure to substantiate

      * 900200	Reasonable expectation that substantiation would not be required

      * 900205	What if your documents are lost or destroyed?

##### 900195  Commissioner's discretion to review failure to substantiate

    * Not doing something necessary to follow the rules in this Division does not affect your right to a deduction if the nature and quality of the evidence you have to substantiate your claim satisfies the Commissioner: 

     * (a) that you incurred the expense; and

     * (b) that you are entitled to deduct the amount you claim.

##### 900200  Reasonable expectation that substantiation would not be required

    * Not doing something necessary to follow the rules in this Division does not affect your right to deduct an amount if the only reason was that you had a reasonable expectation that you would not need to do it in order to be able to deduct that amount.

##### 900205  What if your documents are lost or destroyed?

    * (1) If you have a _complete copy _of a document that is lost or destroyed during the *retention period, it is treated as the original from the time of the loss or destruction. 

    * (2) If you don't have such a copy, but the Commissioner is satisfied that you took reasonable precautions to prevent the loss or destruction, the rest of this section explains what to do.

    * (3) If the lost or destroyed document was a travel record, log book or other document that is _not_ written evidence of an expense under Subdivision 900E, you do not need to replace it; your deduction is not affected by your failing to retain or produce the document.

    * (4) If the lost or destroyed document _was_ written evidence, you must try to get a substitute document that meets all the original requirements (except the time limit for getting the original).

    * (5) If you succeed, your deduction is not affected by your failing to retain or produce the original document. The substitute document is treated as the original from the time of the loss or destruction.

    * (6) If it is not reasonably possible to succeed, your deduction is not affected by your failing to retain or produce the original document.

    * (7) If it is reasonably possible for you to get a substitute document, but you don't get one, this section does not protect you from the consequences of failing to retain or produce the original.

     * (c) those transport expenses qualify as a deduction under some provision of this Act outside this Division;

    * then you can deduct those transport expenses without getting written evidence or keeping travel records.

         * To find out whether an expense qualifies as a deduction under this Act, see Division 8 (Deductions).

    * Increases to amounts payable under industrial instrument must be ignored

    * (2) For each *award transport payment, you can deduct no more than the amount you could have deducted if the *industrial instrument the payment is under were still in force as it was on 29 October 1986. If your claim exceeds this amount, you cannot use the exception for the expenses.

##### 900220  Definition of award transport payment

    * Award transport payment

    * (1) An **_award transport payment _**is a *transport payment covering particular travel that was paid under an *industrial instrument that was in force on 29 October 1986.

    * Transport payment

    * (2) A **_transport payment_** is an amount your employer pays you, or is to pay you, for travel by you in the course of working for the employer that is:

     * (a) an allowance (or part of an allowance) for the sole or main purpose of covering your *transport expenses; or

     * (b) a reimbursement to which section 1570 applies that is for the whole or a part of a *car expense. However, an amount is not a **_transport payment_** if it is, or is part of, a *travel allowance.

         * Note: This Division also applies to entities that are _not_ employers, but pay (or are liable to pay) withholding payments covered by subsection 90012(3).

    * Transport expense

    * (3) A **_transport expense _**is a loss or outgoing to do with transport, including the decline in value of a *depreciating asset used in connection with transport, but not including a loss or outgoing for accommodation or for food or drink, or expenditure incidental to transport.

##### 900225  Substituted industrial instruments

    * An *industrial instrument that comes into force in substitution for another industrial instrument is taken to be a continuation of the original instrument.

##### 900230  Changes to industrial instruments applied for before 29 October 1986

    * (1) Changes made to an *industrial instrument after 29 October 1986 are taken to have been made on 29 October 1986 if they were made in response to an application made on or before 29 October 1986 that sought increases in *transport payments.

    * (2) If the application was amended after 29 October 1986, the alterations made to the *industrial instrument count as being made on 29 October 1986 only if they did not result in increases in *transport payments that were greater than increases in those payments sought by the application as at 29 October 1986.

##### 900235  Changes to industrial instruments solely referable to matters in the instrument

    * Changes made to an *industrial instrument after 29 October 1986 are taken to have been made on 29 October 1986 if the whole amount of the change is determined solely by reference to matters that were contained in the industrial instrument on 29 October 1986.

##### 900240  Deducting in anticipation of receiving award transport payment

    * If: 

     * (a) you have incurred a *transport expense during an income year; and

     * (b) when you lodge your *income tax return for the income year, you reasonably believe that you will later receive an *award transport payment to cover the expense;

    * you may deduct the expense without getting written evidence or keeping travel records.

##### 900245  Effect of exception in this Subdivision on exception for small total of expenses

    * A *transport expense that section 900215 lets you deduct without getting written evidence or keeping travel records does not count towards the $300 limit in section 90035.

         * Note: Section 90035 tells you that if the total of all the work expenses that you want to deduct is $300 or less, you can deduct them without getting written evidence or keeping travel records.

##### 900250  Effect of exception in this Subdivision on methods of calculating car expense deductions

    * (1) If the exception in this Subdivision lets you deduct, without getting written evidence or keeping travel records, losses or outgoings (**_exempt losses or outgoings_**) that are or include *car expenses, or parts of *car expenses, your use of the 4 methods for calculating deductions for car expenses for the *car is affected.

    * You may elect not to use the exception

    * (2) However, if you do not want your use of the 4 methods to be affected, you may elect not to use the exception in this Subdivision for the *award transport payments you are paid in the income year. If you so elect, the rest of this section does not affect you.

    * "Cents per kilometre" method

    * (3) You can still use the "cents per kilometre" method (see Subdivision 28C) of deducting *car expenses you incurred for the *car in the income year. However, the kilometres the car travelled during the income year in the course of travel covered by the *award transport payment or payments are not counted as *business kilometres.

    * "12% of original value" and "onethird of actual expenses" methods

    * (4) You cannot use the "12% of original value" method (see Subdivision 28D) or the "onethird of actual expenses" method (see Subdivision 28E) of deducting *car expenses you incurred for the *car in the income year.

    * "Log book" method

    * (5) You can still use the "log book" method (see Subdivision 28F) of deducting *car expenses you incurred for the *car in the income year. If you do:

     * (a) the kilometres the car travelled during the income year in the course of travel covered by the *award transport payment or payments are not counted as *business kilometres; and

     * (b) in working out the amount (if any) you can deduct for such a car expense that consists partly of an exempt loss or outgoing, Subdivision 28F is applied to the whole of the car expense, without excluding the part that consists of an exempt loss or outgoing.

##### Subdivision 960E--Entities

##### Table of sections

      * 960100	Entities

      * 960105	Certain entities treated as agents

##### 960100  Entities

    * (1) **_Entity_** means any of the following:

     * (a) an individual;

     * (b) a body corporate;

     * (c) a body politic;

     * (d) a partnership;

     * (e) any other unincorporated association or body of persons;

     * (f) a trust;

     * (g) a *superannuation fund;

         * Note: The term **_entity_** is used in a number of different but related senses. It covers all kinds of legal person. It also covers groups of legal persons, and other things, that in practice are treated as having a separate identity in the same way as a legal person does. 

    * (1A) Paragraph (1)(e) does not include a *nonentity joint venture.

    * (2) The trustee of a trust, of a *superannuation fund or of an *approved deposit fund is taken to be an **_entity_** consisting of the person who is the trustee, or the persons who are the trustees, at any given time.

         * Note 1: This is because a right or obligation cannot be conferred or imposed on an entity that is not a legal person.

         * Note 2: The entity that is the trustee of a trust or fund does not change merely because of a change in the person who is the trustee of the trust or fund, or persons who are the trustees of the trust or fund.

          *  	sole trustee of one or more trusts; and

          *  	one of a number of trustees of a further trust.

         * In his or her personal capacity, he or she is one entity. As trustee of each trust, he or she is a different entity. The trustees of the further trust are a different entity again, of which the individual is a member.

    * (4) If a provision refers to an **_entity_** of a particular kind, it refers to the entity in its capacity as that kind of entity, not to that entity in any other capacity.

         * Example: A provision that refers to a company does not cover a company in a capacity as trustee, unless it also refers to a trustee.

         * Note: Under section 8735, certain parts of Australian governments and authorities are treated as separate entities for the purposes of ascertaining whether another entity is conducting a personal services business.

##### 960105  Certain entities treated as agents

    * (1) This Act applies to an entity as if the entity were an agent of another entity (the **_principal_**) if:

     * (a) the principal is outside ; and

     * (b) the entity is in  and, on behalf of the principal, holds money of the principal or has control, receipt or disposal of money of the principal.

    * (2) This Act, or a provision of this Act, applies to an entity as if the entity were an agent of another entity if the Commissioner determines in writing that the entity is the agent or sole agent of the other entity for the purposes of this Act or of that provision.

    * (3) A determination under subsection (2) is not a legislative instrument.

##### Table of sections

      * 960115	Meaning of _corporate tax entity_

      * _960120	Meaning of _distribution_

##### _960115  Meaning of corporate tax entity

    * An entity is a **_corporate tax entity _**at a particular time if:

     * (a) the entity is a company at that time; or

     * (b) the entity is a *corporate limited partnership in relation to the income year in which that time occurs; or

     * (c) the entity is a *corporate unit trust in relation to the income year in which that time occurs; or

     * (d) the entity is a *public trading trust in relation to the income year in which that time occurs.

##### 960120  Meaning of distribution

    * (1) What constitutes a **_distribution_** by various *corporate tax entities is set out in the following table:

    * (2) A *corporate tax entity **_makes a distribution_** in the form of a dividend on the day on which the dividend is paid, or taken to have been paid.

##### Subdivision 960G--Membership of entities

##### Table of sections

      * 960130	Members of entities

      * 960135	Membership interest in an entity

      * 960140	Ordinary membership interest

##### 960130  Members of entities

    * (1) The following table sets out who is a **_member _**of various entities.

    * (2) If 2 or more entities jointly hold interests or rights that give rise to membership of another entity, each of them is a **_member_** of the other entity.

    * (3) An entity is _not_ a **_member_** of another entity just because the entity holds one or more interests or rights relating to the other entity that are *debt interests. This subsection has effect despite subsections (1) and (2) of this section.

         * Example: An entity is _not_ a member of a company as defined in this section merely because it is a member of the company in the ordinary sense of the term because it holds a finance share in the company, if the finance share is a debt interest. However, if the entity holds other shares in the company that are not debt interests, it will be a member because of those other shares.

##### 960135  Membership interest in an entity

    * If you are a *member of an entity:

     * (a) each interest, or set of interests, in the entity; or

     * (b) each right, or set of rights, in relation to the entity;

    * by virtue of which you are a member of the entity is a **_membership interest _**of yours in the entity.

         * Note: In conjunction with subsection 960130(3), this means that a debt interest is _not_ a membership interest.

         * Example: A member of a company holds a finance share in a company that is a debt interest and some other shares in the company that are not debt interests. Only the other shares are membership interests in the company. The finance share is not, because the member is not a member of the company because of that share (see subsection 960130(3)).

##### 960140  Ordinary membership interest

    * A *membership interest in a *corporate tax entity is an **_ordinary membership interest _**if:

     * (a) in the case of a membership interest in a company--it is an ordinary share; and

     * (b) in the case of a membership interest in a *corporate limited partnership--it is an interest in the income of the partnership; and

     * (c) in the case of a membership interest in a *corporate unit trust or *public trading trust--it is a unit in the trust.

     * (b) the entity's *indirect participation interest in the other entity at that time.

##### 960185  Indirect participation interest

    * (1) Work out the **_indirect participation interest_** that an entity (the **_holding entity_**) holds at a particular time in another entity (the **_test entity_**) by multiplying:

     * (a) the holding entity's *direct participation interest (if any) in another entity (the **_intermediate entity_**) at that time;

    * by: 

     * (b) the sum of:

       * (i) the intermediate entity's direct participation interest (if any) in the test entity at that time; and

       * (ii) the intermediate entity's indirect participation interest (if any) in the test entity at that time (as worked out under one or more other applications of this section).

    * (2) If there is more than one intermediate entity to which paragraph (1)(a) applies at that time, the holding entity's **_indirect participation interest _**is the sum of the percentages worked out under subsection (1) in relation to each of those intermediate entities.

##### 960190  Direct participation interest

    * (1) Use the following table to work out the **_direct participation interest_** that one entity holds in another entity.

    * (2) For the purposes of subsection (1):

     * (a) apply sections 350 and 351 of the _Income Tax Assessment Act 1936_ as if those sections apply for the purposes of this Division rather than only for the purposes of Part X of that Act; and

     * (b) do not apply subsections 350(6) and (7) and 351(3) and (4) of that Act.

    * (3) For the purposes of item 3 of the table in subsection (1), assume that:

     * (a) the *partnership is a company; and

     * (b) the partners in the partnership are shareholders in the company; and

     * (c) the total amount of assets or capital contributed to the partnership is the total paidup share capital of the company; and

     * (d) a partner's right of distribution of capital, assets or profits on the dissolution of the partnership is a shareholder's right to distribution of capital or profits of the company on windingup; and

     * (e) a partner's right of distribution of capital, assets or profits otherwise than on the dissolution of the partnership is a shareholder's right to distribution of capital or profits of the company otherwise than on windingup.

##### 960195  Nonportfolio interest test

    * An interest held by an entity (the **_holding entity_**) in another entity (the **_test entity_**) passes the nonportfolio interest test at a time if the sum of the *direct participation interests held by the holding entity and its *associates in the test entity at that time is 10% or more.

##### 960225  Abnormal trading

    * (1) There is an **_abnormal trading_** in *shares in a company, or in units in a unit trust, if a *trading in the shares or units is abnormal having regard to all relevant factors, including these:

     * (a) the timing of the trading, when compared with the normal timing for trading in the company's shares or in the trust's units;

     * (b) the number of shares or units traded, when compared with the normal number of the company's shares, or the trust's units, traded;

##### Subdivision 960J--Family relationships

##### Guide to Subdivision 960J

##### 960250  What this Subdivision is about

    * This Subdivision has 2 principles for defining family relationships.

    * The first principle is to treat an unmarried couple (whether of the same sex or different sexes) in the same way as a married couple if:

         * (a) their relationship is registered under particular State or Territory laws; or

         * (b) they live together on a genuine domestic basis.

    * The second principle is to treat anyone who is defined to be an individual's child in the same way as the individual's natural child would be treated.

    * Both principles extend to tracing other family relationships, including beyond couples and children and their parents.

##### Table of sections

  * Operative provisions

      * 960252	Object of this Subdivision

      * 960255	Family relationships

##### Operative provisions

##### 960252  Object of this Subdivision

    * (1) The first object of this Subdivision is to ensure that the same consequences flow under this Act and the other Acts to which this Subdivision applies from the relationship between 2 people who are an unmarried couple (whether of the same sex or different sexes) as from a marriage, if:

     * (a) the relationship is registered under a *State law or *Territory law (as mentioned in paragraph (a) of the definition of **_spouse _**in subsection 9951(1)); or

     * (b) they live together on a genuine domestic basis.

    * (2) The second object of this Subdivision is to ensure that under this Act and the other Acts to which this Subdivision applies, anyone who is defined to be an individual's *child is treated in the same way as if he or she were the individual's natural child.

##### 960255  Family relationships

    * Relationships between couples

    * (1) If one individual is the *spouse of another individual because of the definition of **_spouse _**in subsection 9951(1), relationships traced to, from or through the individual, and family groups of which either individual is a member, are to be determined in the same way as if the individual were legally married to the other individual.

         * Example: George and Angelika are not legally married but live together on a genuine domestic basis in a relationship as a couple. This Act treats them as part of each other's family.

    * Relationships involving children

    * (2) If one individual is the *child of another individual because of the definition of **_child _**in subsection 9951(1), relationships traced to, from or through the individual, and family groups of which either individual is a member, are to be determined in the same way as if the individual were the natural child of the other individual.

         * Example: Clare's stepfather Frank has a sister Angela. This Act applies as if Angela were Clare's aunt because Clare is defined to be Frank's child. That is, Clare's relationship to Angela is determined on the basis that Clare is Frank's natural child.

    * Application

    * (3) Subsections (1) and (2) apply for the purposes of this Act. They also apply for the purposes of a provision of another Act if one or more of the following applies for the purposes of that provision (or would apply if it were used in the provision):

     * (a) the definition of **_child _**in subsection 9951(1);

     * (b) the definition of **_parent _**in subsection 9951(1);

     * (c) the definition of **_relative _**in subsection 9951(1);

     * (d) the definition of **_spouse _**in subsection 9951(1).

##### Subdivision 960M--Indexation

##### Guide to Subdivision 960M

##### 960260  What this Subdivision is about

    * There are a number of provisions that require amounts to be indexed. This Subdivision shows you:

     *  	how to index those amounts; and

     *  	how to calculate the indexation factor.

##### Table of sections

      * 960265	The provisions for which indexation is relevant

  * Operative provisions

      * 960270	Indexing amounts

      * 960275	_Indexation factor_

      * _960280	_Index number_

      * _960285	exation--superannuation and employment termination

##### 960265  The provisions for which indexation is relevant

    * This table sets out the provisions for which indexation is relevant.

         * Note: There are provisions of the _Income Tax Assessment Act 1936_ dealing with indexation that have not yet been rewritten.

##### Operative provisions

##### 960270  Indexing amounts

    * (1) Some provisions of this Act require amounts to be indexed. You index an amount by multiplying it by its *indexation factor.

    * (2) You do not index the amount if its *indexation factor is 1 or less.

    * (3) This section does not apply in relation to amounts mentioned in the provisions listed at items 8 to 12 in section 960265.

         * Note: For the indexation of those amounts, see section 960285.

##### 960275  Indexation factor

    * (1) For indexation of amounts on an annual basis, the **_indexation factor_** is:

    * (1A) However, for indexation of the amounts mentioned in the provisions listed at items 5, 6 and 7 in section 960265, the **_indexation factor_** is:

    * (2) For indexation of the *cost base of a *CGT asset (except the first element of the cost base of an asset covered by subsection (3)), the **_indexation factor_** for expenditure in an element of the cost base is:

    *  The expenditure can include giving property: see section 1035.

         * Note 1: This rule does not apply to expenditure incurred after  on 21 September 1999 or any expenditure relating to a CGT asset acquired after that time: see section 1141.

         * Note 2: This rule applies even if you do not actually pay some of the expenditure until a later time (for example, under a contract to purchase an asset by instalments).

         * Note 3: There are rules affecting when the expenditure was incurred: see sections 11415 and 11420.

    * (3) For indexation of the first element of the *cost base of a *CGT asset that is:

     * (a) a *share in a company; or

     * (b) a unit in a unit trust;

    * the**_ indexation factor_** for an amount in the first element of the *cost base of the asset that was paid to the company or trust at a time after it was *acquired is:

    *  The payment can include giving property: see section 1035.

         * Example: Peter acquires shares in a company. The shares are partlypaid, and the company makes a call on the shares. Peter sells the shares to Narina before he is liable to pay the call.

         * The amount Narina paid to Peter for the shares is indexed under subsection 960275(2) from the quarter in which she incurred the expenditure to acquire the shares. 

         * The amount Narina later pays for the call on the shares is indexed in accordance with subsection 960275(3) from the quarter in which she made that later payment.

         * Note 1: This subsection does not apply to shares or units you acquired before 16 August 1989: see section 960275 of the _Income Tax (Transitional Provisions) Act 1997_.

         * Note 2: This subsection does not apply to an amount paid after  on 21 September 1999 or an amount paid in relation to a CGT asset acquired after that time: see section 1141.

    * (4) However, you cannot index expenditure in the third element of the *cost base of a CGT asset (costs of ownership).

    * (5) You work out the *indexation factor to 3 decimal places (rounding up if the fourth decimal place is 5 or more).

         * Example: If the factor is 1.102795, it would be rounded up to 1.103.

    * (6) This section does not apply in relation to amounts mentioned in the provisions listed at items 8 to 12 in section 960265.

         * Note: For the indexation of those amounts, see section 960285.

##### 960280  Index number

    * (1) In most cases, the **_index number_** for a *quarter is the All Groups Consumer Price Index number (being the weighted average of the 8 capital cities) first published by the Australian Statistician for the quarter.

    * Car limit

    * (2) For calculating the *car limit, the **_index number_** for a *quarter is the index number for the motor vehicle purchase subgroup of the Consumer Price Index, being the weighted average of the 8 capital cities, first published by the Australian Statistician for the quarter.

    * (3) If the Australian Statistician changes the reference base for an *index number, only index numbers published in terms of the new base are to be used after the change.

    * Genuine redundancy, early retirement schemes, pre1 July 88 funding credits

    * (4) For calculating the amounts mentioned in the provisions listed at items 5, 6 and 7 in section 960265, the **_index number_** for a *quarter is the estimate of fulltime adult average weekly ordinary time earnings for the middle month of the quarter first published by the Australian Statistician in respect of that month.

    * (5) Subsection (3) does not apply to the index numbers mentioned in subsection (4).

    * Exception--superannuation and employment termination

    * (6) This section does not apply in relation to amounts mentioned in the provisions listed at items 8 to 12 in section 960265.

         * Note: For the indexation of those amounts, see section 960285.

##### 960285  Indexation--superannuation and employment termination

    * (1) This section applies in relation to an amount mentioned in a provision listed at items 8 to 12 in section 960265.

    * Indexing amounts

    * (2) You index the amount by:

     * (a) firstly:

       * (i) if the amount is mentioned in item 9 in section 960265 (concessional contributions cap)--multiplying the amount for the 20132014 financial year by its *indexation factor mentioned in subsection (3A); or

       * (ii) otherwise--multiplying the amount for the 20072008 income year or financial year by its indexation factor mentioned in subsection (4); and

     * (b) next, rounding the result in paragraph (a) down to the nearest multiple of $5,000.

         * Example 1: If the amount to be indexed is $140,000 and the indexation factor increases this to an indexed amount of $143,000, the indexed amount is rounded back down to $140,000.

         * Example 2: If the amount to be indexed is $140,000 and the indexation factor increases this to an indexed amount of $146,000, the indexed amount is rounded down to $145,000.

    * (3) You do not index the amount if its indexation factor mentioned in subsection (3A) or (4) is 1 or less.

    * Indexation factor

    * (3A) For indexation of the amount on an annual basis in accordance with subparagraph (2)(a)(i), the **_indexation factor_** is:

    * (4) For indexation of the amount on an annual basis in accordance with subparagraph (2)(a)(ii), the **_indexation factor_** is:

    * (5) You work out the *indexation factor mentioned in subsection (3A) or (4) to 3 decimal places (rounding up if the fourth decimal place is 5 or more).

    * Index number

    * (6) For calculating the amounts, the **_index number_** for a *quarter is the estimate of fulltime adult average weekly ordinary time earnings for the middle month of the quarter first published by the Australian Statistician in respect of that month.

##### Guide to Division 974

##### 9741  What this Division is about

    * This Division tells you whether an interest is a debt interest, or an equity interest, for tax purposes. An interest that could be characterised as both a debt interest and an equity interest will be treated as a debt interest for tax purposes (except for certain interests that fund returns on equity interests).

    * Whether an interest is a debt interest or an equity interest matters because returns on debt interests are not frankable but may be deductible while returns on equity interests are not deductible but may be frankable.

    * This Division extends beyond shares the range of interests that are recognised as equity in a company. An interest that is an equity interest in a company but is not a share will be treated in the same way as a share for some tax purposes (particularly in relation to the determination of the tax treatment of returns on the interest).

    * This Division also tells you how to work out which distributions made in respect of a nonshare equity interest in a company will be nonshare dividends and which will be nonshare capital returns. Those that are nonshare dividends will be treated, for most tax purposes, in the same way as dividends.

##### 9745  Overview of Division

    * Test for distinguishing debt and equity interests

    * (1) The test for distinguishing between debt interests and equity interests focuses on economic substance rather than mere legal form (see subsection 97410(2)). The test is designed to assess the economic substance of an interest in terms of its impact on the issuer's position.

    * Debt interests

    * (2) Subdivision 974B tells you when an interest is a debt interest in an entity. The basic test is in section 97420.

    * Equity interests

    * (3) Subdivision 974C tells you when an interest is an equity interest in a company. The basic test is in section 97475.

    * Tie breaker between debt and equity

    * (4) If an interest satisfies both the debt test and the equity test, it is treated as a debt interest and not an equity interest.

    * Distributions in relation to equity interests that are not shares

    * (5) If you have an equity interest in a company that is not a share, Subdivision 974E tells you what will count as a nonshare distribution, a nonshare dividend and a nonshare capital return in relation to the interest.

    * Concepts used in the debt and equity tests

    * (6) Subdivision 974F defines a number of concepts that are used in the debt and equity tests (financing arrangement, effectively noncontingent obligation, benchmark rate of return and converting interest).

##### Operative provisions

##### 97410  Object

    * (1) An object of this Division is to establish a test for determining for particular tax purposes whether a *scheme, or the combined operation of a number of schemes:

     * (a) gives rise to a *debt interest; or

     * (b) gives rise to an *equity interest.

         * Note: The test is used, for example, for:

          * (a) identifying distributions that may be frankable and which may be subject to dividend withholding tax; and

          * (b) identifying returns that may be deductible to the company making the return; and

          * (c) resolving uncertainty as to the proper tax treatment for debt/equity hybrid interests (interests that have some debt qualities and some equity qualities); and

          * (d) identifying debt capital for the purposes of Division 820 (thin capitalisation rules).

    * (2) Another object of this Division is that the test referred to in subsection (1) is to operate on the basis of the economic substance of the rights and obligations arising under the *scheme or schemes rather than merely on the basis of the legal form of the scheme or schemes.

         * Note 1: The basic indicator of the economic character of a debt interest is the noncontingent nature of the returns. The basic indicator of the economic character of an equity interest, on the other hand, is the contingent nature of the returns (or convertibility into an interest of that nature).

         * Note 2: The test is intended to operate, for example, to:

          * (a) deny deductibility (but allow franking) for "interest" in relation to a scheme that has the legal form of a loan if the economic substance of the rights and obligations arising under the relevant scheme gives the interest characteristics that are the same as or similar to those of a dividend on an ordinary share (and thereby prevent deductible returns on equity); and

          * (b) allow a deduction (but not franking) for a "dividend" in relation to a scheme that has the legal form of an ordinary share if the economic substance of the rights and obligations arising under the relevant scheme gives the dividend characteristics that are the same as or similar to those of deductible interest on an ordinary loan (and thereby prevent frankable returns on debt).

         * This will not happen if a provision in this Act specifically provides for a different treatment for the interest or dividend.

    * (3) Another object of this Division is that the combined effect of *related schemes be taken into account in appropriate cases:

     * (a) to ensure that the test operates effectively on the basis of the economic substance of the rights and obligations arising under the schemes rather than merely on the basis of the legal form of the schemes; and

     * (b) to prevent the test being circumvented by entities merely entering into a number of separate schemes instead of a single scheme.

    * (4) Another object of this Division is to identify the distributions and credits made in respect of *nonshare equity interests in a company that are to be treated as *dividends (**_nonshare dividends_**) and those that are to be treated as returns of capital (**_nonshare capital returns_**).

         * Note: Nonshare dividends will generally be included in the recipient's assessable income and may be frankable.

    * (5) The Commissioner must have regard to the objects stated in subsections (1) to (3) in exercising the power to make a determination under any of the following provisions:

     * (a) subsection 97415(4);

     * (b) subsection 97460(3), (4) or (5);

     * (c) section 97465;

     * (d) subsection 97470(4);

     * (e) subsection 974150(1).

         * Note: An entity can apply to the Commissioner to have a determination made and can object under Part IVC of the _Taxation Administration Act 1953 _if it is dissatisfied with a determination (see section 974112).

    * (6) Regulations may also be made under the provisions of this Division:

     * (a) to clarify the meaning of certain words and phrases in the light of emerging commercial practices, conditions and products; and

     * (b) to give guidance on the detailed operation of particular provisions.

    * The regulations must be consistent with the objects stated in subsections (1) to (3).

    * (7) Without limiting subsection 13(3) of the _Legislative Instruments Act 2003_, the regulations made for the purposes of this Division may specify different rules for different classes of circumstances.

##### 97415  Meaning of debt interest

    * Single scheme giving rise to debt interest

    * (1) A *scheme gives rise to a **_debt interest _**in an entity if the scheme, when it comes into existence, satisfies the debt test in subsection 97420(1) in relation to the entity.

         * Note 1: A debt interest can also arise under subsection (2) (related schemes) or section 97465 (Commissioner's discretion).

         * Note 2: Section 97455 defines various aspects of the debt interest that arises.

    * Related schemes giving rise to debt interest

    * (2) Two or more *related schemes (the **_constituent schemes_**) together give rise to a **_debt interest _**in an entity if:

     * (a) the entity enters into, participates in or causes another entity to enter into or participate in the constituent schemes; and

     * (b) a scheme with the combined effect or operation of the constituent schemes (the **_notional scheme_**) would satisfy the debt test in subsection 97420(1) in relation to the entity if the notional scheme came into existence when the last of the constituent schemes came into existence; and

     * (c) it is reasonable to conclude that the entity intended, or knew that a party to the scheme or one of the schemes intended, the combined economic effects of the constituent schemes to be the same as, or similar to, the economic effects of a debt interest.

    * This is so whether or not the constituent schemes come into existence at the same time and even if none of the constituent schemes would individually give rise to that or any other *debt interest.

         * Note: Section 974105 explains the effect, for tax purposes, of actions taken under the schemes.

    * (3) Subsection (2) does not apply if each of the *schemes individually gives rise to a *debt interest in the entity.

    * (4) Two or more *related schemes do not give rise to a **_debt interest_** in an entity under subsection (2) if the Commissioner determines that it would be unreasonable to apply that subsection to those schemes.

    * (5) Without limiting subsection 97410(5), the Commissioner must, in exercising the power to make a determination under subsection (4), have regard to the following:

     * (a) the purpose of the *schemes (considered both individually and in combination);

     * (b) the effects of the schemes (considered both individually and in combination);

     * (c) the rights and obligations of the parties to the schemes (considered both individually and in combination);

     * (d) whether the schemes (when considered either individually or in combination) provide the basis for, or underpin, an interest issued to investors with the expectation that the interest can be assigned to other investors;

     * (e) whether the schemes (when considered either individually or in combination) comprise a set of rights and obligations issued to investors with the expectation that it can be assigned to other investors;

     * (f) any other relevant circumstances.

    * (6) If:

     * (a) 2 or more *related schemes give rise to a *debt interest in an entity; and

     * (b) one or more of those schemes (the **_hedging scheme or schemes_**) are schemes for hedging or managing financial risk; and

     * (c) the other scheme or schemes give rise to a debt interest in the entity even if the hedging scheme or schemes are disregarded;

    * the debt interest that arises from the schemes is taken, for the purposes of Division 820 (the thin capitalisation rules), not to include the hedging scheme or schemes.

         * Note: This means that in these circumstances the losses associated with the hedging scheme or schemes are not debt deductions under section 82040.

##### 97420  The test for a debt interest

    * Satisfying the debt test

    * (1) A *scheme satisfies the debt test in this subsection in relation to an entity if:

     * (a) the scheme is a *financing arrangement for the entity; and

     * (b) the entity, or a *connected entity of the entity, receives, or will receive, a *financial benefit or benefits under the scheme; and

     * (c) the entity has, or the entity and a connected entity of the entity each has, an *effectively noncontingent obligation under the scheme to provide a financial benefit or benefits to one or more entities after the time when:

       * (i) the financial benefit referred to in paragraph (b) is received if there is only one; or

       * (ii) the first of the financial benefits referred to in paragraph (b) is received if there are more than one; and

     * (d) it is substantially more likely than not that the value provided (worked out under subsection (2)) will be at least equal to the value received (worked out under subsection (3)); and

     * (e) the value provided (worked out under subsection (2)) and the value received (worked out under subsection (3)) are not both nil.

    * The scheme does not need to satisfy paragraph (a) if the entity is a company and the interest arising from the scheme is an interest covered by item 1 of the table in subsection 97475(1) (interest as a member or stockholder of the company).

         * Note: Section 97430 tells you when a financial benefit is taken to be provided to an entity.

    * (2) The **_value provided_** is:

     * (a) the value of the *financial benefit to be provided under the *scheme by the entity or a *connected entity if there is only one; or

     * (b) the sum of the values of all the financial benefits provided or to be provided under the scheme by the entity or a connected entity of the entity if there are 2 or more.

         * Note: Section 97435 tells you how to value financial benefits.

    * (3) The **_value received_** is:

     * (a) the value of the *financial benefit received, or to be received, under the *scheme by the entity or a *connected entity of the entity if there is only one; or

     * (b) the sum of the values of all the financial benefits received, or to be received, under the scheme by the entity or a connected entity if there are 2 or more.

    * (4) For the purposes of paragraph (1)(b) and subsections (2) and (3):

     * (a) a *financial benefit to be provided under the *scheme by the entity or a *connected entity is taken into account only if it is one that the entity or connected entity has an *effectively noncontingent obligation to provide; and

     * (b) a financial benefit to be received under the scheme by the entity or a connected entity is taken into account only if it is one that another entity has an effectively noncontingent obligation to provide.

    * Multiple financial benefits

    * (5) Paragraphs (1)(b) and (c) apply to 2 or more *financial benefits whether they are provided at the same time or over a period of time.

    * Regulations

    * (6) The regulations:

     * (a) may specify circumstances in which paragraph (1)(d) is satisfied or not satisfied; and

     * (b) may otherwise specify rules to be applied in determining whether or not paragraph (1)(d) is satisfied.

##### 97425  Exceptions to the debt test

    * Short term schemes

    * (1) A *scheme does not satisfy the debt test in subsection 97420(1) in relation to an entity if:

     * (a) at least a substantial part of a *financial benefit mentioned in that subsection does not consist of either of the following or a combination of either of the following:

       * (i) a liquid or monetary asset;

       * (ii) an amount of money; and

     * (b) the scheme requires the financial benefit mentioned in paragraph 97420(1)(c) to be provided within a period of no more than 100 days of the receipt of the first financial benefit mentioned in paragraph 97420(1)(b); and

     * (c) the financial benefit mentioned in paragraph 97420(1)(c):

       * (i) is in fact provided within that period; or

       * (ii) is not provided within that period because the entity required to provide the benefit neglects to provide the benefit within that period (although willing to do so); or

       * (iii) is not provided within that period because the entity required to provide the benefit is unable to provide the benefit within that period (although willing to do so); and

     * (d) the scheme is not one of a number of *related schemes that together are taken to give rise to a *debt interest under subsection 97415(2).

    * Regulations

    * (2) The regulations may make provision in relation to the application or operation of subsection (1). Without limiting this, the regulations may:

     * (a) specify what constitutes a substantial part of a *financial benefit for the purposes of paragraph (1)(a); or

     * (b) specify a period to be substituted for the period referred to in paragraph (1)(b).

##### 97430  Providing a financial benefit

    * Issue of equity interest

    * (1) The following do not constitute the provision of a *financial benefit by an entity or a *connected entity of the entity:

     * (a) the issue of an *equity interest in the entity or a connected entity of the entity; or

     * (b) an amount that is to be applied in respect of the issue of an equity interest in the entity or a connected entity of the entity.

    * Providing a financial benefit to an entity

    * (2) A *financial benefit is taken to be provided to an entity if it is provided:

     * (a) to the entity; or

     * (b) on the entity's behalf; or

     * (c) for the entity's benefit.

    * Obligation to provide future financial benefit

    * (3) For the avoidance of doubt, if you have a present obligation to provide a *financial benefit to an entity at some time in the future:

     * (a) the financial benefit is taken to be a financial benefit to be provided in the future; and

     * (b) the obligation to provide the financial benefit is taken not to be a financial benefit being provided at the present.

##### 97435  Valuation of financial benefits--general rules

    * Value in nominal terms or present value terms

    * (1) For the purposes of this Subdivision:

     * (a) the value of a *financial benefit received or provided under a *scheme is its value calculated:

       * (i) in nominal terms if the performance period (see subsection (3)) must end no later than 10 years after the interest arising from the scheme is issued; or

       * (ii) in present value terms (see section 97450) if the performance period must or may end more than 10 years after the interest arising from the scheme is issued; and

     * (b) the regulations may make provisions relating to the valuation of a financial benefit.

    * Assume scheme runs its full term

    * (2) The value of a *financial benefit received or provided under a *scheme is calculated assuming that the interest arising from the scheme will continue to be held for the rest of its life.

         * Note 1: Section 97440 makes specific provision for cases in which there is a right or option to terminate the interest early.

         * Note 2: Section 97445 makes specific provision for cases involving convertible interests.

    * Performance period

    * (3) The **_performance period_** is the period within which, under the terms on which the interest is issued, the *effectively noncontingent obligations of the issuer, and any *connected entity of the issuer, to provide a *financial benefit in relation to the interest have to be met.

    * (4) An obligation is treated as having to be met within 10 years after the interest is issued if:

     * (a) the issuer; or

     * (b) the *connected entity of the issuer;

    * has an *effectively noncontingent obligation to terminate the interest within that 10 year period even if the terms on which the interest is issued formally allow the obligation to continue after the end of that 10 year period.

    * Benefit dependent on variable factor

    * (5) If:

     * (a) a *financial benefit received or provided in respect of an interest depends on a factor that may vary over time (such as a variable interest rate); and

     * (b) that factor is one commonly used in commercial arrangements; and

     * (c) it would be unreasonable to expect any of the parties to the *scheme to know, or to anticipate accurately, the future value of that factor; and

     * (d) that factor has a particular value (the **_starting value_**) when the scheme is entered into;

    * the value of the financial benefit is calculated assuming that the factor's value will retain the starting value for the whole of the life of the scheme.

         * Note: For example, the value of a return based on a floating interest rate is calculated on the basis that the interest rate remains the interest rate that is applicable when the scheme is entered into.

    * Scheme wholly in foreign currency etc.

    * (6) If all the *financial benefits provided and received under a *scheme are denominated in a particular foreign currency or in terms of quantities of a particular commodity or other unit of account, they are not to be converted into Australian currency for the purpose of comparing their relative values for the purposes of this Subdivision.

##### 97440  Valuation of financial benefits--rights and options to terminate early

    * (1) This section deals with the situation in which a party to a *scheme has a right or option to terminate the scheme early (whether by discharging an obligation early, converting the interest arising from the scheme into another interest or otherwise).

         * Note 1: An example of terminating a scheme early by discharging an obligation early is terminating a loan by discharging the obligation to repay the principal (and any outstanding interest) early.

         * Note 2: In certain circumstances, conversion of an interest into another interest can terminate its life (see section 97445).

    * (2) The existence of the right or option is to be disregarded in working out the length of the life of the interest arising from the *scheme for the purposes of this Subdivision if the party does not have an *effectively noncontingent obligation to exercise the right or option.

    * (3) If the party does have an *effectively noncontingent obligation to exercise the right or option, the life of the interest ends at the earliest time at which the party will have to exercise the right or option.

    * (4) This section does not limit subsection 97435(2).

##### 97445  Valuation of financial benefits--convertible interests

    * (1) This section deals with the situation in which a *scheme gives rise to an *interest that will or may convert into an *equity interest in a company.

    * (2) The life of the interest ends no later than the time when it converts into that *equity interest.

    * (3) The possibility of the conversion is to be disregarded in working out the length of the life of the interest arising from the *scheme for the purposes of section 97435 if it is uncertain:

     * (a) whether the interest will ever convert; or

     * (b) when the interest will convert.

         * Note: Section 97440 deals with the situation in which a party to the scheme may exercise a right or option to convert the interest.

    * (4) This section does not limit subsection 97435(2).

##### 97450  Valuation of financial benefits--value in present value terms

    * (1) Subject to the regulations made for the purposes of subsection (5), the value in present value terms of a *financial benefit to be provided or received in respect of an interest (the **_test interest_**) is calculated under subsection (4).

    * (2) If you need to calculate the values in present value terms of a number of *financial benefits, the value of each financial benefit is to be calculated separately.

    * (3) The value of a *financial benefit is to be calculated assuming that all amounts to be paid by an entity in respect of the test interest are paid at the earliest time when the entity becomes liable to pay them.

    * (4) The value of a *financial benefit in present value terms is:

    * where: 

    * **_adjusted benchmark rate of return_** is 75% of the *benchmark rate of return on the test interest.

    * **_n_** is the number of years in the period starting on the day on which the test interest is issued and ending on the day on which the *financial benefit is to be provided. If the period includes a part of a year, that part is to be expressed as the fraction:

    * **_year_** means a period of 12 months.

    * (5) The regulations may provide for the method of calculating the value in present value terms of a *financial benefit.

    * (6) Without limiting subsection (5), the regulations may:

     * (a) provide for an entirely different method of calculating the present value of the *financial benefit; or

     * (b) specify the adjusted *benchmark rate of return; or

     * (c) provide for a different method of determining the adjusted benchmark rate of return; or

     * (d) specify rules for determining whether a *debt interest is an *ordinary debt interest.

##### 97455  The debt interest and its issue

    * (1) If a *scheme, or 2 or more *related schemes, give rise to a *debt interest in an entity, the debt interest:

     * (a) consists of the interest that carries the right to receive a *financial benefit that the entity or a *connected entity has an *effectively noncontingent obligation to provide under the scheme or any of the schemes; and

     * (b) is taken, subject to section 97460, to be a debt interest in the entity; and

     * (c) is taken to be issued by the entity; and

     * (d) is **_issued_** when the entity (or a connected entity of the entity) first receives a *financial benefit under the scheme or any of the schemes; and

     * (e) is **_on issue_** while an effectively noncontingent obligation of the entity (or a connected entity of the entity) to provide a financial benefit under the scheme or any of the schemes remains unfulfilled.

    * (2) The interest referred to in paragraph (1)(a) may take the form of a proprietary right, a chose in action or any other form.

##### 97460  Debt interest arising out of obligations owed by a number of entities

    * (1) This section deals with the situation in which a *scheme, or a number of *related schemes together, would, apart from this section, give rise to the same *debt interest in 2 or more entities.

         * Note: A scheme may give rise to the same debt interest in 2 or more entities if each of those entities has noncontingent obligations to provide financial benefits under the scheme.

    * (2) The *debt interest:

     * (a) is a debt interest in the entity identified under subsection (3) or (4); and

     * (b) is not a debt interest in the other entity or entities.

    * (3) The *debt interest is a debt interest in the entity identified using the following method statement:

Method statement

       * Step 1.	Work out, for each of the entities, the total value of the *financial benefits that the entity is under an *effectively noncontingent obligation to provide under the *scheme or schemes: this is the entity's **_obligation value_**.

       * Step 2.	The *debt interest is taken to be a debt interest in the entity with the greatest obligation value.

       * Step 3.	If it is not possible to determine which entity has the greatest obligation value (whether because of an equality of, or uncertainty as to, obligation values or otherwise), the *debt interest is taken to be a debt interest in the entity agreed on by all the entities.

       * Step 4.	If the entities do not agree, the interest is taken to be a *debt interest in the entity determined by the Commissioner.

    * (4) Despite subsection (3), the Commissioner may determine that the *debt interest is a debt interest in the entity specified in the determination.

    * (5) The Commissioner may make the determination only if satisfied, having regard to the economic substance of the relevant transactions, that the *debt interest is properly considered from a commercial point of view to be an interest in the entity specified in the determination.

##### 97465  Commissioner's power

    * (1) Despite subsection 97420(1) (the debt test), the Commissioner may determine that a *scheme gives rise to a **_debt interest_** in an entity if the Commissioner considers that:

     * (a) the scheme would satisfy paragraphs 97420(1)(a), (b), (c) and (e); but

     * (b) instead of satisfying paragraph 97420(1)(d), the scheme would satisfy all the following subparagraphs:

       * (i) it is substantially more likely than not that the value of the *financial benefit to be provided by the entity (or a *connected entity of the entity) under the *effectively noncontingent obligation will be at least equal to the substantial part of the value of the financial benefit received or to be received by the entity (or its connected entity) under the scheme;

       * (ii) it is substantially more likely than not that other financial benefits will be provided by the entity (or its connected entity) to one or more entities under the scheme;

       * (iii) it is substantially more likely than not that the sum of the values of the financial benefits mentioned in subparagraphs (i) and (ii) will be at least equal to the value of the financial benefit received by the entity (or its connected entity) under the scheme.

    * (2) In making the determination, the Commissioner must have regard to the following:

     * (a) the difference between the value of the *financial benefit received and the value of the financial benefit to be provided under the *effectively noncontingent obligation;

     * (b) the degree of likelihood of other financial benefits being provided under the *scheme;

     * (c) the degree of likelihood of the sum of the value of the financial benefits mentioned in subparagraphs (1)(b)(i) and (ii) being equal to or greater than the value of the financial benefit received under the scheme;

     * (d) the particular circumstances surrounding the scheme (including circumstances of the parties to the scheme and their purposes for entering into the scheme).

    * (3) If the Commissioner determines under this section that a *scheme gives rise to a *debt interest, the scheme has that effect for all purposes of this Division.

##### 97470  Meaning of equity interest in a company

    * Scheme giving rise to equity interest

    * (1) A *scheme gives rise to an **_equity interest _**in a company if, when the scheme comes into existence:

     * (a) the scheme satisfies the equity test in subsection 97475(1) in relation to the company because of the existence of an interest; and

     * (b) the interest is not characterised as, and does not form part of a larger interest that is characterised as, a *debt interest in the company, or a *connected entity of the company, under Subdivision 974B.

         * Note 1: An equity interest can also arise under subsection (2) if a notional scheme with the combined effect of a number of related schemes would give rise to an equity interest under this subsection. To do this, the notional scheme would need to satisfy paragraph (b). This means that the related schemes will not give rise to an equity interest if the notional scheme would be characterised as (or form part of a larger interest that would be characterised as) a debt interest in the company or a connected entity.

         * Note 2: An equity interest can also arise under section 97480 (arrangements for funding return through connected entities).

         * Note 3: Section 97495 defines various aspects of the equity interest that arises.

    * Related schemes giving rise to equity interest

    * (2) Two or more *related schemes (the **_constituent schemes_**) are taken together to give rise to an **_equity interest_** in a company if:

     * (a) the company enters into, participates in or causes another entity to enter into or participate in the constituent schemes; and

     * (b) a scheme with the combined effect or operation of the constituent schemes (the **_notional scheme_**) would give rise to an *equity interest in the company under subsection (1) if the notional scheme came into existence when the last of the constituent schemes came into existence; and

     * (c) it is reasonable to conclude that the company intended, or knew that a party to the scheme or one of the schemes intended, the combined economic effects of the constituent schemes to be the same as, or similar to, the economic effects of an equity interest.

    * This is so whether or not the constituent schemes come into existence at the same time and even if none of the constituent schemes would individually give rise to that or any other equity interest.

         * Note: Section 974105 explains the effect, for tax purposes, of actions taken under the schemes.

    * (3) Subsection (2) does not apply if each of the constituent *schemes individually gives rise to an *equity interest in the company.

    * (4) Two or more related *schemes do not give rise to an *equity interest in a company under subsection (2) if the Commissioner determines that it would be unreasonable to apply that subsection to those schemes.

    * (5) Without limiting subsection 97410(5), the Commissioner must, in exercising the power to make a determination under subsection (4), have regard to the following:

     * (a) the purpose of the *schemes (considered both individually and in combination);

     * (b) the effects of the schemes (considered both individually and in combination);

     * (c) the rights and obligations of the parties to the schemes (considered both individually and in combination);

     * (d) whether the schemes (when considered either individually or in combination) provide the basis for, or underpin, an interest issued to investors with the expectation that the interest can be assigned to other investors;

     * (e) whether the schemes (when considered either individually or in combination) comprise a set of rights and obligations issued to investors with the expectation that it can be assigned to other investors;

     * (f) any other relevant circumstances.

##### 97475  The test for an equity interest

    * Basic test for equity interest

    * (1) A *scheme satisfies the equity test in this subsection in relation to a company if it gives rise to an interest set out in the following table:

    * This subsection has effect subject to subsection (2) (requirement for financing arrangement).

         * Note: Section 97490 allows regulations to be made clarifying when a right or return is taken to be at discretion of a company or connected entity.

    * Financing arrangement

    * (2) A *scheme that would otherwise give rise to an *equity interest in a company because of an item in the table in subsection (1) (other than item 1) does not give rise to an equity interest in the company unless the scheme is a *financing arrangement for the company.

    * Form interest may take

    * (3) The interest referred to in item 2, 3 or 4 in the table in subsection (1) may take the form of a proprietary right, a chose in action or any other form.

    * Exception for certain at call loans--until 30 June 2005

    * (4) If:

     * (a) a *financing arrangement takes the form of a loan to a company by a *connected entity; and

     * (b) the loan does not have a fixed term; and

     * (c) either:

       * (i) the loan is repayable on demand made by the connected entity, and repayment is required immediately on the making of the demand, or is required at the end of a particular period after the demand is made (being a period that is not longer than is reasonably necessary to arrange repayment); or

       * (ii) the loan is repayable on the death of the connected entity (if the connected entity is an individual); and

     * (d) the arrangement was entered into on or before 30 June 2005;

    * the arrangement does not give rise to an **_equity interest_** in the company. Instead, the arrangement is taken, despite anything in Subdivision 974B, to give rise to a **_debt interest_** in the company. This subsection ceases to have effect on 1 July 2005.

         * Note: If this subsection ceases to have effect in relation to an interest that is, according to the other provisions of this Division, an equity interest immediately after the cessation, an adjustment to the company's nonshare capital account will occur at that time (see subsection 16415(2)).

    * (5) If, while subsection (4) applies to a *financing arrangement, a circumstance occurs that would otherwise have attracted the operation of subsection 974110(1) or (2) in relation to the arrangement:

     * (a) that subsection of section 974110 does not apply to change the result that subsection (4) of this section produces in relation to the arrangement; but

     * (b) for the purpose of applying this Division in relation to the arrangement after subsection (4) of this section has ceased to have effect, that subsection of section 974110 is taken to have produced the result that it would have produced if subsection (4) of this section had not applied to the arrangement.

    * Further exception for certain related party at call loans

    * (6) In applying this Division in relation to a particular *scheme and a particular income year (which may be the income year in which the scheme is entered into or a later income year), the scheme is taken not to give rise to an **_equity interest _**in a company, and instead to give rise to a **_debt interest _**in the company, if:

     * (a) the scheme takes the form of a loan to the company that satisfies paragraphs (4)(a), (b) and (c); and

     * (b) the company's *GST turnover (worked out at the end of the income year) is less than $20,000,000.

         * Note: If this subsection does not apply in relation to the previous income year or the next income year, and the scheme gives rise to an equity interest according to the other provisions of this Division, an adjustment to the company's nonshare capital account will occur at the end of the previous income year or the start of the next income year (see subsections 16415(2) and 16420(3)).

    * (7) For the purpose of paragraph (6)(b), the question whether a company's *GST turnover (worked out at the end of an income year) is less than $20,000,000 is to be determined in accordance with subsection 18810(2) of the *GST Act, as if that amount of $20,000,000 were a turnover threshold for the purposes of that subsection of the GST Act.

##### 97480  Equity interest arising from arrangement funding return through connected entities

    * (1) This section deals with the situation in which:

     * (a) an interest carries a right to a variable or fixed return from a company; and

     * (b) the interest is held by a *connected entity of the company; and

     * (c) apart from this section, the interest would not be an *equity interest in the company; and

     * (ca) the *scheme that gives rise to the interest is a *financing arrangement for the company; and

     * (d) there is a scheme, or a series of schemes, designed to operate so that the return to the connected entity is to be used to fund (directly or indirectly) a return to another person (the **_ultimate recipient_**).

    * (2) The interest is an **_equity interest_** in the company if:

     * (a) the amount of the return to the ultimate recipient is in substance or effect *contingent on the economic performance (whether past, current or future) of:

       * (i) the company; or

       * (ii) a part of the company's activities; or

       * (iii) a *connected entity of the company or a part of the activities of a connected entity of the company; or

     * (b) either the right itself, or the amount of the return to the ultimate recipient, is at the discretion of:

       * (i) the company; or

       * (ii) a connected entity of the company; or

     * (c) the interest in respect of which the return to the ultimate recipient is made or another interest that arises from the scheme, or any of the schemes, referred to in paragraph (1)(d):

       * (i) gives the ultimate recipient (or a connected entity of the ultimate recipient) a right to be issued with an *equity interest in the company or a connected entity of the company; or

       * (ii) is an *interest that will, or may, convert into an equity interest in the company or a connected entity of the company;

    * and if the interest does not form part of a larger interest that is characterised as a *debt interest in the entity in which it is held, or a *connected entity, under Subdivision 974B. The return may be a return of an amount invested in the interest.

         * Note 1: Section 97490 allows regulations to be made clarifying when a right or return is taken to be at the discretion of a company or connected entity.

         * Note 2: Paragraphs (a), (b) and (c) parallel items 2, 3 and 4 of the table in subsection 97475(1).

         * Example: Company A, Company B1, Company B2 and Company B3 are connected entities.

         * Company B1 operates Trust Fund C. An interest in Trust Fund C is issued to person H and the return on that interest is contingent on the economic performance of Company A.

         * Trust Fund C lends the money paid by H for the purchase of the interest to Company B1 which lends the money to Company B2 which lends the money to Company B3 which lends the money to Company A.

         * Under the arrangements under which the interest is issued and the loans made, payments of interest by Company A on the loan that Company B3 makes to Company A are intended to pass back through Company B2 and Company B1 to fund the return on H's interest in Trust Fund C.

         * Under subsection (2), Company B3 will have an equity interest in Company A. If the return to Company B3 were itself contingent on Company A's performance, Company B3's interest would be an equity interest in Company A under item 2 of the table in subsection 97475(1) (and not under subsection (2) of this section).

         * Company B2 has an equity interest in Company B3 and Company B1 has an equity interest in Company B2. This is because the returns they get are intended to fund the return on H's interest in Trust Fund C and that return is contingent on the economic performance of Company A (which is related to both Company B3 and Company B2).

    * (3) The interest referred to in paragraph (1)(a) or (2)(c) may take the form of a proprietary right, a chose in action or any other form.

##### 97485  Right or return contingent on economic performance

    * (1) A right, or the amount of a return, is not **_contingent on the economic performance_** of an entity, or a part of the entity's activities, merely because the right or return is contingent on:

     * (a) the ability or willingness of an entity to meet the obligation to satisfy the right to the return; or

     * (b) the receipts or turnover of the entity or the turnover generated by those activities.

    * (2) The regulations may specify circumstances in which a right or return is to be taken to be contingent, or not contingent, on the economic performance of an entity or a part of an entity's activities.

    * (3) The regulations may provide that paragraph (1)(b) does not apply in the circumstances specified in the regulations.

    * (4) The regulations may provide that an interest that:

     * (a) is covered by item 2 in the table in subsection 97475(1) or paragraph 97480(2)(a); and

     * (b) arises in the circumstances specified in the regulations;

    * is not an **_equity interest_** because of:

     * (c) the limited extent to which the right or return that the interest carries is *contingent on the economic performance of an entity or a part of the entity's activities; or

     * (d) the practical insignificance of the right or return that the interest carries being contingent on that performance.

##### 97490  Right or return at discretion of company or connected entity

    * The regulations may specify circumstances in which a right, or the amount of a return, is to be taken to be **_at the discretion_** of a company or a *connected entity of the company.

##### 97495  The equity interest

    * (1) If a *scheme gives rise to an *equity interest in a company because of an item of the table in subsection 97475(1), the equity interest consists of the interest referred to in that item.

    * (2) If 2 or more *related schemes give rise to an *equity interest in a company because of an item of the table in subsection 97475(1), the equity interest consists of the combination of interests under the schemes that satisfy the requirements of that item.

    * (3) Subsection 97480(2) also provides that certain interests are *equity interests in a company.

    * (4) If the returns on a *nonshare equity interest in a company are payable to 2 or more entities:

     * (a) each entity is taken to be the holder of a nonshare equity interest in the company; and

     * (b) each entity's nonshare equity interest consists of the interests that:

       * (i) constitute the nonshare equity interest; and

       * (ii) are held by that entity.

    * (5) The company in which an *equity interest exists is taken to be the issuer of the interest.

      * 974105	Effect of action taken in relation to interest arising from related schemes

      * 974110	Effect of material change

      * 974112	Determinations by Commissioner

##### 974100  Treatment of convertible and converting interests

    * (1) If a *debt interest is an *interest that will or may convert into an *equity interest, the conversion is taken, for the purposes of this Division to give rise to a new interest (and is not treated merely as a continuation of the debt interest).

    * (2) If an *equity interest is an *interest that will or may convert into a *debt interest, the conversion is taken, for the purposes of this Division to give rise to a new interest (and is not treated merely as a continuation of the equity interest).

##### 974105  Effect of action taken in relation to interest arising from related schemes

    * (1) If:

     * (a) a *scheme, or schemes, give rise to a *debt interest in an entity or an *equity interest in a company; and

     * (b) the entity or company pays a return, or undertakes any other transaction, in respect of any of the following (the **_component element_**):

       * (i) the scheme; or

       * (ii) a part of the scheme; or

       * (iii) one of those schemes; or

       * (iv) a part of one of those schemes;

    * then, for the purposes of the provisions that subsection (2) covers, the return is taken to be paid, or the transaction to have been undertaken, in respect of the debt interest or equity interest and not in respect of the component element.

         * Example: Company A issues a convertible note to Company B. Company C, a connected entity of Company B, provides a binding collateral undertaking to Company A that Company B will exercise the option to convert the note into shares in Company A. The convertible note and the undertaking are related schemes that may give rise to an equity interest in Company A if their combined effect satisfies section 97470. If so, the returns on the note are taken to be returns in respect of the equity interest.

    * (2) This subsection covers:

     * (a) the provisions of this Division (other than this section); and

     * (b) any other provision of this Act whose operation depends on an expression whose meaning is given by this Division.

##### 974110  Effect of material change

    * Change to existing scheme--general rule

    * (1) If:

     * (a) a *scheme or schemes give rise to a *debt interest (or an *equity interest) in a company; and

     * (b) the scheme, or one or more of the schemes, are subsequently changed, including where one or more (but not all) of the schemes cease to exist; and

     * (c) the scheme or schemes as they exist immediately after the change would give rise to an equity interest (or a debt interest) in the company if they came into existence when the change occurred; and

     * (d) subsection (1A) does not apply to the change;

    * this Division applies after the change as if the scheme or schemes as they exist immediately after the change came into existence when the change occurred.

         * Note 1: This will mean that the characterisation of the interest will change at that time.

         * Note 2: This section can apply to an interest a number of times so that, for example, an interest that is equity when issued may change to debt because of one subsequent change and then back to equity because of a later change.

         * Note 3: There will be an adjustment to the company's nonshare capital account when the change occurs (see subsections 16415(2) and 16420(3)).

    * Change to existing scheme--special rule for changing a related party at call etc. loan to a private company from equity to debt

    * (1A) If:

     * (a) a *scheme takes the form of a loan that satisfies paragraphs 97475(4)(a), (b) and (c); and

     * (b) the scheme gives rise to an *equity interest (disregarding the effect this subsection has on the characterisation of the interest because of the change referred to in paragraph (c) of this subsection); and

     * (c) the scheme is subsequently changed; and

     * (d) the change occurs in the period starting immediately after the end of a particular income year (the **_year of effect_**) and ending at the end of the earlier of the following days:

       * (i) the due date for lodgment of the company's *income tax return for the year of effect;

       * (ii) the date of lodgment of the company's income tax return for the year of effect; and

     * (e) the scheme, as it exists immediately after the change, would give rise to a *debt interest in the company if the interest came into existence when the change occurred; and

     * (f) the company is a *private company in relation to the year of effect; and

     * (g) subsection 97475(6) does not apply in relation to the loan and the year of effect; and

     * (h) the company elects that this subsection is to apply to the change;

    * this Division applies as if the scheme, as it exists immediately after the change, had come into existence at the start of the year of effect, and as if no other change of a kind referred to in subsection (1) had occurred in relation to the interest in the period commencing at the start of the year of effect and ending when the firstmentioned change was made.

         * Note 1: This will mean that:

          * (a) the characterisation of the interest will change, with effect back to the start of the year of effect; and

          * (b) that characterisation will not be affected by other changes that occurred after the start of the year of effect and before the change to which this subsection applies.

         * Note 2: This section can apply to an interest a number of times so that, for example, an interest that is an equity interest when issued may change to debt because of one subsequent change and then back to equity because of a later change.

         * Note 3: An adjustment to the company's nonshare capital account will be taken to have occurred at the start of the year of effect (see subsection 16420(3)).

    * (1B) An election for the purposes of paragraph (1A)(h):

     * (a) must be in writing; and

     * (b) can only be made in the period referred to in paragraph (1A)(d); and

     * (c) cannot be revoked.

    * Entering into a new related scheme

    * (2) If:

     * (a) a *scheme or schemes give rise to a *debt interest (or an *equity interest) in a company; and

     * (b) the company subsequently enters into, participates in or causes another entity to enter into or participate in a new *related scheme; and

     * (c) the scheme or schemes, together with:

       * (i) the new related scheme; and

       * (ii) any other related scheme that the entity (or company) enters into, participates in or causes another entity to enter into or participate in before the new related scheme is entered into;

     * would give rise to an equity interest (or a debt interest) in the company if they all came into existence when the new related scheme is entered into;

    * this Division applies after the new related scheme is entered into as if all the schemes referred to in paragraph (c) had come into existence when the new related scheme is entered into.

         * Note 1: This will mean that the characterisation of the interest will change at that time.

         * Note 2: This section can apply to an interest a number of times so that, for example, an interest that is equity when issued may change to debt because of one subsequent change and then back to equity because of a later change.

         * Note 3: There will be an adjustment to the company's nonshare capital account when the change occurs (see subsections 16415(2) and 16420(3)).

    * All prior changes to be taken into account

    * (3) In applying paragraphs (1)(c), (1A)(e) and (2)(c) to the *scheme or schemes, take into account:

     * (a) all changes to the scheme or schemes that occur before the change or before the new related scheme is entered into; and

     * (b) all *related schemes entered into before the change or before the new related scheme is entered into; and

     * (c) all changes to related schemes referred to in paragraph (b) that occur before the change or before the new related scheme is entered into.

    * (1) A *scheme is a **_financing arrangement_** for an entity if it is entered into or undertaken:

     * (a) to raise finance for the entity (or a *connected entity of the entity); or

     * (b) to fund another scheme, or a part of another scheme, that is a *financing arrangement under paragraph (a); or

     * (a) a bill of exchange;

     * (b) income securities;

     * (c) a *convertible interest that will convert into an *equity interest.

       * (ii) the lease or bailment is not a relevant agreement for the purposes of section 128AC of that Act (deemed interest in respect of hirepurchase and certain other arrangements);

       * (iii) the lease or bailment is not an *arrangement to which Division 240 of this Act (about arrangements treated as a sale and loan), or Division 242 of this Act (about luxury car leases), applies;

       * (v) the lessee or bailee, or a *connected entity of the lessee or bailee, is not to, and does not have an obligation (whether contingent or not) or a right to, acquire the leased or bailed property;

       * (vi) Division 250 of this Act does not apply to a person and the property leased or bailed;

     * (b) a securities lending arrangement under section 26BC of the _Income Tax Assessment Act 1936_;

     * (c) a life insurance or general insurance contract undertaken as part of the issuer's ordinary course of business;

     * (d) a scheme for the payment of royalties (within the meaning of the _Income Tax Assessment Act 1936_) other than:

       * (i) a qualifying arrangement for the purposes of Division 16D of Part III of the _Income Tax Assessment Act 1936_; or

       * (ii) a relevant agreement for the purposes of section 128AC of that Act; or

       * (iii) a scheme or arrangement for the payment of royalties in relation to an asset if Division 250 of this Act applies to a person and the asset.

    * (5) The regulations may:

     * (a) specify that particular *schemes are not **_financing arrangements_**; and

     * (b) specify circumstances in which a scheme will not be a **_financing arrangement_**.

##### 974135  Effectively noncontingent obligation

    * (1) There is an **_effectively noncontingent obligation_** to take an action under a *scheme if, having regard to the pricing, terms and conditions of the scheme, there is in substance or effect a noncontingent obligation (see subsections (3), (4) and (6)) to take that action.

    * (2) Without limiting subsection (1), that subsection applies to:

     * (a) providing a *financial benefit under the *scheme; or

     * (b) terminating the scheme.

    * (3) An obligation is **_noncontingent_** if it is not contingent on any event, condition or situation (including the economic performance of the entity having the obligation or a *connected entity of that entity), other than the ability or willingness of that entity or connected entity to meet the obligation.

    * (4) The existence of the right of the holder of an *interest that will or may convert into an *equity interest in a company to convert the interest does not of itself make the issuer's obligation to repay the investment not noncontingent.

    * (5) An obligation to redeem a preference share is not contingent merely because there is a legislative requirement for the redemption amount to be met out of profits or a fresh issue of *equity interests.

    * (6) In determining whether there is in substance or effect a noncontingent obligation to take the action, have regard to the artificiality, or the contrived nature, of any contingency on which the obligation to take the action depends.

         * Note: The artificiality, or the contrived nature, of a contingency would tend to indicate that there is, in substance or effect, a noncontingent obligation to take that action.

    * (7) An obligation of yours is not **_effectively noncontingent_** merely because you will suffer some detrimental practical or commercial consequences if you do not fulfil the obligation.

         * Note: For example, a contingent obligation to make payments in respect of an income security issued by an approved deposittaking institution (ADI) is not effectively noncontingent merely because of the detrimental effect nonpayment would have on the ADI's business.

    * (8) The regulations may make further provisions relating to the following:

     * (a) what constitutes a noncontingent obligation;

     * (b) what does not constitute a noncontingent obligation;

     * (c) what constitutes an *effectively noncontingent obligation;

     * (d) what does not constitute an effectively noncontingent obligation.

##### 974140  Ordinary debt interest

    * (1) A *debt interest arising from a scheme is an **_ordinary debt interest_** if none of the obligations under the scheme is in substance or effect *contingent on the economic performance of:

     * (a) the issuer of the interest; or

     * (b) a *connected entity; or

     * (c) a part of the operations of the issuer or a connected entity.

    * (2) The regulations may specify rules for determining whether a *debt interest is an *ordinary debt interest.

##### 974145  Benchmark rate of return

    * (1) The **_benchmark rate of return _**for an interest (the **_test interest)_** in an entity is the annually compounded internal rate of return on an *ordinary debt interest that:

     * (a) is issued, immediately before the test interest is issued, by the entity, or an equivalent entity, to an entity that is not a *connected entity; and

     * (b) has a comparable maturity date; and

     * (c) is in the same currency; and

     * (d) is issued in the same market; and

     * (e) has the same credit status; and

     * (f) has the same degree of subordination to debts owed to the ordinary creditors of the issuer.

    * (2) If there is no interest that satisfies subsection (1), the **_benchmark rate of return_** for the test interest is the annually compounded internal rate of return on an interest that is closest to the test interest in the respects referred to in that subsection (adjusted appropriately to take account of the differences between that interest and the test interest).

    * (3) The regulations may:

     * (a) specify the meaning to be given to an expression used in this section; or

     * (b) provide for a different method of determining the *benchmark rate of return.

##### 974150  Schemes

    * (1) The Commissioner:

     * (a) may determine that what would otherwise be a single *scheme is to be treated for the purposes of this Division as 2 or more separate schemes; and

     * (b) may determine that the schemes are to be taken for the purposes of this Division to not be *related schemes.

    * (2) Without limiting subsection 97410(5), the Commissioner must, in exercising the power to make a determination under subsection (1), have regard to the following:

     * (a) the purpose of the *scheme (considered both as a whole and in terms of its individual components);

     * (b) the effects of the scheme and each of its components (considered both as a whole and in terms of its individual components);

     * (c) the rights and obligations of the parties to the scheme (considered both as a whole and in relation to its individual components);

     * (d) whether the scheme (when considered as a whole or in terms of its individual components) provides the basis for, or underpins, an interest issued to investors with the expectation that the interest can be assigned to other investors;

     * (e) whether the scheme (when considered as a whole or in terms of its individual components) comprises a set of rights and obligations issued to investors with the expectation that it can be assigned to other investors;

     * (f) any other relevant circumstances.

    * (3) The regulations:

     * (a) may provide that, in the circumstances specified in the regulations, what would otherwise be a single *scheme is to be treated for the purposes of this Division as 2 or more separate schemes; and

     * (b) may provide that the schemes are to be taken for the purposes of this Division to not be *related schemes.

##### 974155  Related schemes

    * (1) Subject to subsection (3), 2 *schemes are **_related_** to one another if they are related to one another in any way.

    * (2) Without limiting subsection (1), 2 *schemes are **_related_** to each other if:

     * (a) the schemes are based on stapled instruments; or

     * (b) one of the schemes would, from a commercial point of view, be unlikely to be entered into unless the other scheme was entered into; or

     * (c) one of the schemes depends for its effect on the operation of the other scheme; or

     * (d) one scheme complements or supplements the other; or

     * (e) there is another scheme to which both the schemes are related because of a previous application or applications of this subsection.

    * (3) Two *schemes are not **_related_** to one another merely because:

     * (a) one refers to the other; or

     * (b) they have a common party.

    * (4) The regulations may specify circumstances in which 2 *schemes:

     * (a) are taken to be related to one another; or

     * (b) are taken not to be related to one another.

##### 974160  Financial benefit

    * (1) In this Act:

    * **_financial benefit_**:

     * (a) means anything of economic value; and

     * (b) includes property and services; and

     * (c) includes anything that regulations made for the purposes of subsection (3) provide is a financial benefit;

    * even if the transaction that confers the benefit on an entity also imposes an obligation on the entity.

    * (2) In applying subsection (1), benefits and obligations are to be looked at separately and not set off against each other.

    * (3) The regulations may provide that a thing specified in the regulations is a **_financial benefit_** for the purposes of this Act.

##### 974165  Convertible and converting interests

    * An interest (the **_first interest_**) is an **_interest that will or may convert into another interest_** (the **_second interest_**) if:

     * (a) the first interest, or a part of the first interest, must be or may be converted into the second interest; or

     * (b) the first interest, or a part of the first interest, must be or may be redeemed, repaid or satisfied by:

       * (i) the issue or transfer of the second interest (whether to the holder of the first interest or to some other person); or

       * (ii) the acquisition of the second interest (whether by the holder of the first interest or by some other person); or

       * (iii) the application in or towards payingup (in whole or in part) the balance unpaid on the second interest (whether the second interest is to be issued to the holder of the first interest or to some other person); or

     * (c) the holder of the first interest has, or is to have, a right or option to have allotted or transferred to the holder or to some other person, or for the holder or some other person otherwise to acquire:

       * (i) the second interest; or

       * (ii) a right or option to acquire the second interest.

      * 975160	When an entity has an _associateinclusive control interest_

##### _975150  Position to affect rights in relation to a company

    * (1) A person is **_in a position to affect rights_** of a company in relation to another company if the person has a right, power or option:

     * (a) to acquire those rights from one or other of those companies; or

     * (b) to do something that would prevent one or other of those companies from exercising its rights for its own benefit, or from receiving any benefit arising from having those rights.

    * (2) It does not matter whether the person has the right, power or option because of the *constitution of one or other of those companies, any agreement or otherwise.

    * (3) However, the right, power or option of an owner of *ownership interests in the *head entity of a *demerger group to *acquire, under a *demerger, ownership interests in the *demerged entity is not a right, power or option covered by subsection (1).

##### 975155  When is an entity a controller (for CGT purposes) of a company?

    * An entity (the **_first entity_**) is a **_controller (for CGT purposes_**) of a company if:

     * (a) the first entity has an *associateinclusive control interest in the company of at least 50%; or

     * (b) the first entity has an associateinclusive control interest in the company of at least 40% and entities other than the first entity or associates of the first entity do not control the company; or

     * (c) the first entity controls the company (alone or with an *associate).

##### 975160  When an entity has an associateinclusive control interest

    * (1) An entity has an **_associateinclusive control interest_** in a company in the circumstances set out in Subdivision A of Division 3 of Part X of the _Income Tax Assessment Act 1936_.

    * (2) However, in working out whether an entity has an associateinclusive control interest of a particular percentage for the purposes of section 975155, there are these modifications to the way Part X of that Act operates:

     * (a) that Part is applied to any company, including one acting as a trustee; and

     * (b) subsection 349(4) applies in all cases in working out which entity holds a direct control interest or a control tracing interest equal to 100%; and

     * (c) subsections 350(6) and (7) and 355(1) are ignored; and

     * (d) despite subsection 352(2), an interposed entity may be taken into account in calculating an indirect control interest if the interposed entity is:

       * (i) a company of which the first entity or an *associate is a controller; or

       * (ii) a partnership or a trust; and

     * (e) section 354 applies as if it referred to partnerships rather than CFP's; and

     * (f) section 355 applies as if it referred to trusts rather than CFT's.

         * Note 1: Part X of the _Income Tax Assessment Act 1936_ defines company to exclude a company in the capacity of a trustee.

         * Note 2: The terms direct control interest and control tracing interest are relevant to working out associateinclusive control interests in a company: see sections 350, 351, 353, 354 and 355 of that Act.

         * Note 3: Under subsection 349(4) of that Act, if 2 or more entities would have a direct control interest or a control tracing interest in a company or trust equal to 100%, only one of them holds the interest.

         * Note 4: Subsections 350(6) and (7) of that Act deal with direct control interests in a company. They deal with interests held by Australian entities. Under subsection 355(1), certain entities are taken to hold a control tracing interest in a trust equal to 100%.

         * Note 5: Paragraphs (2)(d), (e) and (f) of this section are necessary because Part X of the _Income Tax Assessment Act 1936_ applies only to CFE's (which comprise CFC's, CFP's and CFT's).

       * (i) the account was created on or after 1 July 1998;

       * (ii) the first amount credited to the account was an amount of share capital.

    * (2) If a company has more than one account covered by subsection (1), the accounts are taken, for the purposes of this Act, to be a single account.

         * Note: Because the accounts are taken to be a single account (the **_combined share capital account_**), tainting of any of the accounts has the effect of tainting the combined share capital account.

    * (3) However, if a company's *share capital account is *tainted, that account is taken not to be a share capital account for the purposes this Act, other than:

     * (a) subsection 11820(6); and

     * (b) Division 197; and

     * (ba) paragraph 20245(e); and

     * (b) one or more 100% subsidiaries of the holding company; or

     * (c) the holding company and one or more 100% subsidiaries of the holding company.

    * (2) However, the subsidiary company is _not_ a **_100% subsidiary_** of the holding company if a person is *in a position to affect rights, in relation to the subsidiary company, of:

     * (a) the holding company; or

     * (b) a 100% subsidiary of the holding company.

    * (3) The subsidiary company is also not a **_100% subsidiary_** of the holding company if at some future time a person will be *in a position to affect rights as described in subsection (2).

    * (4) A company (other than the subsidiary company) is a **_100% subsidiary_** of the holding company if, and only if:

     * (a) it is a 100% subsidiary of the holding company; or

     * (b) it is a 100% subsidiary of a 100% subsidiary of the holding company;

    * because of any other application or applications of this section.
