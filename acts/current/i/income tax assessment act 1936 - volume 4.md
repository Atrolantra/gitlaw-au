##### Subdivision C--Eligible transferors in relation to trusts

##### 343  Interpretation

    * In this Subdivision, unless the contrary intention appears:

    * **_actual transfer_**, in relation to property or services, means a transfer of the property or services other than a transfer that is taken to have been made because of subsection 345(1), (2), (5), (6), (8), (10) or (11).

    * **_property_** includes money.

    * **_scheme_** has the same meaning as in Division 6AAA of Part III.

    * **_services_** has the same meaning as in Division 6AAA of Part III.

    * **_transfer_** has the same meaning as in Division 6AAA of Part III.

    * **_underlying transfer_**, in relation to a transfer of property or services to a trust, means:

     * (a) if that transfer was an actual transfer--the actual transfer; or

     * (b) if that transfer was taken to have been made because of subsection 345(1)--the actual transfer referred to in that subsection; or

     * (c) if that transfer was taken to have been made because of subsection 345(2)--the actual transfer referred to in paragraph 345(2)(d); or

     * (d) if that transfer was taken to have been made because of subsection 345(5)--the actual transfer referred to in paragraph 345(5)(b); or

     * (e) if that transfer was taken to have been made because of the application of subsection 345(6) or (8) to an actual transfer--the actual transfer; or

     * (f) if that transfer was taken to have been made because of the application of subsection 345(6) or (8) to a transfer that was taken to have been made because of subsection 345(1)--the actual transfer referred to in subsection 345(1); or

     * (g) if that transfer was taken to have been made because of the application of subsection 345(6) or (8) to a transfer that was taken to have been made because of subsection 345(5)--the actual transfer referred to in paragraph 345(5)(b); or

     * (h) if that transfer was taken to have been made because of subsection 345(10)--the actual transfer referred to in paragraph 345(10)(b); or

     * (j) if that transfer was taken to have been made because of one or more applications of subsection 345(11) to an actual transfer--the actual transfer; or

     * (k) if that transfer was taken to have been made because of one or more applications of subsection 345(11) to a transfer (in this paragraph called the **_deemed transfer_**) that was taken to have been made because of subsection 345(1), (2), (5), (6), (8) or (10)--the actual transfer that, under a preceding paragraph of this definition, is the underlying transfer in relation to the deemed transfer.

##### 345  Deemed transfers of property or services

    * (1) For the purposes of this Subdivision, where an entity (in this subsection called the **_prime entity_**) causes another entity to actually transfer property or services to a trust, the prime entity (instead of the other entity) is to be taken to have transferred the property or services to the trust.

##### 346  Circumstances in which a transfer of property or services is an eligible business transaction

    * An underlying transfer of property or services to a trust is an eligible business transaction if, and only if, at or about the time of the transfer, identical or similar property or services were transferred by the transferor in the ordinary course of business to ordinary clients or customers under arm's length transactions in similar circumstances and subject to identical or similar terms and conditions as those that applied in relation to the underlying transfer of the property or services concerned.

##### 347  Eligible transferor in relation to a discretionary trust

    * (1) An entity (in this section called the **_transferor entity_**) is an eligible transferor in relation to a discretionary trust at a particular time (in this section called the **_test time_**) if the trust is not a public unit trust at the test time and:

     * (a) the transferor entity transferred property or services to the trust at or after the IP time and before the test time; and

     * (b) the underlying transfer was made for no consideration or for a consideration less than the arm's length amount in relation to the underlying transfer; and

#### Division 3--Control interests, attribution interests, attributable taxpayers and attribution percentages

##### Subdivision A--Control interests

##### 349  Associateinclusive control interest in a company or trust

    * (1) Subject to this section, the associateinclusive control interest that an entity (in this section called the **_lower entity_**) holds in a company or trust at a particular time is the aggregate of:

     * (a) the direct control interest in the company or trust that the lower entity holds at that time; and

     * (b) the indirect control interests in the company or trust that the lower entity holds at that time; and

     * (c) the direct control interests in the company or trust held at that time by associates of the lower entity; and

      * (i) a direct control interest in the company or trust that is taken into account under paragraph (1)(c); or

      * (ii) an indirect control interest in the company or trust that is taken into account under paragraph (1)(d); and

     * (a) the holding of a direct control interest by the lower entity or any other entity;

     * (b) an entitlement to acquire that direct control interest;

    * only one of those things is to be taken into account.

    * (4) For the purpose of determining any of the following matters:

     * (f) only one of those entities is to be taken to hold a direct control interest, or control tracing interest, as the case may be, in the higher entity equal to 100%; and

     * (g) no other entity (whether or not the entity would, apart from this subsection hold a direct control interest, or control tracing interest, of 100%) is to be taken to hold any direct control interest, or control tracing interest, as the case may be, in the higher entity.

    * (5) For the purpose of calculating the aggregate of the associateinclusive control interests that a group of entities holds in a company or trust:

     * (a) if a particular direct control interest or indirect control interest that an entity holds in another entity would be counted more than once because the entity is an associate of one or more other entities in the group, that interest is to be counted only once; and

     * (b) if both of the following things would, but for this subsection, be counted in calculating the aggregate of the associate inclusive control interests that a group of entities holds in a company or trust:

      * (i) the holding of a direct control interest by an entity;

    * or, if different percentages are applicable under the preceding paragraphs, the greater or greatest of those percentages.

    * (2) If the percentage of total rights to vote or participate in decisionmaking differs as between differing types of decisionmaking, the highest of those percentages applies for the purposes of paragraph (1)(b).

    * (3) For the purposes of the application of subsection (1) to a company, the percentage that an entity holds, or is entitled to acquire, at a particular time (in this subsection called the **_test time_**) in a statutory accounting period of the company, of the total rights to distributions of capital or profits of the company to its shareholders on windingup is to be worked out by:

     * (a) ascertaining whichever of the following is applicable:

      * (i) the capital of the company as at the end of the statutory accounting period;

      * (ii) the profits of the company for the statutory accounting period; and

      * (i) at the end of the statutory accounting period instead of at the test time; and

      * (ii) on that assumption.

    * (6) If, at a particular time, a company is controlled by a group of 5 or fewer Australian entities, either alone or together with associates (whether or not any associate is also an Australian entity), each Australian entity in that group of 5 or fewer holds a direct control interest in the company equal to 100%.

    * (7) An entity that holds a direct control interest in a company at a particular time because of subsection (6) is not to be taken to hold any direct control interest in the company at that time because of subsection (1).

##### 351  Direct control interest in a trust

    * (1) An entity that is a beneficiary in a trust holds a direct control interest in the trust at a particular time equal to:

     * (a) the percentage of the income of the trust represented by the share of the income to which the beneficiary is entitled, or that the beneficiary is entitled to acquire; or

     * (b) the percentage of the corpus of the trust represented by the share of the corpus to which the beneficiary is entitled, or that the beneficiary is entitled to acquire;

##### 352  Indirect control interest in a company or trust

    * (1) An indirect control interest that an entity (in this section called the **_bottom entity_**) holds in a company or trust at a particular time is calculated in accordance with this section.

    * (2) An interposed entity is not to be taken into account in calculating an indirect control interest unless the entity is a CFE.

    * (3) If there is only one entity interposed between the bottom entity and the company or trust, the indirect control interest is calculated by multiplying the control tracing interest that the bottom entity holds in the interposed entity by the control tracing interest that the interposed entity holds in the company or trust.

    * (4) If there are 2 entities interposed between the bottom entity and the company or trust, the indirect control interest is calculated:

     * (a) by multiplying the control tracing interest that the bottom entity holds in the first interposed entity by the control tracing interest that the first interposed entity holds in the second interposed entity; and

     * (b) by multiplying the result of the calculation referred to in paragraph (a) by the control tracing interest that the second interposed entity holds in the company or trust.

    * (5) If there are 3 or more entities interposed between the bottom entity and the company or trust, the indirect control interest is calculated:

     * (a) by multiplying the control tracing interest that the bottom entity holds in the first interposed entity by the control tracing interest that the first interposed entity holds in the second interposed entity; and

     * (b) by multiplying the result of the calculation referred to in paragraph (a) by the control tracing interest that the second interposed entity holds in the third interposed entity;

    * and so on, ending with a multiplication by the control tracing interest that the last interposed entity holds in the company or trust.

    * (6) For the purposes of this section, an entity (in this subsection called the **_second entity_**) is interposed between 2 other entities (in this subsection called the **_first entity_** and the **_third entity_** respectively) if, and only if:

     * (a) the first entity has a control tracing interest in the second entity; and

     * (b) the second entity has a control tracing interest in the third entity.

##### 353  Control tracing interest in a company

    * (1) Subject to this section, an entity (in this subsection called the **_lower entity_**) holds a control tracing interest in a company at a particular time equal to the direct control interest in the company that the lower entity holds at that time.

    * (2) An entity (in this subsection called the **_lower entity_**) holds a control tracing interest in a company at a particular time equal to 100% if:

     * (a) the aggregate of the direct control interests in the company held at that time by the lower entity and its associates is not less than 50%; or

     * (b) both of the following conditions are satisfied:

    * (4) If there are 2 entities interposed between the bottom entity and the top entity, the indirect attribution account interest is calculated:

     * (a) by multiplying the direct attribution account interest that the bottom entity holds in the first interposed entity by the direct attribution account interest that the first interposed entity holds in the second interposed entity; and

     * (b) by multiplying the result of the calculation in paragraph (a) by the direct attribution account interest that the second interposed entity holds in the top entity.

    * (5) If there are 3 or more entities interposed between the bottom entity and the top entity, the indirect attribution account interest is calculated:

     * (a) by multiplying the direct attribution account interest that the bottom entity holds in the first interposed entity by the direct attribution account interest that the first interposed entity holds in the second interposed entity; and

     * (b) by multiplying the result of the multiplication referred to in paragraph (a) by the direct attribution account interest that the second interposed entity holds in the third interposed entity;

    * and so on, ending with a multiplication by the direct attribution account interest that the last interposed entity holds in the top entity.

    * (6) For the purposes of this section, an entity (in this subsection called the **_second entity_**) is interposed between 2 other entities (in this subsection called the **_first entity_** and the **_third entity_** respectively) if, and only if:

     * (a) the first entity has a direct attribution account interest in the second entity; and

     * (b) the second entity has a direct attribution account interest in the third entity.

##### 370  Attribution surplus

    * An attribution surplus for an attribution account entity in relation to a taxpayer exists at a particular time if the entity's total attribution credits arising before that time in relation to the taxpayer exceed its total attribution debits arising before that time in relation to the taxpayer.

##### 371  Attribution credit

    * (1) An attribution credit arises for an attribution account entity (in this section called the **_eligible entity_**) in relation to a taxpayer if:

     * (a) an amount is included in the taxpayer's assessable income under section 456 in respect of the attributable income of the eligible entity for a statutory accounting period; or

     * (b) an amount is included in the taxpayer's assessable income under section 457 as a result of a change of residence by the eligible entity; or

     * (d) an attribution account payment that requires an attribution debit for another entity in relation to the taxpayer is made to the eligible entity.

    * (2) Subject to subsection (4), the amount of the attribution credit is equal to the amount included in assessable income or to the amount of the attribution debit, as the case may be.

    * (4) Where:

     * (a) the attribution credit arises under paragraph (1)(d) in relation to an attribution account payment consisting of a nonportfolio dividend paid to the eligible entity, where the eligible entity is a company; and

     * (b) the eligible entity is or will be liable to pay an amount of foreign tax on the attribution account payment or on amounts that include the attribution account payment;

    * then the amount of the attribution credit is reduced by the amount calculated using the formula: 

    * where: 

    * **_Attribution account percentage_**  means the taxpayer's attribution account percentage for the attribution account entity.

    * **_Foreign tax_**  means the amount of foreign tax, to the extent that it is attributable to the attribution account payment.

    * (5) The attribution credit arises:

     * (a) in a paragraph (1)(a) case where subsection 319(6) does not apply to the statutory accounting period referred to in that paragraph--at the end of the statutory accounting period; or

     * (aaa) in a paragraph (1)(a) case where subsection 319(6) applies to the statutory accounting period referred to in that paragraph--at the beginning of the statutory accounting period; or

     * (b) in a paragraph (1)(b) case--subject to subsection (8), at the time of the change of residence referred to in that paragraph; or

     * (d) in a paragraph (1)(d) case--when the attribution account payment referred to in that paragraph is made.

    * (6) Where, apart from this subsection, an attribution credit would arise in relation to an attribution account entity for an Australian partnership or an Australian trust in respect of an amount included in the assessable income of the partnership or trust of a year of income under section 456 or 457, then, subject to subsection (7):

     * (a) the attribution credit does not arise for the partnership or trust; and

     * (b) an attribution credit arises in relation to the attribution account entity for:

      * (i) any taxpayer for whom, as a result of the amount being so included, a tax detriment would arise in circumstances referred to in paragraphs 460(2)(a) and (b) or paragraphs 460(3)(a) and (b); and

      * (ii) any taxpayer where, as a result of the amount being so included, a tax detriment would arise for the trustee of a trust in which the taxpayer is a beneficiary, in respect of an amount assessable to the trustee under section 98 in respect of the taxpayer's share of the net income of the trust, in circumstances referred to in paragraph 460(4)(a); and

      * (iii) any taxpayer in the capacity of trustee of a trust, where, as a result of the amount being so included, a tax detriment would arise for the taxpayer in respect of an amount assessable to the taxpayer under section 99 or 99A, in circumstances referred to in paragraph 460(4)(a); and

     * (c) the amount of the attribution credit referred to in paragraph (b) equals the amount of the tax detriment, as reduced by any application of section 460; and

     * (d) the attribution credit referred to in paragraph (b) arises at the time when the attribution credit referred to in paragraph (a) would, but for this subsection, have arisen.

    * (7) Subsection (6) does not apply to an Australian trust that is, in relation to the year of income referred to in that subsection:

     * (a) a corporate unit trust within the meaning of Division 6B of Part III; or

     * (b) a public trading trust within the meaning of Division 6C of that Part; or

     * (c) a complying superannuation fund, a noncomplying superannuation fund, a complying approved deposit fund, a noncomplying approved deposit fund or a pooled superannuation trust.

    * (8) If:

     * (a) a company ceases to be resident in an unlisted country and becomes a resident of a listed country; and

     * (b) an amount (in this subsection called the **_section 457 amount_**) is included in a taxpayer's assessable income under section 457 as a result of the change of residence; and

     * (c) a particular part (in this subsection called the **_eligible part_**) of the section 457 amount is attributable to a hypothetical disposal of a particular asset of the company at the residence change time; and

     * (d) it might reasonably be expected that, if and when the company actually disposes of the asset, so much of the gain derived by the company on the actual disposal of the asset that accrued before the residence change time will be subject to tax in the listed country;

    * the taxpayer may elect to defer the timing of so much of the paragraph (1)(b) attribution credit as is attributable to the eligible part from the time of the change of residence referred to in that paragraph until immediately before the payment by the company of a dividend out of the gain derived by the company on the actual disposal of the asset.

    * (9) An election for the purposes of subsection (8):

     * (b) is irrevocable; and

     * (c) has no effect unless it is made:

      * (i) within 6 months after the end of the later of the following years of income:

         * (A) the year of income in which the residence change time took place;

         * (B) the year of income in which this subsection commenced; or

      * (ii) within such further period as the Commissioner allows.

##### 372  Attribution debit

    * (1) An attribution debit arises for an attribution account entity (in this section called the **_eligible entity_**) in relation to a taxpayer if:

     * (a) the eligible entity makes an attribution account payment to the taxpayer or to another attribution account entity; and

     * (b) immediately before the eligible entity makes the attribution account payment, there is an attribution surplus for the eligible entity in relation to the taxpayer.

    * (2) Subject to subsection (4), the amount of the debit is the lesser of:

     * (a) the attribution surplus; and

     * (b) whichever of the following is applicable:

      * (i) if the attribution account payment is made to the taxpayer--the attribution account payment;

      * (ii) in any other case--the taxpayer's attribution account percentage (for the attribution account entity to which the payment is made) of the attribution account payment.

    * (4) Where:

     * (a) the attribution account payment is made to an attribution account entity that is a trust; and

     * (b) the attribution surplus, for the eligible entity, is in relation to the taxpayer in the capacity of trustee of the trust (because it is a surplus that resulted from an attribution credit or credits that arose under subparagraph 371(6)(b)(iii));

    * then the amount of the attribution debit is the lesser of: 

     * (c) the attribution surplus; and

     * (d) any amount assessable to the taxpayer under section 99 or 99A in relation to the net income of the trust of the year of income in which the attribution account payment is made.

    * (5) The attribution debit arises when the attribution account payment is made.

##### 373  Grossedup amount of an attribution debit

    * The grossedup amount in relation to an attribution debit is: 

     * (a) where subparagraph 372(2)(b)(i) applied in relation to the debit--the amount of the debit; or

     * (b) where subparagraph 372(2)(b)(ii) applied in relation to the debit--the amount of the debit, divided by the attribution account percentage referred to in that subparagraph.

#### Division 7--Calculation of attributable income of CFC

##### Subdivision A--Basic principles

##### 381  Separate attributable income for each attributable taxpayer

    * Where, at the end of a statutory accounting period (in this Division called the **_eligible period_**) of a company:

     * (a) the company is a CFC; and

     * (b) there are one or more attributable taxpayers in relation to the company;

    * the attributable income of the company (in this Division called the **_eligible CFC_**) for the eligible period is calculated separately for each such attributable taxpayer (in this Division called the **_eligible taxpayer_**) in accordance with this Division.

##### 382  Attributable income is taxable income calculated on certain assumptions

    * (1) The attributable income is the amount that would be the eligible CFC's taxable income for the eligible period if certain assumptions were made.

    * (2) For the purposes of describing those assumptions, amounts of assessable income, allowable deductions and exempt income that are to be taken into account in calculating the taxable income are referred to respectively as notional assessable income, notional allowable deductions and notional exempt income.

##### 383  Basic assumptions

    * The assumptions are: 

     * (a) that the eligible CFC is a taxpayer and a resident, within the meaning of section 6, during the whole of the eligible period; and

     * (b) that the eligible period is a year of income, being the year of income of the eligible taxpayer in which the eligible period ends; and

     * (c) that this Act is modified in accordance with Subdivisions B to E; and

     * (d) whichever of the assumptions in section 384 or 385 applies.

##### 384  Additional assumption for unlisted country CFC

    * (1) Where the eligible CFC is a resident of an unlisted country at the end of the eligible period, it is to be assumed:

     * (a) that the only amounts of notional assessable income are those to which subsection (2) applies; and

     * (b) that all other income is notional exempt income.

    * (2) The amounts of notional assessable income are:

     * (a) where the eligible CFC does not pass the active income test for the eligible period in relation to the eligible taxpayer--amounts that would be included in its notional assessable income for the eligible period under this Act as modified in accordance with Subdivisions B to E if the only income or other amounts derived by it during the eligible period, and any earlier statutory accounting period, were adjusted tainted income (within the meaning of section 386); and

     * (b) amounts included in the notional assessable income of the eligible CFC for the eligible period under section 102AAZD of this Act as modified in accordance with Subdivisions B to E; and

     * (c) amounts included in the notional assessable income of the eligible CFC for the eligible period under Division 6 of Part III of this Act as so modified; and

     * (d) amounts that would be included in the notional assessable income of the eligible CFC for the eligible period under Division 5 of Part III of this Act, as modified in accordance with Subdivisions B to E of this Division, in relation to any partnership if its net income included only:

      * (i) where the eligible CFC does not pass the active income test for the eligible period in relation to the eligible taxpayer--amounts that would be included if the partnership derived only adjusted tainted income (within the meaning of section 386); and

      * (ii) amounts included under section 102AAZD of this Act as modified in accordance with Subdivisions B to E of this Division; and

      * (iii) amounts included under Division 6 of Part III of this Act as so modified.

##### 385  Additional assumption for listed country CFC

    * (1) Where the eligible CFC is a resident of a listed country at the end of the eligible period, it is to be assumed:

     * (a) that the only amounts of notional assessable income are those to which subsection (2) applies; and

     * (b) that all other income is notional exempt income.

    * (2) Subject to subsection (4), the amounts of notional assessable income are:

     * (a) amounts that would be included in the notional assessable income of the eligible CFC for the eligible period under this Act as modified in accordance with Subdivisions B to D if the only income or other amounts derived during the eligible period, and any earlier statutory accounting period, by the eligible CFC were:

      * (i) where the eligible CFC does not pass the active income test for the eligible period in relation to the eligible taxpayer--adjusted tainted income (within the meaning of section 386) that is eligible designated concession income in relation to the listed country or any other listed country; and

      * (ii) income or other amounts, of a kind specified in the regulations, that:

         * (A) are not eligible designated concession income of the eligible CFC in relation to the listed country or any other listed country; and

         * (B) are not treated as derived from sources in the listed country for the purposes of the tax law of the listed country; and

         * (C) pass the test set out in subsection (2A); and

     * (b) amounts included in the notional assessable income of the eligible CFC for the eligible period under section 102AAZD of this Act as modified in accordance with Subdivisions B to D; and

     * (c) amounts included in the notional assessable income of the eligible CFC for the eligible period under Division 6 of Part III of this Act as so modified, where either of the following conditions (but not necessarily the same condition) is satisfied in relation to the listed country and each other listed country:

      * (i) the amounts are not subject to tax in that listed country in a tax accounting period ending before the end of the eligible period or commencing during the eligible period;

      * (ii) the amounts are subject to tax in that listed country in such a tax accounting period and are designated concession income in relation to the listed country; and

     * (d) amounts that would be included in the notional assessable income of the eligible CFC for the eligible period under Division 5 of Part III of this Act, as modified in accordance with Subdivisions B to D of this Division, in relation to any partnership if its net income included only:

      * (i) where the eligible CFC does not pass the active income test for the eligible period in relation to the eligible taxpayer--amounts that would be included if the partnership derived only adjusted tainted income (within the meaning of section 386) that is eligible designated concession income in relation to the listed country or any other listed country; and

      * (ii) amounts that would be included if the partnership derived only income or other amounts, of a kind specified in the regulations, that:

         * (A) are not eligible designated concession income of the partnership in relation to the listed country or any other listed country; and

         * (B) are not treated as derived from sources in the listed country for the purposes of the tax law of the listed country; and

         * (C) pass the test set out in subsection (2A); and

      * (iii) amounts included under section 102AAZD of this Act as modified in accordance with Subdivisions B to D of this Division; and

      * (iv) amounts included under Division 6 of Part III of this Act as so modified, where either of the following conditions (but not necessarily the same condition) is satisfied in relation to the listed country and each other listed country:

         * (A) the amounts are not subject to tax in that listed country in a tax accounting period ending before the end of the eligible period or commencing during the eligible period;

         * (B) the amounts are subject to tax in that listed country in such a tax accounting period and are designated concession income in relation to the listed country.

    * (2A) For the purposes of subsubparagraphs (2)(a)(ii)(C) and (2)(d)(ii)(C), income or other amounts pass the test set out in this subsection if both:

     * (a) the income or other amounts are adjusted tainted income (within the meaning of section 386); and

     * (b) the income or other amounts are not subject to tax in the listed country or in any other listed country in a tax accounting period ending before the end of the eligible period or commencing during the eligible period.

    * (3) For the purposes of paragraph (2)(c) or (d), a reference in that paragraph to an amount being not subject to tax or subject to tax, as the case may be, includes a reference to another amount included in the net income of a partnership or trust, to which the firstmentioned amount is attributable, being not subject to tax or subject to tax.

    * (4) Where the sum of the amounts to which paragraph (2)(a) would otherwise apply does not exceed the lesser of:

     * (a) $50,000; and

     * (b) 5% of the gross turnover of the eligible CFC for the eligible period;

    * then that paragraph does not apply to those amounts.

    * (5) In determining for the purposes of paragraph (4)(b) the gross turnover of the eligible CFC for the eligible period, section 434 has effect as if:

     * (a) subparagraph 434(1)(a)(i) were omitted; and

     * (b) the words ", but not including amounts that are shown in those recognised accounts as amounts covered by section 436" were omitted from paragraphs 434(1)(b), (c) and (d); and

     * (c) the words "(other than an exclusion of amounts shown in those recognised accounts as amounts covered by section 436)" were omitted from subsection 434(2).

##### 386  Adjusted tainted income

    * (1) The references in sections 384, 385 and 457 to adjusted tainted income are references to amounts that would be passive income, tainted sales income or tainted services income if certain modifications were made to the provisions of Division 8.

    * (2) The modifications are:

     * (a) that paragraphs 446(1)(k), (m) and (n) are replaced with the following:

      * "(k)	amounts derived from the disposal of tainted assets;

      * (m) amounts derived from the disposal of tainted commodity investments;

      * (n) amounts derived that are attributable to currency exchange rate fluctuations, except where under section 439 the amounts would, if they were currency exchange gains, relate to an active income transaction;"; and

     * (b) that paragraph 446(1)(k) as so replaced does not apply to an amount derived from the disposal of a tainted asset in the circumstances referred to in paragraphs 450(2)(a) to (c) or (5)(a) to (c); and

     * (c) that paragraph 446(1)(n) as so replaced does not apply to an amount derived where, if it were a currency exchange gain, paragraphs 450(3)(a) and (b) would apply to it; and

     * (d) that the reference in subsection 450(7) to net gains that accrued to the company in respect of the disposal of tainted assets is replaced with a reference to amounts derived by the company from the disposal of tainted assets.

##### 387  Reduction of attributable income because of interim dividends

    * (1) Where:

     * (a) during the eligible period, the eligible CFC pays a dividend to the eligible taxpayer or to another entity; and

     * (b) if the dividend is paid to the eligible taxpayer--the whole or part of the dividend is included in the assessable income of the eligible taxpayer of a year of income; and

     * (d) the whole or part of the grossedup assessable component of the dividend may reasonably be regarded as having been paid out of the attributable income of the eligible CFC for the eligible period;

    * then, for the purposes of this Part, the attributable income of the eligible CFC for the eligible period in relation to the eligible taxpayer is reduced by an amount equal to the whole or the part of the grossedup assessable component of the dividend.

    * (2) In this section:

    * **_grossedup assessable component_**, in relation to a dividend the whole or part of which is included in the assessable income of the eligible taxpayer, means the amount of the whole or the part divided by the eligible taxpayer's attribution percentage for the eligible CFC at the time of payment of the dividend.

##### Subdivision B--General modifications of Australian tax law

##### 388  Double tax agreements to be disregarded

    * then the interest equivalent is a notional allowable deduction for the eligible period.

##### 395  Expenditure incurred to produce income or profits in later statutory accounting periods

    * In determining whether expenditure incurred by the eligible CFC during the eligible period for the purpose of gaining or producing income or profits in a later statutory accounting period is a notional allowable deduction under a particular provision, it is to be assumed that:

     * (b) the debt was created or acquired in the ordinary course of a moneylending business of the eligible CFC that carries on that business; and

     * (c) assuming that income:

      * (i) that has been derived by the eligible CFC in respect of the debt; or

      * (ii) that would have been reasonably likely to have been derived by the eligible CFC in respect of the debt if it had not become bad;

     * were instead derived by the eligible CFC during periods to which it may reasonably be attributed, there would be a part or parts (which part or the total of which parts is in this subsection called the**_ notional exempt income period_**) of the period (in this subsection called the **_eligible debt holding period_**) beginning when the debt was so created or acquired, and ending when it was written off, in respect of which some or all of that income would not be included in the notional assessable income of the eligible CFC for any statutory accounting period;

    * then only a proportion of the amount referred to in paragraph (a) is a notional allowable deduction, being the proportion calculated using the following formula: 

    * where: 

    * **_Eligible debt holding period_** means the number of days in the eligible debt holding period.

    * **_Notional exempt income period_** means the number of days in the notional exempt income period.

     * (a) where a debt that is written off was acquired from another person, the creation and any previous acquisition of the debt is to be disregarded, other than for the purposes of paragraph (2)(e); and

     * (b) if, on the assumption in paragraph (2)(c), income would be derived by the eligible CFC during a period before the first statutory accounting period of the eligible CFC beginning on or after 1 July 1990, then, in spite of anything in that paragraph, that income is taken not to be included in the notional assessable income of the eligible CFC for any statutory accounting period; and

     * (c) it is to be assumed that, for any statutory accounting period for which there is no requirement to calculate the attributable income of the eligible CFC in relation to the eligible taxpayer, there is such a requirement.

    * (4) Where a part of a debt is written off as bad, the preceding provisions of this section apply as if the part were an entire debt that is written off as bad.

    * (5) This section has the same effect in relation to an allowable deduction under section 63E in respect of the whole or part of a debt that is extinguished as it has in relation to an allowable deduction under section 81 or 2535  of the _Income Tax Assessment Act 1997_ in respect of the whole or part of a debt that is written off as bad.

      * (i) there is an attribution surplus for the disposal entity in relation to the eligible taxpayer;

      * (ii) there is an attribution surplus for one or more other attribution account entities in relation to the eligible taxpayer, where each such entity is one in which the eligible taxpayer has an indirect attribution account interest held through the disposal entity;

    * then: 

     * (c) for the purpose of calculating the attributable income, the consideration or capital proceeds that, apart from this section, would be taken into account under the provision referred to in paragraph (a) in respect of the disposal or CGT event is, subject to subsection (3), taken to be reduced by the grossedup amount of the attribution surplus, or the sum of the grossedup amounts of the attribution surpluses, as the case requires; and

     * (c) where there is only one attribution surplus referred to in that paragraph and (after any application of paragraph (b) of this subsection) its grossedup amount exceeds the consideration in respect of the disposal or the capital proceeds from the CGT event, then the surplus is only to be taken into account to the extent that its grossedup amount equals the consideration or those capital proceeds; and

     * (d) where there are 2 or more attribution surpluses referred to in paragraph (1)(c) and (after any application of paragraph (b) of this subsection) the sum of their grossedup amounts exceeds the consideration in respect of the disposal or the capital proceeds from the CGT event, then:

      * (i) if the taxpayer makes an election that for the purposes of this paragraph, a part of each surplus (after any application of paragraph (b)) such that the sum of the grossedup amounts of the parts to which the election relates equals the consideration or those capital proceeds--only the part to which the election relates of each surplus is to be taken into account under paragraph (1)(c); or

      * (ii) if subparagraph (i) does not apply--only a proportion of each surplus (after any application of paragraph (b)) is to be taken into account under paragraph (1)(c), being the proportion calculated using the formula:

      * where: 

      * **_consideration _**means the amount of the consideration or the capital proceeds.

     * (a) an attribution debit is taken to arise at the time of the disposal under section 372, in relation to the eligible taxpayer, for each attribution account entity (in this section called a **_surplus entity_**) in relation to which there is an attribution surplus to which paragraph (1)(c) applies; and

     * (b) the amount of the attribution debit is equal to so much of the surplus as is taken into account under paragraph (1)(c); and

     * (c) there is no grossedup amount in relation to the attribution debit under section 373; and

     * (d) an attribution credit equal to the debit is taken to arise, at the time of the disposal or of the CGT event, under section 371 for the eligible CFC in relation to the eligible taxpayer.

    * (6A) In determining, for the purposes of this section, whether there was an attribution surplus immediately before a CGT event, and the amount of such a surplus, also take into account any attribution credit that later arises because the CGT event caused section 104175 of the _Income Tax Assessment Act 1997_ (as it notionally applies to the CGT event entity under this Division) to operate.

    * (7) In this section:

    * **_interest_**, in relation to an attribution account entity, means:

    * **_total asset profits_** is the sum of the profits that the eligible CFC would have made if all its assets were disposed of at the residency change time for their market values (ignoring disposals that would not result in a profit).

    * Increase in capital proceeds

    * (6) If all the eligible CFC's assets were disposed of at the residency change time for their market values in the circumstances mentioned in subparagraph 457(2)(a)(ii):

     * (a) the distributable profits of the eligible CFC would be reduced by an amount (the **_distributable profit reduction amount_**); and

     * (b) the eligible CFC would have made a loss (the **_CFC asset loss_**) on the disposal of the CFC asset.

    * (7) The capital proceeds are increased by:

    * where: 

    * **_total asset losses_** is the sum of the losses that the eligible CFC would have made if all its assets were disposed of at the residency change time for their market values (ignoring disposals that would not result in a loss).

##### 423  Adjustment of capital proceeds where section 47A applies to rolledover assets

    * (1) For the purposes of applying this Act in calculating the attributable income of the eligible CFC, in relation to the eligible period in relation to the eligible taxpayer, the following provision has effect.

    * (2) The capital proceeds from a CGT event that happens in relation to a CGT asset of the eligible CFC during the eligible period are reduced if:

     * (a) either:

      * (i) because of Division 17 of former Part IIIA of this Act, that Part did not apply to the disposal of the asset to the eligible CFC by another CFC during the eligible period or an earlier statutory accounting period; or

      * (ii) there was a rollover under Division 122, 124 or 126 of the _Income Tax Assessment Act 1997_ (except under Subdivision 124J, 124K or 124L of that Act) for a CGT event (the **_earlier CGT event_**) that happened during that period in relation to the asset and involving the eligible CFC and another CFC; and

     * (b) the eligible taxpayer was an attributable taxpayer in relation to both CFC's at the time of the disposal or the earlier CGT event; and

     * (c) the other CFC is taken, under section 47A of this Act, to have paid the eligible CFC a dividend in relation to the disposal or the earlier CGT event; and

     * (d) an amount is included in the attributable taxpayer's assessable income in respect of the dividend under section 456 of this Act.

    * (3) The reduction is the lesser of:

     * (a) the amount of the dividend; and

     * (b) the amount of any capital gain that:

      * (i) apart from Division 17 of former Part IIIA of this Act, would have accrued to the other CFC in respect of the disposal if the consideration in respect of the disposal had been the market value of the asset at the time of the disposal; or

      * (ii) the other CFC would have made from the earlier CGT event apart from the rollover if the capital proceeds from that event had been the market value of the asset at the time of that event.

##### Subdivision D--Modifications relating to losses

##### 425  Sometimesexempt income etc.

    * (1) Where an amount is not included in the eligible CFC's notional assessable income for a statutory accounting period (being the eligible period or an earlier period) in relation to the eligible taxpayer because:

     * (a) the eligible CFC passes the active income test for the period in relation to the eligible taxpayer; or

     * (b) subsection 385 (4) applies;

    * then the amount is sometimesexempt income of the eligible CFC for the period in relation to the eligible taxpayer.

    * (2) Where an amount would, disregarding section 431, only be a notional allowable deduction of the eligible CFC for a statutory accounting period (being the eligible period or an earlier period) in relation to the eligible taxpayer if the eligible CFC's sometimesexempt income for the period in relation to the eligible taxpayer were instead notional assessable income, then the amount is a sometimesexempt deduction of the eligible CFC for the period in relation to the eligible taxpayer.

    * (3) Where the eligible CFC's sometimesexempt deductions for a statutory accounting period (being the eligible period or an earlier period) in relation to the eligible taxpayer exceed its sometimesexempt income for the period in relation to the taxpayer, the excess is a (sometimesexempt income) loss of the eligible CFC for the period in relation to the eligible taxpayer.

    * (4) Where an eligible CFC's sometimesexempt income for a statutory accounting period (being the eligible period or an earlier period) in relation to the eligible taxpayer exceeds its sometimesexempt deductions for the period in relation to the taxpayer, the excess is a (sometimesexempt income) gain of the eligible CFC for the period in relation to the eligible taxpayer.

##### 426  Creation of loss

    * For the purposes of this Subdivision, if:

     * (a) the amount of the eligible CFC's notional allowable deductions (other than under section 431) for a statutory accounting period (being the eligible period or an earlier period) are applied as follows:

      * (i) they are applied first against any notional assessable income of the eligible CFC class for the period;

      * (ii) any excess is then applied against any (sometimesexempt income) gain for the period; and

     * (b) there is any amount remaining;

    * then the amount remaining is a loss of the eligible CFC for the period.

##### 427  Certain provisions to be disregarded

    * For the purposes of applying this Act and the _Income Tax Assessment Act 1997_ in calculating the attributable income of an eligible CFC, disregard the following:

     * (b) Division 36, section 165120 and Subdivisions 170A, 709D and 719I of the _Income Tax Assessment Act 1997_ (except for the purpose of a reference to any of those provisions in any other provision of this Act, as applied in accordance with this Division);

     * (ba) Subdivisions 165CC and 165CD of the _Income Tax Assessment Act 1997_.

##### 428  Subdivision to apply as if there were always a requirement to calculate attributable income

    * For the purposes of applying this Subdivision in calculating the attributable income of the eligible CFC for the eligible period, it is to be assumed that, for any earlier statutory accounting period (when the eligible CFC existed) for which there was no requirement to calculate its attributable income in relation to the eligible taxpayer, there were such a requirement (except for the purpose of applying section 398).

##### 429  Notional allowable deduction for (sometimesexempt income) loss

    * The amount of any (sometimesexempt income) loss of the eligible CFC for the eligible period class is a notional allowable deduction for the period from the notional assessable income of the eligible CFC.

##### 431  Deduction etc. for previous period loss

    * (1) Where there are one or more losses of the eligible CFC of any statutory accounting period before the eligible period, the losses, to the extent they have not been previously taken into account under this section in respect of any such period, are to be taken into account in accordance with this section.

    * (2) The losses are to be taken into account as follows:

     * (a) they are to be applied first against any (sometimesexempt income) gain for the eligible period, to the extent that the gain has not already been applied under section 426 in determining whether there is a loss for the eligible period;

     * (b) any excess is then a notional allowable deduction for the eligible period, but only to the extent that the deduction does not exceed the amount of the notional assessable income for the period as reduced by notional allowable deductions other than under this section;

     * (c) where there are 2 or more losses, they are to be taken into account in the order in which they arose.

    * (3) A loss for a statutory accounting period is only to be taken into account under subsection (2) if the eligible CFC was a CFC at the end of that statutory accounting period and each following statutory accounting period before the eligible period.

    * (4) A loss for a statutory accounting period is to be taken into account under subsection (2) only if:

     * (a) where the eligible CFC is a resident of a listed country at the end of the eligible period:

      * (i) the eligible CFC is a resident of a listed country at the end of that statutory accounting period; and

      * (ii) if there are any statutory accounting periods (the **_intervening periods_**) occurring between that statutory accounting period and the eligible period--the eligible CFC was a resident of a listed country at the end of each of the intervening periods; or

     * (b) where the eligible CFC is a resident of an unlisted country at the end of the eligible period:

      * (i) the eligible CFC is a resident of an unlisted country at the end of that statutory accounting period; and

      * (ii) if there are any statutory accounting periods (also the **_intervening periods_**) occurring between that statutory accounting period and the eligible period--the eligible CFC was a resident of an unlisted country at the end of each of the intervening periods.

    * (4A) If:

     * (a) at the end of both the eligible period and of a prior statutory accounting period, the eligible CFC was a resident of the same country; and

     * (b) the country was either:

      * (i) a listed country at the end of the eligible period and an unlisted country at the end of that statutory accounting period; or

      * (ii) an unlisted country at the end of the eligible period and a listed country at the end of that statutory accounting period;

    * subsection (4) does not prevent a loss for that statutory accounting period, or an earlier statutory accounting period, from being taken into account under subsection (2).

    * (4B) If:

     * (a) the eligible CFC is a resident of an unlisted country at the end of the eligible period; and

     * (b) that country emerged from the dissolution of another country; and

     * (c) the other country was in existence at the end of a prior statutory accounting period; and

     * (d) at the end of that statutory accounting period, the CFC was a resident of the other country; and

     * (e) the other country was a listed country at the end of that statutory accounting period;

    * subsection (4) does not prevent a loss for that statutory accounting period, or an earlier statutory accounting period, from being taken into account under subsection (2).

    * (4D) If:

     * (a) as a result of the operation of subsection (4), a loss of a CFC for a statutory accounting period was not taken into account under subsection (2) in calculating the attributable income of the CFC for a later statutory accounting period (the **_second statutory accounting period_**); and

     * (b) the eligible period is later than the second statutory accounting period;

    * then, despite anything in subsection (4), (4A) or (4B), the loss is not to be taken into account under subsection (2) in calculating the attributable income of the CFC for the eligible period.

    * (5) A loss for a statutory accounting period is not to be taken into account under subsection (2) if, assuming that it were a tax loss (within the meaning of the _Income Tax Assessment Act 1997_) of the eligible CFC, it would not be taken into account or allowed as a deduction in relation to the eligible period.

#### Division 8--Active income test

##### Subdivision A--Basic conditions for passing the active income test

##### 432  Active income test

    * (1) Subject to sections 437 and 453, for the purposes of this Part, a company is taken to pass the active income test in relation to a statutory accounting period if, and only if:

     * (a) the company was in existence at the end of the statutory accounting period; and

     * (b) there was no time during the statutory accounting period when the company was in existence when the company was neither a resident of a particular listed country nor of a particular unlisted country; and

     * (c) the company has kept accounts for the statutory accounting period and:

      * (i) the accounts are prepared in accordance with commercially accepted accounting principles; and

      * (ii) the accounts give a true and fair view of the financial position of the company; and

     * (d) the company has complied with the substantiation requirements set out in section 451 in relation to the statutory accounting period; and

     * (e) at all times during the statutory accounting period when the company was in existence and was a resident of a particular listed country, or of a particular unlisted country, the company carried on business in that country at or through a permanent establishment of the company in that country; and

     * (f) the tainted income ratio of the company for the statutory accounting period is less than 0.05.

    * (3) For the purposes of this section, if a company was dormant, within the meaning of Part VI of the _Companies Act 1981_, throughout a particular period (in this subsection called the **_dormant period_**) commencing on the day on which the company was incorporated, the company is to be taken not to have been in existence during the dormant period.

##### Subdivision B--Tainted income ratio

##### 433  Tainted income ratio

    * (1) For the purposes of this Part, if a company is a resident of a particular listed country or a particular unlisted country at the end of a statutory accounting period, the tainted income ratio of the company for the statutory accounting period is calculated using the formula: 

    * where: 

    * **_Gross tainted turnover_** means the gross tainted turnover of the company of the statutory accounting period.

    * **_Gross turnover_** means the gross turnover of the company of the statutory accounting period.

    * (3) For the purposes of this Part, the tainted income ratio of a company for a statutory accounting period is taken to be less than 0.05 if both the numerator and the denominator in the applicable fraction are 0.

    * (4) For the purposes of this Part, the tainted income ratio of a company for a statutory accounting period is to be calculated in the currency in which the profit and loss accounts and the balancesheet of the company for the statutory accounting period are prepared.

##### 434  Gross turnover

    * (1) Subject to section 437, for the purposes of this Part, the gross turnover of a company of a statutory accounting period is the sum of:

     * (a) the amount that is shown in the recognised accounts of the company for the statutory accounting period as the gross revenue derived by the company, but not including:

      * (i) amounts that are shown in those recognised accounts as amounts covered by section 436; or

      * (ii) amounts that are shown in those recognised accounts as revenue in respect of the disposal of assets (other than trading stock or commodity futures contracts, commodity forward contracts or rights or options in respect of such contracts); or

      * (iii) amounts that are shown in those recognised accounts as revenue from disposing of commodity futures contracts, commodity forward contracts or rights or options in respect of such contracts; or

      * (iv) amounts that are shown in those recognised accounts as revenue from currency exchange rate fluctuations; and

     * (b) the amount that is shown in the recognised accounts of the company for the statutory accounting period as the amount (if any) by which the sum of the gains derived by the company in the statutory accounting period in respect of the disposal of assets (other than trading stock or commodity futures contracts, commodity forward contracts or rights or options in respect of such contracts) exceeds the losses incurred by the company in the statutory accounting period in respect of the disposal of such assets, but not including amounts that are shown in those recognised accounts as amounts covered by section 436; and

     * (c) the amount that is shown in the recognised accounts of the company for the statutory accounting period as the amount (if any) by which the gains derived by the company in the statutory accounting period from disposing of commodity futures contracts, commodity forward contracts or rights or options in respect of such contracts exceeds the losses incurred by the company in the statutory accounting period from disposing of commodity futures contracts, commodity forward contracts or rights or options in respect of such contracts, but not including amounts that are shown in those recognised accounts as amounts covered by section 436; and

     * (d) the amount that is shown in the recognised accounts of the company for the statutory accounting period as the amount (if any) by which the sum of the gains derived by the company in the statutory accounting period from currency exchange rate fluctuations exceeds the losses incurred by the company in the statutory accounting period from currency exchange rate fluctuations, but not including amounts that are shown in those recognised accounts as amounts covered by section 436.

    * (1A) In working out the gross turnover of a company of a statutory accounting period, assume that the amounts shown in the company's recognised accounts, as mentioned in paragraphs (1)(b) and (c), for that period had been worked out by also including:

     * (a) as gains derived by the company in that period--capital gains the company would have made; and

     * (b) as losses incurred by the company in that period--capital losses the company would have made;

    * in that period because of CGT event J1, if the assumptions in paragraphs 383(a) to (c) had applied.

        * Note 1: CGT event J1 is about companies ceasing to be related after a rollover.

        * Note 2: Basically, the effect of the assumptions in paragraphs 383(a) to (c) is that the company concerned is taken to be a taxpayer and a resident and CGT event J1 may therefore be taken to have happened.

    * (2) Subject only to sections 437, 438 and 440, for the purposes of this section, where a company has prepared recognised accounts for a statutory accounting period in accordance with commercially accepted accounting principles, then, in determining whether a particular amount shown in those accounts is covered by an expression used in subsection (1) (other than an exclusion of amounts shown in those recognised accounts as amounts covered by section 436), the expression concerned is taken to have the same meaning that it has under those accounting principles.

    * (3) If:

     * (a) arm's length conditions are taken by Subdivision 815B of the _Income Tax Assessment Act 1997 _to operate for purposes relating to the company; and

     * (b) had those conditions operated, an amount described in any of the paragraphs of subsection (1) as being an amount shown in the recognised accounts of the company for the statutory account period would have been different;

    * then the different amount is substituted for the amount shown in the recognised accounts.

##### 435  Gross tainted turnover

    * For the purposes of this Part, the gross tainted turnover of a company of a statutory accounting period is so much of the gross turnover of the company of the statutory accounting period as consists of:

     * (a) passive income of the company of the statutory accounting period; or

     * (b) tainted sales income of the company of the statutory accounting period; or

     * (c) tainted services income of the company of the statutory accounting period.

##### 436  Amounts excluded from active income test

    * (1) For the purposes of the application of this Part to a company, the following amounts are, in accordance with subparagraph 434(1)(a)(i) and paragraphs 434(1)(b), (c) and (d), excluded from the active income test:

     * (a) income or profits derived by the company that are included in the assessable income of the company of any year of income other than under section 143 (where the proviso to that section does not apply);

     * (b) income or profits derived by the company during a statutory accounting period where all of the following conditions are satisfied:

      * (i) the income or profits are derived by the company in carrying on a business at or through a permanent establishment of the company in a listed country (other than a listed country of which the company is a resident);

      * (ii) the income or profits are not eligible designated concession income in relation to any listed country in relation to the statutory accounting period;

      * (iii) the income or profits are subject to tax in a listed country in a tax accounting period:

         * (A) ending before the end of the statutory accounting period; or

         * (B) commencing during the statutory accounting period;

     * (c) an amount that, if the company were a resident within the meaning of section 6, would, or would apart from paragraphs 99B(2)(d) and (e), have been included in the assessable income of the company under Division 6 of Part III;

     * (d) so much of a frankable distribution as is either the franked part of the distribution, or the part of the distribution that has been franked with an exempting credit;

     * (e) a nonportfolio dividend paid to the company by a company that is a resident of a listed country or unlisted country;

     * (g) a premium paid or credited to the company where, because of the application of subsection 148(1), the premium is not allowable as a deduction to the person referred to in subparagraph 148(1)(a)(i) and is not included in the assessable income of the company.

    * (2) Where:

     * (a) the company receives an attribution account payment, being a dividend, from another entity; and

     * (b) the whole or part (in this subsection called the **_eligible amount_**) of the attribution account payment is not excluded from the active income test, in relation to the company in relation to the statutory accounting period, under subsection (1); and

     * (c) on the making of the attribution account payment by the other entity, an attribution debit arises for that entity in relation to a taxpayer;

    * then, for the purposes of this Part, so much of the eligible amount as does not exceed the grossedup amount of the attribution debit is, in accordance with subparagraph 434(1)(a)(i), excluded (in addition to any other amount that is excluded under subsection (1)) from the active income test in relation to the company in relation to the taxpayer.

##### Subdivision C--Treatment of partnership income

##### 437  Treatment of partnership income

    * (1) For each partnership in which a company is a partner at any time during a statutory accounting period, the following modifications apply for the purposes of determining the effect of that partnership on the question whether the company is taken to pass the active income test in relation to the statutory accounting period:

     * (a) the partnership is to be treated as an entity separate from the company;

     * (b) in spite of anything in section 432, the company is not taken to pass the active income test in relation to the statutory accounting period unless:

      * (i) the partnership has kept accounts for the statutory accounting period and:

         * (A) the accounts are prepared in accordance with commercially accepted accounting principles; and

         * (B) the accounts give a true and fair view of the financial position of the partnership; and

      * (ii) the partnership has complied with the substantiation requirements set out in section 452 in relation to the statutory accounting period;

     * (c) for the purposes of this Division, the notional gross tainted turnover of the partnership of the statutory accounting period, or the notional gross turnover of the partnership of the statutory accounting period, is the amount that would be the gross tainted turnover, or the gross turnover, as the case requires, of the partnership of the statutory accounting period if:

      * (i) except for the purposes of determining the associates of the partnership--the partnership were a company; and

      * (ii) a reference in this Division to the recognised accounts of the partnership were a reference to the accounts referred to in paragraph (b) of this subsection that are prepared by the partnership for the statutory accounting period; and

      * (iii) the partnership were a resident of the same particular listed country or particular unlisted country, of which the company was a resident;

     * (d) the gross tainted turnover of the company of the statutory accounting period is to be increased by the amount calculated using the formula: 

     * where: 

     * **_Notional gross tainted turnover of partnership_** means the notional gross tainted turnover of the partnership for the statutory accounting period.

     * **_Partner's interest_** means the company's percentage interest in the profits of the partnership for the statutory accounting period.

     * (e) the gross turnover of the company of the statutory accounting period is to be increased by the amount calculated using the formula: 

     * where: 

     * **_Notional gross turnover of partnership_** means the notional gross turnover of the partnership for the statutory accounting period.

     * **_Partner's interest_** means the company's percentage interest in the profits of the partnership for the statutory accounting period.

    * (2) If:

     * (a) a company is a partner in one or more partnerships at any time during a statutory accounting period; and

     * (b) apart from this subsection, paragraph 432(1)(e) does not apply in relation to the company in relation to the statutory accounting period; and

     * (c) at all times during the statutory accounting period when:

      * (i) a particular one of those partnerships was in existence; and

      * (ii) the company was in existence and was a resident of a particular listed country, or of a particular unlisted country;

     * the partnership carried on business in that country at or through a permanent establishment of the partnership in that country;

    * subsection 432(1) has effect as if paragraph 432(1)(e) had applied in relation to the company in relation to the statutory accounting period.

##### Subdivision D--General interpretive provisions

##### 438  Rollovers--asset disposals

    * (1) This section applies in determining the application of paragraph 434(1)(b) and section 445 in relation to a nontaxable Australian asset of a company.

    * (2) If a CGT rollover provision applies to:

     * (a) the disposal of the asset by an entity (in this section called the **_transferor_**) to the company (in this section called the **_transferee_**); or

     * (b) the disposal of the asset by the company (in this section also called the **_transferor_**) to another entity (in this section also called the **_transferee_**);

      * (ii) the expenditure (if any) incurred by the transferor in making capital improvements to the asset; and

     * (d) the transferor is not taken to have:

      * (i) derived any gains; or

      * (ii) incurred any loss;

     * in respect of the disposal of the asset.

    * (2A) If:

     * (a) a CGT rollover provision applies to the disposal of the asset (in this subsection called the **_original asset_**) by the company; and

     * (b) the disposal is not to another entity; and

     * (c) the company acquires another asset (in this subsection called the **_replacement asset_**) that is referred to in the CGT rollover provision as being by way of replacement of, substitution for, or consideration for the disposal of, the original asset (whether or not exactly those expressions are used);

    * the following provisions have effect: 

     * (d) the company is not taken to have:

      * (i) derived any gains; or

      * (ii) the expenditure (if any) incurred by the company in making improvements to the original asset.

    * (2B) For the purposes of subsections (2) and (2A), if an asset is disposed of by being cancelled, redeemed or consolidated into another asset, the disposal is taken not to be to another entity.

    * (3) For the purposes of this section, in determining whether a CGT rollover provision applies to the disposal of an asset, Parts 31 and 33 of the _Income Tax Assessment Act 1997_ have the effect they would have if:

     * (a) the company had failed the active income test in relation to the statutory accounting period concerned; and

     * (b) those Parts were being applied to calculate the attributable income of the company for the statutory accounting period in relation to any taxpayer.

    * (3A) For the purposes of applying Parts 31 and 33 of the _Income Tax Assessment Act 1997_ in relation to a statutory accounting period as mentioned in paragraph (3)(b), any election or choice that may be made by the company, or by the company and another entity, apart from this section under any of the CGT rollover provisions:

     * (a) on or before the date of lodgment of a particular return of income; or

     * (b) within such period as the Commissioner allows;

    * is to be made instead: 

     * (c) if there is only one attributable taxpayer in relation to the company at the end of the statutory accounting period--on or before the date of lodgment of the taxpayer's return of income of the year of income in which the end of the statutory accounting period occurs; or

     * (d) if there are 2 or more attributable taxpayers in relation to the company at the end of the statutory accounting period:

      * (i) if the taxpayers' returns of income of the year of income in which the end of the statutory accounting period occurs are lodged on different dates--on or before the later or latest of those dates; or

      * (ii) if the taxpayers' returns of income of the year of income in which the end of the statutory accounting period occurs are lodged on the same date--on or before that date; or

     * (e) in any case--within such further period as the Commissioner allows.

    * (3B) For the purposes of applying subsection (3A) to a company in relation to a statutory accounting period, if:

     * (a) the company is a CFC at the end of the statutory accounting period; and

     * (b) an entity (the **_designated entity_**) is the only attributable taxpayer in relation to the company at the end of the statutory accounting period; and

     * (c) the designated entity's attribution percentage in relation to the company i00% at the end of the statutory accounting period;

    * then, instead of the election being given or the choice being made by the company, or by the company and another entity (which other entity may be the designated entity), the election may be given or the choice may be made by:

     * (d) the designated entity; or

     * (e) if the designated entity is not the same as the other entity--the designated entity and the other entity;

    * as the case requires.

    * (4) A reference in this section to a nontaxable Australian asset of a company is a reference to an asset of the company that is a CGT asset that is not taxable Australian property.

##### 439  When currency exchange gains or losses relate to active income transactions

    * (1) For the purposes of this Part, a currency exchange gain, or a currency exchange loss, of a company for a statutory accounting period is to be taken to relate to an active income transaction if, and only if:

     * (a) the gain or loss was realised under any of the following transactions:

      * (i) a transaction that:

    * where: 

    * **_Attribution percent_** means the attributable taxpayer's attribution percentage, at the residencechange time, in relation to the CFC.

    * **_Adjusted distributable profits_** means:

     * (a) if paragraph (1)(c) applies--the amount that would be the CFC's distributable profits at the residencechange time if:

      * (i) ceases to be a resident of an unlisted country; and

      * (ii) becomes a resident of a listed country;

     * at the residencechange time;

    * then, for the purposes of this Act, the tax detriment is taken to be reduced by that amount.

     * (c) the tax detriment would be reduced by an amount if it were recalculated on the following assumptions:

      * (i) sections 97, 98A and 100 applied only to so much of the beneficiary's share of the net income of the Australian trust or the ultimate trust as is attributable to periods when the beneficiary was a Part X Australian resident;

      * (ii) Subdivision 115C of the _Income Tax Assessment Act 1997_ applied only to so much of the beneficiary's share of each capital gain of the Australian trust or the ultimate trust as is attributable to periods when the beneficiary was a Part X Australian resident;

      * (iii) Subdivision 207B of the _Income Tax Assessment Act 1997_ applied only to so much of the beneficiary's share of each franked distribution of the Australian trust or the ultimate trust as is attributable to periods when the beneficiary was a Part X Australian resident;

    * then, for the purposes of this Act, the tax detriment is taken to be reduced by that amount.

    * (4) Where:

     * (a) as a result of the amount being included as mentioned in subsection (1), there is, apart from this subsection, a tax detriment for:

      * (i) the trustee of the Australian trust; or

      * (ii) the trustee of another trust (in this subsection called the **_ultimate trust_**), where the tax detriment occurred because there were one or more partnerships or trusts (but not companies) interposed between the trustee and the Australian partnership or the Australian trust; and

     * (b) the tax detriment would be reduced by an amount if it were recalculated on the assumption that:

      * (i) section 98 applied only to so much of a beneficiary's share of the net income of the Australian trust or the ultimate trust as is attributable to periods when the beneficiary was a Part X Australian resident; and

      * (ii) sections 99 and 99A applied only to the Australian trust or the ultimate trust if it were a resident trust estate within the meaning of Division 6 of Part III;

    * then, for the purposes of this Act, the tax detriment is taken to be reduced by that amount.

##### 460A  Effect of reducing section CGT event J1 amount

    * (1) This section applies in either of the following cases:

     * (a) one or more schemes or arrangements have the effect of reducing the attribution percentage of an attributable taxpayer in relation to a company that is a CFC, and are intended by the attributable taxpayer or an associate of the attributable taxpayer to have that effect;

     * (b) a company ceases to be a CFC in relation to a particular taxpayer.

    * (2) Work out the amount (if any) included under this Division in the taxpayer's assessable income because of CGT event J1 (as it notionally happens to the company under Division 7) as though the reduction or cessation had not happened.

        * Note: CGT event J1 is about companies ceasing to be related after a rollover.

#### Division 10--Postattribution asset disposals

##### 461  Reduction of disposal consideration or capital proceeds if attributed income not distributed

    * (1) If:

     * (a) it is necessary, for the purposes of applying a provision of this Act in the assessment of a taxpayer for a year of income, to take into account:

      * (i) the amount of consideration received, entitled to be received or taken to have been received, by the taxpayer in respect of the disposal of an asset; or

      * (ii) the capital proceeds from a CGT event happening in relation to a CGT asset;

     * being an asset that is an interest in an attribution account entity (the **_disposal entity_**); and

     * (b) immediately before the disposal or CGT event takes place, either or both of the following conditions are satisfied:

      * (i) there is an attribution surplus for the disposal entity in relation to the taxpayer;

      * (ii) there is an attribution surplus for one or more other attribution account entities in relation to the taxpayer, where each such entity is one in which the taxpayer has an indirect attribution account interest held through the disposal entity;

    * then, for the purposes of this Act:

     * (c) the consideration or capital proceeds that, apart from this section, would be taken into account under the provision referred to in paragraph (a) in respect of the disposal or CGT event is, subject to subsection (3), taken to be reduced by so much of the amount of the attribution surplus, or sum of the attribution surpluses, as the case requires; and

     * (d) an attribution debit is taken to arise at the time of the disposal or the CGT event under section 372, in relation to the taxpayer, for each attribution account entity (the **_surplus entity_**) in relation to which there is a surplus to which paragraph (c) applies; and

     * (e) the amount of the attribution debit is equal to so much of the surplus as is taken into account under paragraph (c); and

     * (f) there is no grossedup amount in relation to the attribution debit under section 373.

    * (3) For the purposes of paragraph (1)(c):

     * (a) if the disposal of the asset or the CGT event causes the taxpayer's attribution account percentage for a surplus entity to be reduced by a proportion, then only that proportion of the attribution surplus for the entity is, subject to this subsection, to be taken into account under that paragraph; and

     * (b) if there is only one attribution surplus referred to in that paragraph and (after any application of paragraph (a) of this subsection) it exceeds the consideration from the disposal or the capital proceeds from the CGT event, then only so much of the surplus as does not exceed that consideration or those capital proceeds is to be taken into account under paragraph (1)(c); and

     * (c) where there are 2 or more attribution surpluses referred to in paragraph (1)(c) and (after any application of paragraph (a) of this subsection) their sum exceeds the consideration from the disposal or the capital proceeds from the CGT event, then:

      * (i) if the taxpayer makes an election that, for the purposes of this paragraph, a part of each surplus (after any application of paragraph (a)) such that the sum of the amounts to which the election relates equals that consideration or those capital proceeds--only the part to which the election relates of each surplus is to be taken into account under paragraph (1)(c); or

      * (ii) if subparagraph (i) does not apply--only a proportion of each surplus (after any application of paragraph (a)) is to be taken into account under paragraph (1)(c), being the proportion calculated using the formula:

      * where: 

      * **_consideration _**means the amount of the consideration or the capital proceeds.

      * **_		total surplus_** means the sum of the attribution surpluses (after any application of paragraph (a)).

    * (4) An election for the purposes of paragraph (3)(c) must be made on or before the date of lodgment of the taxpayer's return of income for the year of income referred to in paragraph (1)(a) or within such further period after the lodgment of the return as the Commissioner allows.

    * (4A) In determining, for the purposes of this section, whether there was an attribution surplus immediately before a CGT event, and the amount of such a surplus, also take into account any attribution credit that later arises because the CGT event caused section 104175 of the _Income Tax Assessment Act 1997_ (as it notionally applies to the CGT event entity under Division 7) to operate.

    * (5) In this section:

    * **_interest_**, in relation to an attribution account entity, means:

     * (a) if the entity is a company--an interest in shares in the company, or an entitlement to acquire such an interest; or

     * (b) if the entity is a partnership--an interest of a partner in the profits or property of the partnership, or an entitlement of a partner to acquire such an interest; or

     * (c) if the entity is a trust--an entitlement of a beneficiary to a share of the income or corpus of the trust, or an entitlement of a beneficiary to acquire such an entitlement.
