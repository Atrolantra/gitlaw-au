     * (b) either:

      * (i) the issue of the debenture or debt interest satisfies the public offer test set (see subsection (6)); or

    * this section applies to the interest.

        * Note: Subsection (4) does not apply to the interest because that subsection deals only with interest paid on a debenture or debt interest by the issuing eligible unit trust.

     * (a) the person is an associate of the trustee; and

     * (b) either:

      * (i) the associate is a nonresident and the payment is not received by the associate in respect of a debenture or debt interest that the associate acquired in carrying on a business in Australia at or through a permanent establishment of the associate in Australia; or

      * (ii) the associate is a resident of Australia and the payment is received by the associate in respect of a debenture or debt interest that the associate acquired in carrying on a business in a country outside Australia at or through a permanent establishment of the associate in that country; and

     * (c) the associate does not receive the payment in the capacity of a clearing house, paying agent, custodian, funds manager or responsible entity of a registered scheme.

    * Debentures or debt interests issued through certain nonresident subsidiaries can also get the exemption

    * (5) If:

     * (a) the trustee of an eligible unit trust holds all of the issued equity interests in the capital of a company that is not a resident of Australia; and

     * (b) the company's only business is raising finance for the purposes of the eligible unit trust; and

     * (d) when the debenture or debt interest is issued, the company is treated as a resident of that country for the purposes of the tax law (see subsection (8)) of the country;

    * then this section has effect as if the trustee had raised the finance and issued the debenture or debt interest.

    * Public offer test

    * (6) For the purposes of working out under this section whether the issue of a debenture or debt interest by the trustee of an eligible unit trust **_satisfies the public offer test_**, subsections 128F(3) to (5) apply to the trustee of the eligible unit trust in a corresponding way to the way in which those subsections apply to a company, subject to subsection (7) of this section.

    * (6A) For the purposes of working out under this section whether an invitation to become a lender under a syndicated loan facility satisfies the public offer test, subsections 128F(3A) and (5AA) apply to the trustee of the eligible unit trust in a corresponding way to the way in which those subsections apply to a company, subject to subsection (7) of this section.

    * (7) For the purposes of applying subsection 128F(3), (3A), (4), (5) or (5AA) as mentioned in subsection (6) or (6A) of this section:

     * (a) a reference in any of those subsections to a company knowing, suspecting or having reasonable grounds to suspect something, or it being reasonable for a company to have regarded something, is taken to be a reference to the trustee of the eligible unit trust knowing, suspecting or having reasonable grounds to suspect that thing, or it being reasonable for the trustee of the eligible unit trust to have regarded that thing; and

     * (b) a reference in any of those subsections to an associate is taken to be a reference to an associate within the meaning of this section; and

     * (c) a reference in any of those subsections to a global bond is taken to be a reference to a global bond within the meaning of subsection 128F(10).

     * (a) the Commissioner is satisfied that:

      * (i) the liability to pay the amount of tax arose because the person mistakenly believed, on reasonable grounds, that the other person was a nonresident or an offshore banking unit, that interest payable to the person in respect of the amount transferred would be an outgoing of a particular kind or that the amount transferred was not tax exempt loan money or tax exempt gold; and

      * (ii) the person had taken reasonable steps to ascertain the matter to which the mistaken belief related; or

    * (3) If the sum is a negative amount, a deduction of the amount is allowable in the assessment of the taxpayer of the year of income.

##### 159GQA  Accrual period

     * (a) if it begins less than 6 months after the beginning of the year of income--the period from the beginning of the taxpayer's maximum term until the middle of the year of income is an accrual period and the second 6 months of the year of income is an accrual period; and

     * (b) in any other case--the part of the year of income taken up by the taxpayer's maximum term is an accrual period.

    * End of taxpayer's maximum term

    * (4) If the taxpayer's maximum term ends before the end of a year of income:

     * (a) if it ends no later than 6 months after the beginning of the year of income--the part of the year of income taken up by the taxpayer's maximum term is an accrual period; and

     * (b) in any other case--the first 6 months of the year of income is an accrual period and the period from the middle of the year of income until the end of the taxpayer's maximum term is an accrual period.

    * Example

    * (5) For example, if the taxpayer's year of income is a financial year and a security with a 2 year term is issued to the taxpayer on 1 April, the accrual periods will be as follows: 

##### 159GQB  Accrual amount

    * Formula

    * (3) In the formula in subsection (1), **_Opening balance_** means the amount worked out using the formula: 

    * Issue/transfer price + Previous accruals - Payments

    * **_Issue/transfer price_** means the issue price or transfer price, as the case requires, of the security; and

    * **_Previous accruals_** means:

     * (a) if paragraph (b) does not apply--the sum, whether positive or negative, of all accrual amounts for previous accrual periods in the taxpayer's maximum term; or

     * (b) if the accrual period is the first in the taxpayer's maximum term--nil; and

    * **_Payments_** means all payments (other than of periodic interest) made or liable to be made under the security during all previous accrual periods in the taxpayer's maximum term.

    * Periodic interest etc. 

    * (4) In the formula in subsection (1), **_Periodic interest etc._** means the sum of:

     * (a) all periodic interest payments made or liable to be made under the security during the accrual period, properly adjusted in the case of any payment made other than at the end of the period; and

     * (b) if any payments (other than of periodic interest) made or liable to be made under the security during the accrual period are made or liable to be made other than at its end--an amount to adjust properly for the making of the payments other than at the end of the period.

##### 159GQC  Implicit interest rate for fixed return security

    * For the purposes of the formula component **_Implicit interest rate_** in subsection 159GQB(1), the rate of interest for a fixed return security in relation to a taxpayer is the rate of compound interest per period of 6 months at which:

     * (a) the sum of the present values of all amounts payable under the security during the taxpayer's maximum term;

    * equals: 

     * (b) the issue price or the transfer price, as the case requires, of the security.

##### 159GQD  Implicit interest rate for variable return security

    * Implicit interest rate to be recalculated each year etc.

    * (1) For the purposes of the formula component **_Implicit interest rate_** in subsection 159GQB(1), the rate of interest for a variable return security must be worked out in accordance with subsection (2) separately for each year of income during the taxpayer's maximum term. If there are 2 accrual periods of 6 months in the year of income, the rate is the same for both periods. It is possible for the rate to be negative.

    * Rate

    * (2) The rate applicable in relation to a year of income is the rate of compound interest per period of 6 months in the calculation period (see subsection (3)) at which:

     * (a) the sum of the present values of all amounts payable under the security during the calculation period;

    * equals: 

     * (b) the opening balance, mentioned in subsection 159GQB(1), for the accrual period that begins the calculation period.

    * Calculation period 

    * (3) The **_calculation period_** means the part of the taxpayer's maximum term that occurs after the beginning of the year of income.

    * Where amount payable is not known

    * (4) For the purposes of paragraph (2)(a), if by the end of the year of income it is not possible to determine whether an amount will be payable, or the size of the amount that will be payable, after the end of the year of income, the determination is to be made by applying subsection (5), (7) or (11), or a combination of those subsections.

    * Assumption of constant level

    * (5) Subject to subsection (7), if an amount payable is worked out to any extent by reference to the amount or level, at a particular time, of a rate, price, index or other thing, it is to be assumed that the rate, price, index or thing will be the same at all times after the end of the year of income as it was at the end of the year of income (or, if it was not available at the end of the year of income, at the time when it was last available in the year of income).

    * Examples

    * (6) For the purposes of subsection (5):

     * (a) an example of an amount worked out wholly by reference to the amount of a rate at a particular time is an interest payment under a floating rate note. The amount payable is the product of an interest rate indicator (such as the prevailing bank bill rate) and the face or par value of the note; and

     * (b) an example of an amount worked out wholly by reference to the amount of a price at a particular time is a redemption payment under a commodity linked security where the amount of the payment is the product of the prevailing price of a commodity (such as gold) and the face or par value of the security.

    * Assumption of continuing rate of change

    * (7) If an amount payable is worked out to any extent by reference to the amount of change in an index or other thing that occurs during a period, it is to be assumed that the index or other thing will continue to change at the same rate as it did:

     * (a) if the index or other thing was available at the end of the year of income--during the year of income; or

     * (b) in any other case--during the period of 12 months in respect of which the index or other thing was last available in the year of income.

    * Example

    * (8) An example for the purposes of subsection (7) is a payment whose amount is the product of the face or par value of a security and the percentage increase in the All Groups Consumer Price Index number (the **_CPI_**) during the year ending on 30 June 1995. If the year of income for which the implicit interest rate is being worked out is the 199394 year of income and the CPI increases by 2% during the year ending on 31 March 1994 (the date of the last available number during the year of income), the CPI is assumed to increase by 2% during the year ending on 30 June 1995.

    * Disguised continuing rate of change case

    * (9) For the purposes of subsection (7), if an amount payable is worked out to any extent by reference to the quotient of:

     * (a) the amount or level of an index or other thing at a particular time; and

     * (b) either:

      * (i) the amount or level of the index or other thing at a different time; or

      * (ii) another amount that, while not expressed to be the amount or level of the index or other thing at a different time, may reasonably be regarded as representing the amount or level of the index or other thing at a different time;

    * the amount payable is taken to be worked out to that extent by reference to the amount of change in the index or other thing that occurs during the period between the 2 times.

    * Example

    * (10) An example for the purposes of subsection (9) is a payment under a security issued in December 1994 that is worked out by multiplying a number of dollars by the quotient of:

     * (a) the All Groups Consumer Price Index number in respect of the quarter ending on 31 December 1997; and

     * (b) the number 114.

    * Assume that the number in paragraph (b) is the same as the All Groups Consumer Price Index number in respect of the quarter ending on 31 December 1994. In this case, it would be reasonable to regard the number as representing the amount of the index at 31 December 1994, and therefore to apply subsection (7).

    * General assumption

    * (11) If it is not possible to make the determination mentioned in subsection (4) in respect of the whole or part of any amount by applying subsection (5) or (7), or both, (for example, because no information about a rate, price or index was available during the year of income), the determination in respect of that whole or part is to be made on the basis of what is most likely in the circumstances.

##### 159GR  Consequences of actual payments

    * (1) Where a payment (not being a payment that is, or to the extent that it consists of, a periodic interest payment, a redemption payment or a partial redemption payment) is made or liable to be made in a year of income to a taxpayer under a qualifying security:

     * (a) no amount shall be included in the assessable income of the taxpayer of the year of income in respect of the payment otherwise than under section 159GQ; and

     * (b) where the taxpayer acquired the qualifying security on transfer--no amount shall be allowable as a deduction from the assessable income of the taxpayer of the year of income in respect of the payment otherwise than under section 159GQ.

##### 159GS  Balancing adjustments on transfer of qualifying security

    * (1) Where there is a profit amount in relation to the transfer of a qualifying security by a taxpayer in a year of income:

     * (a) if there is a net assessable amount in relation to the transfer and:

      * (i) the profit amount exceeds the net assessable amount--an amount equal to the excess shall be included in the assessable income of the taxpayer of the year of income; or

      * (ii) the net assessable amount exceeds the profit amount--an amount equal to the excess shall be allowable as a deduction from the assessable income of the taxpayer of the year of income; and

     * (b) if there is a net deductible amount in relation to the transfer--an amount equal to the sum of that amount and the profit amount shall be included in the assessable income of the taxpayer of the year of income.

    * (2) Where there is a loss amount in relation to the transfer of a qualifying security by a taxpayer in a year of income and:

     * (a) there is a net assessable amount in relation to the transfer--an amount equal to the net assessable amount shall be allowable as a deduction from the assessable income of the taxpayer of the year of income; or

     * (b) there is a net deductible amount in relation to the transfer that exceeds the loss amount--an amount equal to the excess shall be included in the assessable income of the taxpayer of the year of income.

    * (3) For the purposes of the application of this section in relation to the transfer (in this subsection referred to as the **_relevant transfer_**) of a qualifying security by a taxpayer:

     * (a) where the transfer price, as increased by the amount of any payments (other than periodic interest payments) made to the taxpayer under the security in respect of the period when the security was held by the taxpayer exceeds:

      * (i) the issue price of the security; or

      * (ii) where the security was acquired by the taxpayer on transfer--the transfer price in relation to that transfer;

     * there shall be taken to be a profit amount in relation to the relevant transfer of an amount equal to the excess;

     * (b) where the issue price of the security or, where the security was acquired by the taxpayer on transfer, the transfer price in relation to that transfer exceeds the sum of the transfer price in relation to the relevant transfer and any payments (other than periodic interest payments) made to the taxpayer under the security in respect of the period when the security was held by the taxpayer, there shall be taken to be a loss amount in relation to the relevant transfer of an amount equal to the excess;

     * (c) where the sum of all amounts (if any) included under section 159GQ in the assessable income of the taxpayer in respect of the security in respect of the period when the security was held by the taxpayer exceeds the sum of all amounts (if any) allowable under those sections as deductions from the assessable income of the taxpayer in respect of the security in respect of that period, there shall be taken to be a net assessable amount in relation to the relevant transfer of an amount equal to the excess; and

     * (d) where the sum of all amounts (if any) allowable under section 159GQ as deductions from the assessable income of the taxpayer in respect of the security in respect of the period when the taxpayer held the security exceeds the sum of all amounts (if any) included under those sections in the assessable income of the taxpayer in respect of the security in respect of that period, there shall be taken to be a net deductible amount in relation to the relevant transfer of an amount equal to the excess.

##### 159GT  Tax treatment of issuer of a qualifying security

    * (1) Subsections (1A) and (1B) apply if a taxpayer is an issuer of a qualifying security to which this section applies during a period (the **_issuer period_**) comprising the whole or part of a year of income.

    * (1A) If, on the assumptions in subsection (1C), an amount would be included in the taxpayer's assessable income of the year of income in respect of the issuer period, then, subject to this section, the taxpayer is entitled to a deduction in his or her assessment for the year of income equal to that amount.

    * (1B) If, on the assumptions in subsection (1C), a deduction would be allowable in the taxpayer's assessment for the year of income, then an amount equal to the deduction is included in the taxpayer's assessable income of the year of income.

    * (1C) For the purposes of subsections (1A) and (1B), the assumptions are that:

     * (a) the security was issued to the taxpayer (rather than the taxpayer being the issuer of the security); and

     * (b) the taxpayer held the security during the whole of the issuer period; and

     * (c) the taxpayer did not transfer the security at the end of the issuer period; and

     * (d) sections 159GW, 159GX and 159GY were not enacted.

    * (2) A deduction is not allowable to a taxpayer under subsection (1A) in relation to a qualifying security to which this section applies unless the taxpayer would, but for this Division, be entitled to a deduction under section 81 of the _Income Tax Assessment Act 1997_ in respect of payments (not being redemption payments, partial redemption payments or periodic interest payments) made or liable to be made under the security in respect of the relevant period referred to in that subsection.

    * (3) Where a payment (not being a payment that is, or to the extent that it consists of, a periodic interest payment, a redemption payment or a partial redemption payment) is made or liable to be made in a year of income by a taxpayer under a qualifying security to which this section applies, no amount shall be allowable as a deduction from the assessable income of the taxpayer of the year of income in respect of the payment otherwise than under this section.

    * (5) Subject to subsection (6), this section applies to:

     * (a) any qualifying security issued on or before 22 May 1986; and

     * (b) any qualifying security issued in  after 22 May 1986 other than a negotiable instrument issued payable to bearer.

    * (6) This section does not apply to a qualifying security issued by a taxpayer after  in the evening, by standard time in the , on 23 April 1987:

     * (a) to, on behalf of or otherwise for the benefit of, a nonresident or a prescribed dual resident associate of the taxpayer; or

     * (b) subject to an agreement between the taxpayer and an associate of the taxpayer under which the security is or was to be transferred to a nonresident or a prescribed dual resident associate of the taxpayer.

##### 159GU  Effect of Division on certain transfer profits and losses

    * (1) Where, apart from this Division, a profit that is made by a resident taxpayer in relation to a transfer of a qualifying security that does not form part of the trading stock of the taxpayer would be included in the assessable income of the taxpayer of a year of income, the profit shall not be so included in the assessable income of the taxpayer.

    * (2) Where, apart from this Division, a loss that is incurred by a resident taxpayer in relation to a transfer of a qualifying security that does not form part of the trading stock of the taxpayer would be allowable as a deduction from the assessable income of the taxpayer of a year of income and there is a net deductible amount, within the meaning of section 159GS, in relation to the transfer, so much only of the amount of the loss as exceeds the net deductible amount shall be so allowable as a deduction.

##### 159GV  Consequence of variation of terms of security

    * (1) Where, after 22 May 1986, a material variation is made in the terms of a security, for the purposes of the application of this Division in relation to the security in respect of the period after the variation and before any subsequent material variation:

     * (a) the security shall be taken to have been issued on the terms on which it was originally issued as varied by the material variation and any prior variation;

     * (b) where consideration for the variation is paid or payable by the holder of the security--the issue price of the security shall be taken to be an amount equal to the amount that was the issue price of the security immediately before this application of this subsection increased by the amount of that consideration;

     * (c) where consideration for the variation is paid or payable by the issuer of the security--the issue price of the security shall be taken to be an amount equal to the amount that was the issue price of the security immediately before this application of this subsection reduced by the amount of that consideration; and

     * (d) paragraph (a) of the definition of **_qualifying security_** in subsection 159GP(1) shall be disregarded.

    * (2) Where:

     * (a) subsection (1) applies in relation to a security held by a taxpayer in relation to a material variation in the terms of the security; and

     * (b) if:

      * (i) that subsection had effect not only in relation to the period after the variation but also in relation to the whole of the term of the security before the variation; and

      * (ii) any previous material variations were taken into account but any subsequent material variations were disregarded;

     * the sum (in this subsection referred to as the **_ total notional taxable income_**) of the taxable incomes of the taxpayer in respect of the year of income in which the variation is made and all previous years of income would have differed from the sum (in this subsection referred to as the  **_total actual taxable income_**) of the actual taxable incomes of the taxpayer of those years of income;

    * the following provisions have effect: 

     * (c) where the total notional taxable income exceeds the total actual taxable income--an amount equal to the excess shall be included in the assessable income of the taxpayer of the year of income in which the variation is made;

     * (d) where the total actual taxable income exceeds the total notional taxable income--an amount equal to the excess shall be allowable as a deduction from the assessable income of the taxpayer of the year of income in which the variation is made.

    * (3) In this section, a reference to a material variation of the terms of a security is a reference to a variation of the terms of the security:

     * (a) that has the effect that a security that was not a qualifying security before the variation would, if the security had been originally issued with the terms as varied and if paragraph (a) of the definition of **_qualifying security_** in subsection 159GP(1) were disregarded, have been a qualifying security when the security was issued;

     * (b) that has the effect that a security that is a qualifying security would, if originally issued with the terms as varied, not have been a qualifying security at the time of issue; or

     * (c) that has the effect that the amount, or time of making, of a payment under the security, or that the holder or issuer of the security, is varied.

    * (4) Where any right or option under a security to extend the term of, or otherwise vary the effect of, the security is exercised, then, for the purposes of this section, the exercise of that right or option shall be taken to be a variation of the terms of the security to provide for the extension or other effect.

##### 159GW  Effect of Division in relation to nonresidents

    * (1) Subject to subsection (2), where during the whole or a part of a year of income (which whole or part is in this subsection referred to as the **_period of nonresidence_**) a taxpayer is not a resident:

     * (a) no amount shall be included in, or allowable as a deduction from, the assessable income of the taxpayer of the year of income under section 159GQ in relation to the period of nonresidence; and

     * (c) no amount shall be included in, or allowable as a deduction from, the assessable income of the taxpayer of the year of income under section 159GS in relation to any transfer of the security that occurred during the period of nonresidence.

    * (2) Where:

     * (a) a payment is made or liable to be made under a qualifying security to a resident taxpayer; and

     * (b) the taxpayer was not a resident for the whole or a part (which whole or part is in this subsection referred to as the **_period of nonresidence_**) of the period during which the taxpayer held the security;

    * the following provisions have effect: 

     * (c) there shall be included in the assessable income of the taxpayer of the year of income in which the payment is made or liable to be made an amount equal to the amount that, but for subsection (1), would have been included in the assessable income of the taxpayer of any year or years of income under section 159GQ in respect of the payment in respect of the period of nonresidence;

     * (d) there shall be allowable as a deduction from the assessable income of the taxpayer of the year of income in which the payment is made or liable to be made an amount equal to the amount that, but for subsection (1), would have been allowable as a deduction from the assessable income of the taxpayer of any year or years of income under section 159GQ in respect of the payment in respect of the period of nonresidence.

##### 159GX  Effect of Division where certain payments not assessable

    * Where, but for this section, an amount would be included in, or allowable as a deduction from, the assessable income of a taxpayer of a year of income under section 159GQ in respect of the whole or a part of a payment under a qualifying security, no amount shall be so included or allowable unless the payment or a part of the payment, when actually made or liable to be made, would, disregarding section 128D, be included in the assessable income of the taxpayer of a year of income.

##### 159GY  Effect of Division where qualifying security is trading stock

    * No amount shall be included in, or allowable as a deduction from, the assessable income of a taxpayer:

     * (a) under section 159GQ in relation to a qualifying security in respect of any year or part of a year of income during which the qualifying security forms part of the trading stock of the taxpayer; or

     * (c) under section 159GS in relation to the transfer of a qualifying security by the taxpayer where, immediately before the transfer, the qualifying security was or formed part of the trading stock of the taxpayer.

##### 159GZ  Stripped securities

    * (1) Where:

     * (a) at any time a taxpayer acquires or acquired a security (in this subsection referred to as the **_underlying security_**) in relation to which there are or were 2 or more payment rights; and

     * (b) the taxpayer transfers or transferred one or some but not all of those rights to a particular person or particular persons jointly;

    * for the purposes of the application of this Division (including any subsequent application of this subsection) in relation to any period after the transfer of the right or rights:

     * (c) instead of the underlying security, there shall be taken to have been originally issued:

      * (i) a separate security under which the payment right or payment rights transferred to the person or persons referred to in paragraph (b) were created;

      * (ii) where at the time at which that right or those rights were transferred, another payment right or other payment rights in relation to the underlying security was or were transferred to another person or to other persons jointly--a separate security under which that other right or those other rights were created; and

      * (iii) where immediately after the transfer the taxpayer retains or retained any payment right or rights--a separate security under which that right or those rights were created;

     * (d) where the underlying security was issued to the taxpayer--the issue price of each separate security referred to in paragraph (c) shall be taken to be so much of the issue price of the underlying security as bears to that amount the proportion that the market value of the separate security at the time of issue of the underlying security bears to the market value of the underlying security at that time; and

     * (e) where the underlying security was acquired by the taxpayer on transfer--the transfer price, in relation to that transfer, of each separate security referred to in paragraph (c) shall be taken to be so much of the transfer price of the underlying security as bears to that amount the proportion that the market value of the separate security at the time of transfer bears to the market value of the underlying security at that time.

    * (2) Where, by reason of the application of subsection (1) in relation to the transfer after 16 December 1984 of a payment right or payment rights in relation to a security to a particular person or particular persons jointly, the payment right or rights is or are taken to comprise a separate security, then, for the purposes of the application of this Division in relation to the separate security in relation to any period after the transfer, paragraph (a) of the definition of **_qualifying security_** in subsection 159GP(1) shall be disregarded.

    * (3) In subsections (1) and (2), **_payment right_**, in relation to a security, means a right to receive a particular payment that is liable to be made under the security.

    * (4) Where:

     * (a) at any time a taxpayer acquires or acquired a security (in this subsection referred to as the **_underlying security_**) on issue or transfer;

     * (b) after 16 December 1984, the taxpayer issues a qualifying security (in this subsection referred to as the **_stripped security_**); and

     * (c) but for this subsection, a deduction of an amount equal to the whole or a part of the issue price or, where the underlying security was acquired on transfer, the transfer price of the underlying security would be allowable from the assessable income of the taxpayer of the year of income in which the taxpayer issues the stripped security in respect of the issue of the stripped security;

    * the amount of the deduction allowable shall be an amount that bears to the issue price or transfer price, as the case may be, of the underlying security the same proportion as the market value of the stripped security at the time of issue or purchase, as the case may be, bears to the market value of the underlying security at that time.

##### 159GZZZQ  Consideration in respect of offmarket purchase

    * (1) Subject to this section, if a buyback of a share is an offmarket purchase, then:

     * (a) in determining, for the purposes of this Act:

      * (i) whether an amount is included in the assessable income of the seller under a provision of this Act other than Parts 31 and 33 of the _Income Tax Assessment Act 1997_ (about CGT); or

      * (ii) whether an amount is allowable as a deduction to the seller; or

    * in respect of the buyback, the seller is taken to have received or to be entitled to receive, as consideration in respect of the sale of the share, an amount equal to the purchase price in respect of the buyback.

    * Deemed consideration increased to market value

    * (2) If apart from this section:

     * (a) the purchase price in respect of the buyback;

    * is less than: 

     * (b) the amount that would have been the market value of the share at the time of the buyback if the buyback did not occur and was never proposed to occur;

    * then, subject to subsection (3), in making the determinations mentioned in paragraphs (1)(a) and (b), the amount of consideration that the seller is taken to have received or to be entitled to receive in respect of the sale of the share is equal to the market value mentioned in paragraph (b) of this subsection.

    * Deemed consideration reduced where dividend assessable etc.

    * (3) Subject to subsection (8), if there is a reduction amount in respect of the buyback (see subsection (4)), then, in making the determinations mentioned in paragraphs (1)(a) and (b), the amount of consideration that the seller is taken to have received or to be entitled to receive in respect of the sale of the share, after any application of subsection (2), is reduced by the reduction amount.

    * Reduction amount

    * (4) The following steps are to be taken in working out whether there is a reduction amount in respect of the buyback:

     * (a) first, work out whether the whole or part of the purchase price in respect of the buyback is taken to be a dividend by section 159GZZZP;

     * (b) second, for any amount satisfying paragraph (a), work out whether the whole or part of it is either:

      * (i) included in the seller's assessable income of any year of income (disregarding section 128D of this Act and section 80215 of the _Income Tax Assessment Act 1997_); or

      * (ii) an eligible noncapital amount (see subsection (5)).

    * The amount worked out is the **_reduction amount _**in respect of the buyback.

    * Eligible noncapital amount

    * (5) An amount is an **_eligible noncapital amount _**if it is neither:

     * (a) debited against a share capital account or a reserve to the extent that it consists of profits from the revaluation of assets of the company that have not been disposed of by the company; nor

     * (b) attributable, either directly or indirectly, to amounts that were transferred from such an account or reserve of the company.

    * Debit for deemed dividend

    * (7) For the purposes of subsection (5), an amount of the purchase price that is taken to be a dividend by section 159GZZZP is taken to have been debited against the account or reserves against which the purchase price was debited, and to the same extent.

    * Offsetable amount excluded from reduction where loss

    * (8) If:

     * (aa) the seller is a corporate tax entity; and

     * (a) the amount of consideration that the seller is taken by subsection (1) or (2) to have received or to be entitled to receive in respect of the sale of the share is, apart from this subsection, reduced by a reduction amount under subsection (3); and

     * (b) the dividend mentioned in paragraph (4)(a), so far as it does not exceed the reduction amount, consists to any extent of an offsetable amount (see subsection (9)); and

     * (c) disregarding this subsection, as a result of the operation of this section:

      * (i) for the purposes of Parts 31 and 33 of the _Income Tax Assessment Act 1997_ (about CGT), the seller incurs a capital loss or an increased capital loss (which loss or increase is the **_loss amount_**) in respect of the buyback; or

      * (ii) a loss, or an increased loss, (which loss or increase is also the **_loss amount_**) in respect of the buyback is allowable as a deduction to the seller under a provision of a Part of this Act other than Part 31 or 33 of the _Income Tax Assessment Act 1997_; or

      * (iii) the amount of a deduction allowable from the seller's assessable income of any year of income in respect of the issue or acquisition of the share exceeds, or exceeds by a greater amount, (the excess or increased excess is also the **_loss amount_**) the amount included in the seller's assessable income of any year of income in respect of the buyback of the share;

    * then the reduction in the amount of the consideration under subsection (3) is instead a reduction equal to:

     * (d) the reduction amount;

    * less: 

     * (e) so much of the offsetable amount as does not exceed the loss amount.

    * Meaning of offsetable amount

    * (9) For the purposes of subsection (8), if the seller is entitled to a tax offset under Division 207 of the _Income Tax Assessment Act 1997 _in the seller's assessment for a year of income in respect of the dividend, the dividend consists of an **_offsetable amount _**worked out using the formula:

##### Subdivision D--Onmarket purchases

##### 159GZZZR  No part of onmarket purchase price is a dividend

    * For the purposes of this Act, where a buyback by a company of a share is an onmarket purchase, no part of the purchase price in respect of the buyback of the share is taken to be a dividend.

##### 159GZZZS  Consideration in respect of onmarket purchase

    * Where a buyback is an onmarket purchase, then:

     * (a) in determining, for the purposes of this Act:

      * (i) whether an amount is included in the assessable income of the seller under a provision of this Act other than Parts 31 and 33 of the _Income Tax Assessment Act 1997_ (about CGT); or

      * (ii) whether an amount is allowable as a deduction to the seller; or

     * (b) whether the seller makes a capital gain or capital loss;

    * in respect of the buyback, the seller is taken to have received or to be entitled to receive, as consideration in respect of the sale of the share, the purchase price in respect of the buyback of the share.

    * (3) A decision that a tax effect might reasonably be expected to have occurred if the scheme had not been entered into or carried out must be based on a postulate that is a reasonable alternative to entering into or carrying out the scheme.
