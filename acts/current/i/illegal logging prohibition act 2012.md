         * Note: For continuing contraventions of civil penalty provisions, see section 72.

     * (1) Proceedings for a civil penalty order against a person for a contravention of a civil penalty provision are stayed if:

##### 69  Criminal proceedings after civil proceedings

##### 70  Evidence given in civil proceedings not admissible in criminal proceedings

     * (1) Evidence of information given, or evidence of production of documents by an individual, is not admissible in criminal proceedings against the individual if:

      * (b) the conduct alleged to constitute the offence is the same, or substantially the same, as the conduct alleged to constitute the contravention.

     * (2) However, subsection (1) does not apply to criminal proceedings in relation to the falsity of the evidence given by the individual in the proceedings for the civil penalty order.

      * (a) within a particular period; or

     * then the obligation to do that act or thing continues until the act or thing is done (even if the period has expired or the time has passed).

     * (2) A person who contravenes a civil penalty provision that requires an act or thing to be done:

      * (a) within a particular period; or

      * (b) before a particular time;

     * commits a separate contravention of that provision in respect of each day during which the contravention occurs (including the day the relevant civil penalty order is made or any later day).

##### 73  Mistake of fact

     * (1) A person is not liable to have a civil penalty order made against the person for a contravention of a civil penalty provision if:

      * (a) at or before the time of the conduct constituting the contravention, the person:

       * (i) considered whether or not facts existed; and

       * (ii) was under a mistaken but reasonable belief about those facts; and

      * (b) had those facts existed, the conduct would not have constituted a contravention of the civil penalty provision.

     * (2) For the purposes of subsection (1), a person may be regarded as having considered whether or not facts existed if:

      * (a) the person had considered, on a previous occasion, whether those facts existed in the circumstances surrounding that occasion; and

      * (b) the person honestly and reasonably believed that the circumstances surrounding the present occasion were the same, or substantially the same, as those surrounding the previous occasion.

#### Division 6--Infringement notices

##### 75  Simplified outline

     * The following is a simplified outline of this Division: 

     * This Division deals with the use of infringement notices in the enforcement of provisions.

     * A person can be given an infringement notice in relation to a contravention of this Act.

     * A person who is given an infringement notice can choose to pay an amount as an alternative to having court proceedings brought against the person for a contravention of this Act. If the person does not choose to pay the amount, proceedings can be brought against the person in relation to the contravention.

##### 76  When an infringement notice may be given

     * (1) If an inspector has reasonable grounds to believe that a person has contravened this Act, the inspector may give to the person an infringement notice for the alleged contravention.

     * (2) The infringement notice must be given within 12 months after the day on which the contravention is alleged to have taken place.

     * (3) A single infringement notice must relate only to a single contravention of a provision unless subsection (4) applies.

     * (4) An inspector may give a person a single infringement notice relating to multiple contraventions of a single provision if:

      * (a) the provision requires the person to do a thing within a particular period or before a particular time; and

      * (b) the person fails or refuses to do that thing within that period or before that time; and

      * (c) the failure or refusal occurs on more than one day; and

      * (d) each contravention is constituted by the failure or refusal on one of those days.

         * Note: For continuing offences, see subsection 4K(2) of the _Crimes Act 1914_. For continuing contraventions of civil penalty provisions, see section 72 of this Act.

     * (5) If a single provision can constitute both a civil penalty provision and an offence provision, the infringement notice must relate to the provision as an offence provision.

##### 77  Matters to be included in an infringement notice

     * (1) An infringement notice must:

      * (a) be identified by a unique number; and

      * (b) state the day on which it is given; and

      * (h) state that, if the person to whom the notice is given pays the amount within 28 days after the day the notice is given, then (unless the notice is withdrawn):

       * (i) if the provision is an offence provision and does not also constitute a civil penalty provision--the person will not be liable to be prosecuted in a court for the alleged contravention; or

       * (ii) if the provision is an offence provision that can also constitute a civil penalty provision--the person is not liable to be prosecuted in a court, and proceedings seeking a civil penalty order will not be brought, in relation to the alleged contravention; or

       * (iii) if the provision is a civil penalty provision--proceedings seeking a civil penalty order will not be brought in relation to the alleged contravention; and

      * (i) state that payment of the amount is not an admission of guilt or liability; and

      * (j) state that the person may apply to the Secretary to have the period in which to pay the amount extended; and

      * (k) state that the person may choose not to pay the amount and, if the person does so:
