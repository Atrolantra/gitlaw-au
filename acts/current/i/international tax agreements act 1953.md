5.	A person acting in a territory on behalf of an enterprise of the other territory--other than an agent of an independent status to whom paragraph 6 applies--shall be deemed to be a permanent establishment of that enterprise in the firstmentioned territory if:

    * (a) the person has, and habitually exercises in that territory, an authority to conclude contracts on behalf of the enterprise, unless the person's activities are limited to the purchase of goods or merchandise for the enterprise; or

    * (b) in so acting, the person manufactures or processes in that territory for the enterprise goods or merchandise belonging to the enterprise.

6.	An enterprise of a territory shall not be deemed to have a permanent establishment in the other territory merely because it carries on business in that other territory through a person who is a broker, general commission agent or any other agent of an independent status and is acting in the ordinary course of the person's business as such a broker or agent.

7.	The fact that a company which is a resident of a territory controls or is controlled by a company which is a resident of the other territory, or which carries on business in that other territory (whether through a permanent establishment or otherwise), shall not of itself make either company a permanent establishment of the other.

8.	The principles set forth in the preceding paragraphs of this Article shall be applied in determining for the purposes of paragraph 5 of Article 11 and paragraph 5 of Article 12 whether an enterprise, not being an enterprise of either territory, has a permanent establishment in a territory.

Article 6

Income from real property

1.	Income from real property may be taxed in the territory in which the real property is situated.

2.	In this Article, the term "real property":

    * (a) in the case of the territory in which the taxation law administered by the Australian Taxation Office is applied, has the meaning it has under the law of that territory, and includes:

       * (i) a lease of land and any other interest in or over land, whether improved or not; and

       * (ii) a right to receive variable or fixed payments as consideration for the exploitation of or the right to explore for or exploit, or in respect of the proceeds from the exploitation of, mineral deposits, oil or gas wells, quarries or other places of extraction or exploitation of natural resources; and

    * (c) shall not include ships, boats and aircraft.

3.	Any interest or right referred to in paragraph 2 shall be regarded as situated where the land, mineral, oil or gas deposits, quarries or natural resources, as the case may be, are situated or where the exploration may take place.

4.	The provisions of paragraph 1 shall apply to income derived from the direct use, letting, or use in any other form of real property.

5.	The provisions of paragraphs 1 and 4 shall also apply to income from real property of an enterprise and to income from real property used for the performance of independent personal services.

Article 7

Business profits

1.	The profits of an enterprise of a territory shall be taxable only in that territory unless the enterprise carries on business in the other territory through a permanent establishment situated in that other territory. If the enterprise carries on business in that manner, the profits of the enterprise may be taxed in the other territory but only so much of them as is attributable to that permanent establishment.

2.	Subject to the provisions of paragraph 3, where an enterprise of a territory carries on business in the other territory through a permanent establishment situated in that other territory, there shall be attributed to that permanent establishment in each territory the profits which that permanent establishment might be expected to make if it were a distinct and separate enterprise engaged in the same or similar activities under the same or similar conditions and dealing wholly independently with the enterprise of which it is a permanent establishment or with other enterprises with which it deals.

3.	In determining the profits of a permanent establishment, there shall be allowed as deductions expenses which are incurred for the purposes of the permanent establishment (including executive and general administrative expenses so incurred) and which would be deductible if the permanent establishment were an independent entity which paid those expenses, whether incurred in the territory in which the permanent establishment is situated or elsewhere.

4.	No profits shall be attributed to a permanent establishment by reason of the mere purchase by that permanent establishment of goods or merchandise for the enterprise.

5.	Nothing in this Article shall affect the application of any law of a territory relating to the determination of the tax liability of a person, including determinations in cases where the information available to the competent authority of that territory is inadequate to determine the profits to be attributed to a permanent establishment, provided that that law shall be applied, so far as it is practicable to do so, consistently with the principles of this Article.

6.	Where profits include items of income or gains which are dealt with separately in other Articles of this Agreement, then the provisions of those Articles shall not be affected by the provisions of this Article.

7.	Nothing in this Article shall affect the operation of any law of a territory relating to tax imposed on profits from insurance with nonresidents provided that if the relevant law in force in either territory at the date of signature of this Agreement is varied (otherwise than in minor respects so as not to affect its general character) the parties to this Agreement shall consult each other with a view to facilitating any amendment of this paragraph as may be appropriate.

8.	Where:

    * (a) a resident of a territory is beneficially entitled, whether directly or through one or more interposed trust estates, to a share of the business profits of an enterprise carried on in the other territory by the trustee of a trust estate other than a trust estate which is treated as a company for tax purposes; and

    * (b) in relation to that enterprise, that trustee would, in accordance with the principles of Article 5, have a permanent establishment in that other territory,

the enterprise carried on by the trustee shall be deemed to be a business carried on in the other territory by that resident through a permanent establishment situated in that other territory and that share of business profits shall be attributed to that permanent establishment.

Article 8

Ships and aircraft

1.	Profits derived by an enterprise of a territory from the operation of ships or aircraft shall be taxable only in that territory.

2.	Notwithstanding the provisions of paragraph 1, such profits shall be taxed in the other territory to the extent that they are profits derived directly or indirectly from ship or aircraft operations confined solely to places in that other territory.

3.	The profits to which the provisions of paragraphs 1 and 2 apply shall include profits from:

    * (a) the lease of ships or aircraft on a full time, voyage or bareboat basis, and of containers and related equipment, which is merely incidental to the international operation of ships or aircraft by the lessor, provided that the leased ships or aircraft, or the containers and related equipment, are used in international operations by the lessee; and

    * (b) the operation of ships or aircraft derived through participation in a pool, a joint business or an international operating agency.

4.	For the purposes of this Article, profits derived from the carriage by ships or aircraft of passengers, livestock, mail, goods or merchandise which are shipped in a territory and discharged at a place in that territory shall be treated as profits from ship or aircraft operations confined solely to places in that territory.

Article 9

Associated enterprises

1.	Where

    * (a) an enterprise of a territory participates directly or indirectly in the management, control or capital of an enterprise of the other territory; or

    * (b) the same persons participate directly or indirectly in the management, control or capital of an enterprise of a territory and an enterprise of the other territory,

and in either case conditions operate between the two enterprises in their commercial or financial relations which differ from those which might be expected to operate between independent enterprises dealing wholly independently with one another, then any profits which, but for those conditions, might have been expected to accrue to one of the enterprises, but, by reason of those conditions, have not so accrued, may be included in the profits of that enterprise and taxed accordingly.

2.	Nothing in this Article shall affect the application of any law of a territory relating to the determination of the tax liability of a person, including determinations in cases where the information available to the competent authority of that territory is inadequate to determine the profits to be attributed to an enterprise, provided that that law shall be applied, so far as it is practicable to do so, consistently with the principles of this Article.

3.	Where profits on which an enterprise of a territory has been charged to tax in that territory are also included, by virtue of the provisions of paragraph 1 or 2, in the profits of an enterprise of the other territory and charged to tax in that other territory, and the profits so included are profits which might have been expected to have accrued to that enterprise of the other territory if the conditions operative between the enterprises had been those which might have been expected to have operated between independent enterprises dealing wholly independently with one another, then the firstmentioned territory shall make an appropriate adjustment to the amount of tax charged on those profits in the firstmentioned territory. In determining such an adjustment, due regard shall be had to the other provisions of this Agreement and for this purpose the competent authorities shall if necessary consult each other.

Article 10

Dividends

1.	Dividends paid by a company which is a resident of a territory for the purposes of its tax, being dividends to which a resident of the other territory is beneficially entitled, may be taxed in that other territory.

2.	However, those dividends may also be taxed in the territory of which the company paying the dividends is a resident for the purposes of its tax, and according to the law of that territory, but the tax so charged shall not exceed:

    * (a) in the territory in which the taxation law administered by the Australian Taxation Office is applied:

      * (i) 10 per cent of the gross amount of the dividends, to the extent to which the dividends have been fully "franked" in accordance with the federal law of that territory relating to its income tax; and

      * (ii) 15 per cent of the gross amount of the dividends in all other cases; and

    * (b) in the territory in which the taxation law administered by the Department of Taxation, Ministry of Finance,  is applied:

      * (i) 10 per cent of the gross amount of the dividends, where the dividends are paid to a company (other than a partnership) which holds directly at least 25 per cent of the capital of the company paying the dividends; and

      * (ii) 15 per cent of the gross amount of the dividends in all other cases,

provided that if the relevant law in either territory at the date of signature of this Agreement is varied, otherwise than in minor respects so as to not affect its general character, the parties to this Agreement shall consult each other with a view to facilitating any amendment of this paragraph as may be appropriate.

3.	The term "dividends" in this Article means income from shares and other income assimilated to income from shares by the law, relating to tax, of the territory of which the company making the distribution is a resident for the purposes of its tax.

4.	The provisions of paragraphs 1 and 2 shall not apply if the person beneficially entitled to the dividends, being a resident of a territory, carries on business in the other territory of which the company paying the dividends is a resident, through a permanent establishment situated in that other territory, or performs in that other territory independent personal services from a fixed base situated in that other territory, and the holding in respect of which the dividends are paid is effectively connected with that permanent establishment or fixed base. In that case the provisions of Article 7 or Article 14, as the case may be, shall apply.

5.	Dividends paid by a company which is a resident of a territory, being dividends to which a person who is not a resident of the other territory is beneficially entitled, shall be exempt from tax in that other territory except insofar as the holding in respect of which the dividends are paid is effectively connected with a permanent establishment or a fixed base situated in that other territory. This paragraph shall not apply in relation to dividends paid by any company which is a resident of the territory in which the taxation law administered by the Australian Taxation Office is applied for the purposes of tax imposed by that territory and which is also a resident of the territory in which the taxation law administered by the Department of Taxation, Ministry of Finance, Taipei is applied for the purposes of tax imposed by that territory.

Article 11

Interest

1.	Interest arising in a territory, being interest to which a resident of the other territory is beneficially entitled, may be taxed in that other territory.

2.	However, that interest may also be taxed in the territory in which it arises, and according to the law of that territory, but the tax so charged shall not exceed 10 per cent of the gross amount of the interest.

3.	The term "interest" in this Article includes interest from government securities or from bonds or debentures, whether or not secured by mortgage and whether or not carrying a right to participate in profits, interest from any other form of indebtedness and all other income assimilated to income from money lent by the law, relating to tax, of the territory in which the income arises.

4.	The provisions of paragraphs 1 and 2 shall not apply if the person beneficially entitled to the interest, being a resident of a territory, carries on business in the other territory, in which the interest arises, through a permanent establishment situated in that other territory, or performs in that other territory independent personal services from a fixed base situated in that other territory, and the indebtedness in respect of which the interest is paid is effectively connected with that permanent establishment or fixed base. In that case the provisions of Article 7 or Article 14, as the case may be, shall apply.

5.	Interest shall be deemed to arise in a territory when the payer is an authority of that territory or a subdivision or local authority of that territory or a person who is a resident of that territory for the purposes of its tax. Where, however, the person paying the interest, whether the person is a resident of a territory or not, has in a territory a permanent establishment or fixed base in connection with which the indebtedness on which the interest is paid was incurred, and that interest is borne by that permanent establishment or fixed base, then the interest shall be deemed to arise in the territory in which the permanent establishment or fixed base is situated.

6.	Where, by reason of a special relationship between the payer and the person beneficially entitled to the interest, or between both of them and some other person, the amount of the interest paid, having regard to the indebtedness for which it is paid, exceeds the amount which might have been expected to have been agreed upon by the payer and the person so entitled in the absence of that relationship, the provisions of this Article shall apply only to the lastmentioned amount. In that case, the excess part of the amount of the interest paid shall remain taxable according to the law, relating to tax, of each territory, but subject to the other provisions of this Agreement.

Article 12

Royalties

1.	Royalties arising in a territory, being royalties to which a resident of the other territory is beneficially entitled, may be taxed in that other territory.

2.	However, those royalties may also be taxed in the territory in which they arise, and according to the law of that territory, but the tax so charged shall not exceed 12.5 per cent of the gross amount of the royalties.

3.	The term "royalties" in this Article means payments or credits, whether periodical or not, and however described or computed, to the extent to which they are made as consideration for:

    * (a) the use of, or the right to use, any copyright, patent, design or model, plan, secret formula or process, trademark or other like property or right; or

    * (b) the use of, or the right to use, any industrial, commercial or scientific equipment; or

    * (c) the supply of scientific, technical, industrial or commercial knowledge or information; or

    * (d) the supply of any assistance that is ancillary and subsidiary to, and is furnished as a means of enabling the application or enjoyment of, any such property or right as is mentioned in subparagraph (a), any such equipment as is mentioned in subparagraph (b) or any such knowledge or information as is mentioned in subparagraph (c) of this paragraph; or

    * (e) the reception of, or the right to receive, visual images or sounds, or both, transmitted to the public by:

      * (i) satellite; or

      * (ii) cable, optic fibre or similar technology; or

    * (f) the use in connection with television broadcasting or radio broadcasting, or the right to use in connection with television broadcasting or radio broadcasting, visual images or sounds, or both, transmitted by:

      * (i) satellite; or

      * (ii) cable, optic fibre or similar technology; or

    * (g) the use of, or the right to use:

      * (i) motion picture films; or

      * (ii) films or video tapes for use in connection with television; or

      * (iii) tapes for use in connection with radio broadcasting; or

    * (h) total or partial forbearance in respect of the use or supply of any property or right referred to in this paragraph.

4.	The provisions of paragraphs l and 2 shall not apply if the person beneficially entitled to the royalties, being a resident of a territory, carries on business in the other territory, in which the royalties arise, through a permanent establishment situated in that other territory, or performs in that other territory independent personal services from a fixed base situated in that other territory, and the property or right in respect of which the royalties are paid or credited is effectively connected with that permanent establishment or fixed base. In that case the provisions of Article 7 or Article 14, as the case may be, shall apply.

5.	Royalties shall be deemed to arise in a territory when the payer is an authority of that territory or a subdivision or local authority of that territory or a person who is a resident of that territory for the purposes of its tax. Where, however, the person paying the royalties, whether the person is a resident of a territory or not, has in a territory a permanent establishment or fixed base in connection with which the liability to pay the royalties was incurred, and the royalties are borne by the permanent establishment or fixed base, then the royalties shall be deemed to arise in the territory in which the permanent establishment or fixed base is situated.

6.	Where, by reason of a special relationship between the payer and the person beneficially entitled to the royalties, or between both of them and some other person, the amount of the royalties paid or credited, having regard to what they are paid or credited for, exceeds the amount which might have been expected to have been agreed upon by the payer and the person so entitled in the absence of such relationship, the provisions of this Article shall apply only to the lastmentioned amount. In that case, the excess part of the amount of the royalties paid or credited shall remain taxable according to the law, relating to tax, of each territory, but subject to the other provisions of this Agreement.

4.	Income, profits or gains derived by a resident of a territory from the alienation of shares or comparable interests in a company, the assets of which consist wholly or principally of real property situated in the other territory, may be taxed in that other territory.

2.	Notwithstanding the provisions of paragraph 1, remuneration derived by an individual who is a resident of a territory in respect of an employment exercised in the other territory shall be taxable only in the firstmentioned territory if:

    * (a) the recipient is present in the other territory for a period or periods not exceeding in the aggregate 183 days in any twelve month period commencing or ending in the year of income concerned; and

    * (b) the remuneration is paid by, or on behalf of, an employer who is not a resident of that other territory; and

    * (c) the remuneration is not deductible in determining taxable profits of a permanent establishment or a fixed base which the employer has in that other territory; and

    * (d) the remuneration is, or upon the application of this Article will be, subject to tax in the firstmentioned territory.

3.	Notwithstanding the preceding provisions of this Article, remuneration derived in respect of an employment exercised aboard a ship or aircraft operated by an enterprise of a territory in international traffic shall be taxable only in that territory.

2.	The provisions of paragraph 1 shall not apply to salaries, wages and other similar remuneration in respect of services rendered in connection with any trade or business carried on by any authority referred to in paragraph 1.

Article 22

Methods of elimination of double taxation

Subject to the provisions of the law of a territory from time to time in force relating to the allowance of a credit against tax payable in that territory of tax paid outside that territory (which shall not affect the general principle of this Article), tax paid under the law of the other territory and in accordance with this Agreement, whether directly or by deduction, in respect of income derived by a person who is a resident of the firstmentioned territory from sources in the other territory shall be allowed as a credit against tax payable in the firstmentioned territory in respect of that income. The amount of credit, however, shall not exceed the amount of the tax in the firstmentioned territory on that income computed in accordance with its taxation laws and regulations.

Article 23

Mutual agreement procedure

1.	Where a person considers that the actions of the competent authority of one or both of the territories result or will result for the person in taxation not in accordance with this Agreement, the person may, irrespective of the remedies provided by the domestic law of those territories concerning taxes to which this Agreement applies, present a case to the competent authority of the territory of which the person is a resident. The case must be presented within 3 years from the first notification of the action resulting in taxation not in accordance with this Agreement.

2.	The competent authority shall endeavour, if the claim appears to it to be justified and if it is not itself able to arrive at a satisfactory solution, to resolve the case with the competent authority of the other territory, with a view to the avoidance of taxation which is not in accordance with this Agreement.

Such persons or authorities shall use the information only for such purposes. They may disclose the information in public court proceedings or in judicial decisions.

2.	In no case shall the provisions of paragraph 1 be construed so as to impose on the competent authority of a territory the obligation:
