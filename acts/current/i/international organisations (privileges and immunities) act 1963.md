    * (2) Where, without the consent in writing of the Minister, the name or an abbreviation of the name of an international organisation to which this Act applies, or a seal, emblem or device referred to in paragraph (1)(b):

    * (3) A person shall not be convicted of an offence against this section in respect of the use of an abbreviation of the name of an international organisation to which this Act applies if the use occurred in such circumstances or in relation to such matters as to be unlikely to be taken to imply any connexion with the organisation, unless the prosecution proves that the use was intended to imply such a connexion.

    * (4) The conviction of a person of an offence under this section in respect of the use of a name, abbreviation of a name, seal, emblem or device does not prevent a further conviction of that person in respect of the use of that name, abbreviation, seal, emblem or device at any time after the firstmentioned conviction.

     * (b) it appears to the Minister that the provisions of this Act other than this section do not, or may not, apply in relation to the organisation, but that it is desirable that juridical personality and one or more legal capacities should be conferred on the organisation.

    * (2) The regulations may confer upon a specified organisation juridical personality and such legal capacities as are necessary for the exercise of the powers, and the performance of the functions, of the organisation.

##### 12B  No registration under the GST Act

    * For the purposes of the GST Act, an organisation or person upon which or whom the regulations have conferred privileges and immunities is treated as not carrying on an enterprise when acting in the capacity in respect of which the organisation or person was granted those privileges and immunities.

       * Note: This means that the organisation or person cannot be registered under Division 23 of the GST Act in that capacity.

##### 12C  Organisations that are bodies corporate are not Commonwealth entities
