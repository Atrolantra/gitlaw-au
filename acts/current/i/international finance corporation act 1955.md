    * (ii) seek to bring together investment opportunities, domestic and foreign private capital, and experienced management; and

    * (iii) seek to stimulate, and to help create conditions conducive to, the flow of private capital, domestic and foreign, into productive investment in member countries.

    * (iv) buy and sell securities it has issued or guaranteed or in which it has invested;

Section 9.	_Political Activity Prohibited_

_The Corporation and its officers shall not interfere in the political affairs of any member; nor shall they be influenced in their decisions by the political character of the member or members concerned.

Section 2.	_Suspension of Membership_

_(a)	If a member fails to fulfill any of its obligations to the Corporation, the Corporation may suspend its membership by decision of a majority of the Governors, exercising a majority of the total voting power. The member so suspended shall automatically cease to be a member one year from the date of its suspension unless a decision is taken by the same majority to restore the member to good standing.

(b) While under suspension, a member shall not be entitled to exercise any rights under this Agreement except the right of withdrawal, but shall remain subject to all obligations.

Section 3.	_Suspension or Cessation of Membership in the Bank_

_Any member which is suspended from membership in, or ceases to be a member of, the Bank shall automatically be suspended from membership in, or cease to be a member of, the Corporation, as the case may be.

Section 4.	_Rights and Duties of Governments Ceasing To Be Members_

_(a)	When a government ceases to be a member it shall remain liable for all amounts due from it to the Corporation. The Corporation shall arrange for the repurchase of such government's capital stock as a part of the settlement of accounts with it in accordance with the provisions of this Section, but the government shall have no other rights under this Agreement except as provided in this Section and in Article VIII (c).

(b) The Corporation and the government may agree on the repurchase of the capital stock of the government on such terms as may be appropriate under the circumstances, without regard to the provisions of paragraph (c) below. Such agreement may provide, among other things, for a final settlement of all obligations of the government to the Corporation.

(c) If such agreement shall not have been made within six months after the government ceases to be a member or such other time as the Corporation and such government may agree, the repurchase price of the government's capital stock shall be the value thereof shown by the books of the Corporation on the day when the government ceases to be a member. The repurchase of the capital stock shall be subject to the following conditions:

    * (i) payments for shares of stock may be made from time to time, upon their surrender by the government, in such instalments, at such times and in such available currency or currencies as the Corporation reasonably determines, taking into account the financial position of the Corporation;

    * (ii) any amount due to the government for its capital stock shall be withheld so long as the government or any of its agencies remains liable to the Corporation for payment of any amount and such amount may, at the option of the Corporation, be set off, as it becomes payable, against the amount due from the Corporation;

    * (iii) if the Corporation sustains a net loss on the investments made pursuant to Article III, Section 1, and held by it on the date when the government ceases to be a member, and the amount of such loss exceeds the amount of the reserves provided therefor on such date, such government shall repay on demand the amount by which the repurchase price of its shares of stock would have been reduced if such loss had been taken into account when the repurchase price was determined.

(d) In no event shall any amount due to a government for its capital stock under this Section be paid until six months after the date upon which the government ceases to be a member. If within six months of the date upon which any government ceases to be a member the Corporation suspends operations under Section 5 of this Article, all rights of such government shall be determined by the provisions of such Section 5 and such government shall be considered still a member of the Corporation for purposes of such Section 5, except that it shall have no voting rights.

Section 5.	_Suspension of Operations and Settlement of Obligations_

_(a)	The Corporation may permanently suspend its operations by vote of a majority of the Governors exercising a majority of the total voting power. After such suspension of operations the Corporation shall forthwith cease all activities, except those incident to the orderly realization, conservation and preservation of its assets and settlement of its obligations. Until final settlement of such obligations and distribution of such assets, the Corporation shall remain in existence and all mutual rights and obligations of the Corporation and its members under this Agreement shall continue unimpaired, except that no member shall be suspended or withdraw and that no distribution shall be made to members except as in this Section provided.

(b) No distribution shall be made to members on account of their subscriptions to the capital stock of the Corporation until all liabilities to creditors shall have been discharged or provided for and until the Board of Governors, by vote of a majority of the Governors exercising a majority of the total voting power, shall have decided to make such distribution.

(c) Subject to the foregoing, the Corporation shall distribute the assets of the Corporation to members _pro rata_ in proportion to capital stock held by them, subject, in the case of any member, to prior settlement of all outstanding claims by the Corporation against such member. Such distribution shall be made at such times, in such currencies, and in cash or other assets as the Corporation shall deem fair and equitable. The shares distributed to the several members need not necessarily be uniform in respect of the type of assets distributed or of the currencies in which they are expressed.

(d) Any member receiving assets distributed by the Corporation pursuant to this Section shall enjoy the same rights with respect to such assets as the Corporation enjoyed prior to their distribution.

**WHEREAS at its April 2010 meeting, the Joint Ministerial Committee of the Boards of Governors of the Bank and the Fund on the Transfer of Real Resources to Developing Countries endorsed proposals for the second phase of reforms to enhance the voice and participation of developing countries and countries in transition in the World Bank Group.

WHEREAS in their Report approved on July 20, 2010, the Board of Directors recommends that the Board of Governors approves:

     * (a) an increase in Basic Votes which requires an amendment of the Articles of Agreement of the Corporation as set forth in Part (A) of this Resolution;

     * (b) an increase in the authorized capital stock of the Corporation as set forth in Part (B) of this Resolution;

     * (c) an allocation of shares to members as set forth in Part (C) of this Resolution; and

     * (d) a periodic review of the Corporation's shareholding as set forth in Part (D) of this Resolution.

NOW THEREFORE, the Board of Governors, noting the recommendations and the said Report of the Board of Directors, hereby resolves as set forth below.

 (A) Increase in Basic Votes and Amendment of the Articles of Agreement of the Corporation

The Board of Governors hereby resolves that: 

1.	Article IV, Section 3(a) of the Articles of Agreement of the Corporation shall be amended to read as follows:

    * Section 3.	Voting

       * "(a)	The voting power of each member shall be equal to the sum of its basic votes and share votes.

         * (i) The basic votes of each member shall be the number of votes that results from the equal distribution among all members of 5.55 percent of the aggregate sum of the voting power of all the members, provided that there shall be no fractional basic votes.

         * (ii) The share votes of each member shall be the number of votes that results from the allocation of one vote for each share of stock held."

2.	The amendment above shall enter into force for all members as of the date three months after the Corporation certifies, by formal communication addressed to all members, that three-fifths of the Governors exercising eighty-five percent of the total voting power, have accepted the amendment.

As at 3 December 2010 the amendments are not incorporated in this compilation.
