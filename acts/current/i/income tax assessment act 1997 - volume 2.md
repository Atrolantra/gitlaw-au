##### Guide to Division 40

##### 401  What this Division is about

    * You can deduct an amount equal to the decline in value of a _depreciating asset_ (an asset that has a limited effective life and that is reasonably expected to decline in value over the time it is used) that you hold.

    * That decline is generally measured by reference to the effective life of the asset.

    * You can also deduct amounts for certain other capital expenditure.

##### 4010  Simplified outline of this Division

    * The key concepts about depreciating assets and certain other capital expenditure are outlined below (in **_bold italics_**).

     * (b) to spread the deduction over a period that reflects the time for which the asset can be used to obtain benefits; and

     * (c) to provide deductions for certain other capital expenditure that is not otherwise deductible.

         * Note 1: This Division does not apply to some depreciating assets: see section 4045.

##### Operative provisions

##### 4025  Deducting amounts for depreciating assets

    * You deduct the decline in value

    * (1) You can deduct an amount equal to the decline in value for an income year (as worked out under this Division) of a *depreciating asset that you *held for any time during the year.

         * Note 1: Sections 4070, 4072 and 4075 show you how to work out the decline for most depreciating assets. There is a limit on the decline: see subsections 4070(3), 4072(3) and 4075(7).

         * Note 2: Small business entities can choose to both deduct and work out the amount they can deduct under Division 328.

         * Note 3: Generally, only one taxpayer can deduct amounts for a depreciating asset. However, if you and another taxpayer jointly hold the asset, each of you deduct amounts for it: see section 4035.

    * Reduction of deduction

    * (2) You must reduce your deduction by the part of the asset's decline in value that is attributable to your use of the asset, or your having it *installed ready for use, for a purpose other than a *taxable purpose.

         * Example: Ben holds a depreciating asset that he uses for private purposes for 30% of his total use in the income year.

         * If the asset declines by $1,000 for the year, Ben would have to reduce his deduction by $300 (30% of $1,000).

    *  Further reduction: leisure facilities

    * (3) You may have to make a further reduction for a *depreciating asset that is a *leisure facility attributable to your use of it, or your having it *installed ready for use, for a *taxable purpose.

    * (4) That reduction is the part of the *leisure facility's decline in value that is attributable to your use of it, or your having it *installed ready for use, at a time when:

     * (a) its use did not constitute a *fringe benefit; or

     * (b) you did not use it or *hold it for use as mentioned in paragraph 2650(3)(b) (about using it in the course of your business or for your employees).

    *  Exception: lowvalue pools

    * (5) Subsections (2), (3) and (4) do not apply to *depreciating assets allocated to a lowvalue pool.

    * Despite subsection (1), you can continue to deduct an amount equal to the decline in value for an income year (as worked out under this Division) of such an asset even though you do not continue to *hold that asset.

         * Note: See Subdivision 40E for lowvalue pools.

    *  Exception: Use of 1/3 of actual expenses method for a car

    * (6) Subsections (2), (3) and (4) do not apply to a *car for an income year for which you use the "onethird of actual expenses" method. Instead, you reduce your deduction by 2/3 of the car's decline in value.

         * Note: See Division 28 for that method.

    * Meaning of taxable purpose

    * (7) Subject to subsection (8), a **_taxable purpose_** is:

     * (a) the *purpose of producing assessable income; or

     * (b) the purpose of *exploration or prospecting; or

     * (c) the purpose of *mining site rehabilitation; or

     * (d) *environmental protection activities.

         * Note 1: Where you have had a deduction under this Division an amount may be included in your assessable income if the expenditure was financed by limited recourse debt that has terminated: see Division 243.

         * Note 2: When this Division notionally applies under section 355310 (about depreciating assets used for R&D activities), the taxable purpose is sometimes only the purpose of conducting R&D activities.

    * (8) If Division 250 applies to you and an asset that is a *depreciating asset:

     * (a) if section 250150 applies--you are taken to be using the asset for a *taxable purpose to the extent specified in a determination made under subsection 250150(3); or

     * (b) otherwise--you are taken not to be using the asset for such a purpose.

##### 4030  What a depreciating asset is

    * (1) A **_depreciating asset_** is an asset that has a limited *effective life and can reasonably be expected to decline in value over the time it is used, except:

     * (a) land; or

     * (b) an item of *trading stock; or

     * (c) an intangible asset, unless it is mentioned in subsection (2).

    * (2) These intangible assets are **_depreciating assets_** if they are not *trading stock:

     * (a) *mining, quarrying or prospecting rights;

     * (b) *mining, quarrying or prospecting information;

     * (c) items of *intellectual property;

     * (d) *inhouse software;

     * (e) *IRUs;

     * (f) *spectrum licences;

     * (g) *datacasting transmitter licences;

     * (h) *telecommunications site access rights.

    * (3) This Division applies to an improvement to land, or a fixture on land, whether the improvement or fixture is removable or not, as if it were an asset separate from the land.

         * Note 1: Whether such an asset is a depreciating asset depends on whether it falls within the definition in subsection (1).

         * Note 2: This Division does not apply to capital works for which you can deduct amounts under Division 43: see subsection 4045(2).

    * (4) Whether a particular composite item is itself a **_depreciating asset_** or whether its components are separate **_depreciating assets_** is a question of fact and degree which can only be determined in the light of all the circumstances of the particular case.

         * Example 1: A car is made up of many separate components, but usually the car is a depreciating asset rather than each component.

         * Example 2: A floating restaurant consists of many separate components (like the ship itself, stoves, fridges, furniture, crockery and cutlery), but usually these components are treated as separate depreciating assets.

    * (5) This Division applies to a renewal or extension of a *depreciating asset that is a right as if the renewal or extension were a continuation of the original right.

    * (6) This Division applies to a *mining, quarrying or prospecting right (the **_new right_**) as if it were a continuation of another mining, quarrying or prospecting right you *held if:

     * (a) the other right ends; and

     * (b) the new right and the other right relate to the same area, or any difference in area is not significant.

##### 4035  Jointly held depreciating assets

    * (1) This Division and Divisions 41, 328 and 775 apply to a *depreciating asset (the **_underlying asset_**) that you *hold, and that is also held by one or more other entities, as if _your interest in_ the underlying asset were itself the underlying asset.

         * Note: Partners do not hold partnership assets: see section 4040.

    * (2) As a result, the decline in value of the underlying asset is not itself taken into account.

         * Example: Buford Corp owns an office block that it leases to 2 companies, Smokey Pty Ltd and Bandit Pty Ltd. Smokey and Bandit decide to install a fountain in front of the building.

         * They discuss it with Buford who agrees to pay half the cost (because the fountain won't be removable at the end of the lease). Smokey and Bandit split the rest of the cost between them.

         * Smokey and Bandit would each hold the asset under item 3 of the table in section 4040 and Buford would hold it under item 10. They would be joint holders, so each would writeoff its _interest_ in the fountain.

##### 4040  Meaning of hold a depreciating asset

    * Use this table to work out who **_holds_** a *depreciating asset. An entity identified in column 3 of an item in the table as _not _**_holding_** a depreciating asset cannot **_hold_** the asset under another item.

         * Example 1: Power Finance leases a luxury car to Kris who subleases it to Rachael. As lessee, item 1 makes Rachael the holder of the car. Power, as the legal owner, would normally hold the car under item 10.

         * However, item 1 makes it clear that Power, as lessor, does _not_ hold the car. As the lessee, item 1 would normally mean that Kris held the car but, again, she is also a lessor and so is not the holder (she also doesn't have the right to use the car during the sublease).

         * Example 2: Sandra sells a packing machine to Jenny under a hire purchase agreement. Jenny holds the machine under item 6 because, although she is not the legal owner until she exercises her option to purchase, she possesses the machine now and can exercise an option to become its legal owner.

         * Jenny is reasonably expected to exercise that option because the final payment will be well below the expected market value of the machine at the end of the agreement. Sandra, as the machine's legal owner, would normally be its holder under item 10 but item 6 makes it clear that the legal owner is _not_ the holder.

         * Note 1: Some assets may have holders under more than one item in the table.

         * Note 2: As well as hire purchase agreements, items 5 and 6 cover cases like assets subject to chattel mortgages, sales subject to retention of title clauses and assets subject to bare trusts.

##### 4045  Assets to which this Division does not apply

    * Eligible work related items

    * (1) This Division does not apply to an asset that is an eligible work related item for the purposes of section 58X of the _Fringe Benefits Tax Assessment Act 1986_ where the relevant benefit provided by the employer is an expense payment benefit or a property benefit (within the meaning of that Act).

    * Capital works

    * (2) This Division does not apply to capital works for which you can deduct amounts under Division 43, or for which you could deduct amounts under that Division:

     * (a) but for expenditure being incurred, or capital works being started, before a particular day; or

     * (b) had you used the capital works for a purpose relevant to those capital works under section 43140.

         * Note: Section 4320 lists the capital works to which that Division applies.

    * Films

    * (5) This Division does not apply to a *depreciating asset if you or another taxpayer has deducted or can deduct amounts for it under:

     * (a) former Division 10BA of Part III of the _Income Tax Assessment Act 1936_ (about Australian films); or

     * (b) former Division 10B of Part III of that Act if the depreciating asset relates to a copyright in an Australian film within the meaning of that Division.

    * (6) This Division applies to a *depreciating asset that is copyright in a *film where a company is entitled to a *tax offset under section 37655 in respect of the film as if the asset's *cost were reduced by the amount of that offset.

##### 4050  Assets for which you deduct under another Subdivision

    * (1) You cannot deduct an amount, or work out a decline in value, for a *depreciating asset under this Subdivision if you or another taxpayer has deducted or can deduct amounts for it under Subdivision 40F (about primary production depreciating assets), 40G (about capital expenditure of primary producers and other landholders) or 40J (about capital expenditure for the establishment of trees in carbon sink forests).

    * (2) You cannot deduct an amount, or work out a decline in value, for *inhouse software under this Subdivision if you have allocated expenditure on the software to a software development pool under Subdivision 40E.

##### 4053  Alterations etc. to certain depreciating assets

    * (1) These things are not the same *depreciating asset for the purposes of section 4050 and Subdivision 40F:

     * (a) a depreciating asset; and

     * (b) a repair of a capital nature, or an alteration, addition or extension, to that asset that would, if it were a separate depreciating asset, be a *water facility, *fodder storage asset or *fencing asset.

    * (2) These things are not the same *depreciating asset for the purposes of section 4050 and Subdivision 40G:

     * (a) a depreciating asset; and

     * (b) a repair of a capital nature, or an alteration, addition or extension, to that asset that would, if it were a separate depreciating asset, be a *landcare operation.

##### 4055  Use of certain car methods

    * You cannot deduct any amount for the decline in value of a *car for an income year if you use the "cents per kilometre" method, or the "12% of original value" method, for the car for that year.

         * Note: See Division 28 for those methods.

##### 4060  When a depreciating asset starts to decline in value

    * (1) A *depreciating asset you *hold starts to decline in value from when its *start time occurs.

    * (2) The **_start time_** of a *depreciating asset is when you first use it, or have it *installed ready for use, for any purpose.

         * Note: Previous use by a transition entity is ignored: see section 5870.

    * (3) However, there is another **_start time_** for a *depreciating asset you *hold if a *balancing adjustment event referred to in paragraph 40295(1)(b) occurs for the asset and you start to use the asset again. Its second **_start time_** is when you start using it again.

##### 4065  Choice of methods to work out the decline in value

    * (1) You have a choice of 2 methods to work out the decline in value of a *depreciating asset. You must choose to use either the *diminishing value method or the *prime cost method.

         * Note 1: Once you make the choice for an asset, you cannot change it: see section 40130.

         * Note 2: For the diminishing value method, see sections 4070 and 4072. For the prime cost method, see section 4075.

         * Note 3: In some cases you do not have to make the choice because you can deduct the asset's cost: see section 4080.

    *  Exception: asset acquired from associate

    * (2) For a *depreciating asset that you acquire from an *associate of yours where the associate has deducted or can deduct an amount for the asset under this Division, you must use the same method that the associate was using.

         * Note: You can require the associate to tell you which method the associate was using: see section 40140.

    *  Exception: holder changes but user same or associate of former user

    * (3) For a *depreciating asset that you acquire from a former *holder of the asset, you must use the same method that the former holder was using for the asset if:

     * (a) the former holder or another entity (each of which is the **_former user_**) was using the asset at a time before you became the holder; and

     * (b) while you hold the asset, the former user or an *associate of the former user uses the asset.

    * (4) However, you must use the *diminishing value method if:

     * (a) you do not know, and cannot readily find out, which method the former holder was using; or

     * (b) the former holder did not use a method.

    *  Exception: lowvalue pools

    * (5) You work out the decline in value of a *depreciating asset in a lowvalue pool under Subdivision 40E rather than under this Subdivision.

    *  Exception: also notionally deductible under R&D provisions

    * (6) If:

     * (a) only one of the following events has happened:

       * (i) you have deducted one or more amounts under this Division for an asset;

       * (ii) you have been entitled under section 355100 (about R&D) to one or more *tax offsets because you can deduct one or more amounts under section 355305 for an asset; but

     * (b) later, the other event happens for the asset;

    * then, for the purposes of working out the deduction for the later event, you must choose the same method that you chose for the first event.

         * Note 1: Deductions under section 355305 (about decline in value of tangible depreciating assets used for R&D activities) are worked out using a notional application of this Division.

         * Note 2: This subsection applies with changes if you have or could have deducted an amount under former section 73BA of the _Income Tax Assessment Act 1936_ for the asset (see section 4067 of the _Income Tax (Transitional Provisions) Act 1997_).

    * (7) If:

     * (a) the events in paragraph (6)(a) could both arise for the same period for an asset; and

     * (b) neither event has already arisen for the asset;

    * then you must choose the same method for the purposes of working out the deduction for each event.

##### 4070  Diminishing value method

    * (1) You work out the decline in value of a *depreciating asset for an income year using the **_diminishing value method_** in this way:

    * where: 

    * **_base value_** is:

     * (a) for the income year in which the asset's *start time occurs--its *cost; or

     * (b) for a later year--the sum of its *opening adjustable value for that year and any amount included in the second element of its cost for that year.

    * **_days held_** is the number of days you *held the asset in the income year from its *start time, ignoring any days in that year when you did not use the asset, or have it *installed ready for use, for any purpose.

         * Note 1: If you recalculate the effective life of a depreciating asset, you use that recalculated life in working out your deduction.

         *  You can choose to recalculate effective life because of changed circumstances: see section 40110. That section also requires you to recalculate effective life in some cases.

         * Note 2: The effective life of a vessel can change in some cases: see subsection 40103(2).

    *  Exception: intangibles

    * (2) You cannot use the *diminishing value method to work out the decline in value of:

     * (a) *inhouse software; or

     * (b) an item of *intellectual property (except copyright in a *film); or

     * (c) a *spectrum licence; or

     * (d) a *datacasting transmitter licence; or

     * (e) a *telecommunications site access right.

    * Limit on decline

    * (3) The decline in value of a *depreciating asset under this section for an income year cannot be more than the amount that is the asset's *base value for that income year.

##### 4072  Diminishing value method for post9 May 2006 assets

    * (1) You work out the decline in value of a *depreciating asset for an income year using the **_diminishing value method_** in this way if you started to *hold the asset on or after 10 May 2006:

    * where: 

    * **_days held_** has the same meaning as in subsection 4070(1).

         * Note: If you recalculate the effective life of a depreciating asset, you use that recalculated life in working out your deduction.

         *  You can choose to recalculate effective life because of changed circumstances: see section 40110. That section also requires you to recalculate effective life in some cases.

    *  Exception: intangibles

    * (2) You cannot use the *diminishing value method to work out the decline in value of:

     * (a) *inhouse software; or

     * (b) an item of *intellectual property (except copyright in a *film); or

     * (c) a *spectrum licence; or

     * (d) a *datacasting transmitter licence; or

     * (e) a *telecommunications site access right.

    * Limit on decline

    * (3) The decline in value of a *depreciating asset under this section for an income year cannot be more than the amount that is the asset's *base value for that income year.

##### 4075  Prime cost method

    * (1) You work out the decline in value of a *depreciating asset for an income year using the **_prime cost method_** in this way:

    * where: 

    * where: 

    * **_days held_** has the same meaning as in subsection 4070(1).

         * Example: Greg acquires an asset for $3,500 and first uses it on the 26th day of the income year. If the effective life of the asset is 31/3 years, the asset would decline in value in that year by:

         * The asset's adjustable value at the end of the income year is:

    * (2) However, you must adjust the formula in subsection (1) for an income year (the **_change year_**):

     * (a) for which you recalculate the *depreciating asset's *effective life; or

     * (b) after the year in which the asset's start time occurs and in which an amount is included in the second element of the asset's *cost; or

     * (c) for which the asset's *opening adjustable value is reduced under section 4090 (about debt forgiveness); or

     * (d) in which the *remaining effective life of the asset is calculated under section 40103; or

     * (e) for which there is a reduction to the asset's opening adjustable value under paragraph 40365(5)(b) (about involuntary disposals) where you are using the prime cost method; or

     * (f) for which the opening adjustable value of the asset is modified under subsection 2780(3A) or (4), 2785(3) or 2790(3); or

     * (g) for which there is a reduction in the asset's opening adjustable value under section 77570; or

     * (h) for which there is an increase in the asset's opening adjustable value under section 77575.

    * The adjustments apply for the change year and later years.

         * Note 1: For recalculating a depreciating asset's effective life: see section 40110.

         * Note 2: You may also adjust the formula for an income year if you had undeducted core technology expenditure for the asset at the end of your last income year commencing before 1 July 2011 (see section 355605 of the _Income Tax (Transitional Provisions) Act 1997_).

    * (3) The adjustments are:

     * (a) instead of the asset's *cost, you use its *opening adjustable value for the change year plus the amounts (if any) included in the second element of its cost for that year; and

     * (b) instead of the asset's *effective life, you use its *remaining effective life.

    * (4) The **_remaining effective life_** of a *depreciating asset is any period of its *effective life that is yet to elapse as at:

     * (a) the start of the change year; or

     * (b) in the case of a rollover under section 40340--the time when the *balancing adjustment event occurs for the transferor.

         * Note: Effective life is worked out in years and fractions of years.

    * (5) You must also adjust the formula in subsection (1) for an intangible *depreciating asset that:

     * (a) is mentioned in an item in the table in subsection 4095(7) (except item 5, 7 or 8); and

     * (b) you acquire from a former *holder of the asset.

    * The adjustment applies for the income year in which you acquire the asset and later income years.

    * (6) Instead of the asset's *effective life under the table in subsection 4095(7), you use the number of years remaining in that effective life as at the start of the income year in which you acquire the asset.

    * Limit on decline

    * (7) The decline in value of a *depreciating asset under this section for an income year cannot be more than:

     * (a) for the income year in which the asset's *start time occurs--its *cost; or

     * (b) for a later year--the sum of its *opening adjustable value for that year and any amount included in the second element of its cost for that year.

##### 4080  When you can deduct the asset's cost

    * Exploration or prospecting

    * (1) The decline in value of a *depreciating asset you *hold is the asset's *cost if:

     * (a) you first use the asset for *exploration or prospecting for *minerals, or quarry materials, obtainable by *mining and quarrying operations; and

     * (b) when you first use the asset, you do not use it for:

       * (i) development drilling for *petroleum; or

       * (ii) operations in the course of working a mining property, quarrying property or petroleum field; and

     * (c) you satisfy one or more of these subparagraphs at the asset's *start time:

       * (i) you carry on mining and quarrying operations;

       * (ii) it would be reasonable to conclude you proposed to carry on such operations;

       * (iii) you carry on a *business of, or a business that included, exploration or prospecting for minerals or quarry materials obtainable by such operations, and expenditure on the asset was necessarily incurred in carrying on that business; and

     * (d) in a case where the asset is a *mining, quarrying or prospecting right--you acquired the asset from an *Australian government agency or a *government entity; and

     * (e) in a case where the asset is *mining, quarrying or prospecting information:

       * (i) you acquired the asset from an Australian government agency or a government entity; or

       * (ii) the asset is a geophysical or geological data package you acquired from an entity to which subsection (1AA) applies; or

       * (iii) you created the asset, or contributed to the cost of its creation; or

       * (iv) you caused the asset to be created, or contributed to the cost of it being created, by an entity to which subsection (1AA) applies.

    * (1AA) This subsection applies to an entity if, at the time of the acquisition referred to in subparagraph (1)(e)(ii) or the creation referred to in subparagraph (1)(e)(iv), the entity predominantly carries on a *business of providing *mining, quarrying or prospecting information to other entities that:

     * (a) carry on *mining and quarrying operations; or

     * (b) it would be reasonable to conclude propose to carry on such operations; or

     * (c) carry on a business of, or a business that included, *exploration or prospecting for *minerals or quarry materials obtainable by such operations.

    * (1AB) If an amount is included in the second element of the *cost of a *depreciating asset, subsection (1) applies in relation to that amount only if:

     * (a) your first use of the asset, after the inclusion of the amount in the second element, is for *exploration or prospecting for *minerals, or quarry materials, obtainable by *mining and quarrying operations; and

     * (b) at the time of that first use:

       * (i) you satisfy paragraph (1)(b) as if that first use was your first use of the asset; and

       * (ii) you satisfy paragraph (1)(c) as if the time of that first use was the asset's *start time; and

     * (c) if the amount relates to a *mining, quarrying or prospecting right--after the inclusion of the amount in the second element, you satisfy paragraph (1)(d) in relation to the right; and

     * (d) if the amount relates to *mining, quarrying or prospecting information--after the inclusion of the amount in the second element, you satisfy paragraph (1)(e) in relation to the information.

    * (1AC) If subsection (1) does not apply to a *depreciating asset:

     * (a) the fact that subsection (1) does not apply to the asset does not prevent the application of subsection (1AB) to an amount included in the second element of the *cost of the asset; but

     * (b) subsection (1) only affects the asset's decline in value to the extent that the asset's cost consists of that amount.

    * Depreciating assets used for certain purposes

    * (2) The decline in value of a *depreciating asset you start to *hold in an income year is the asset's *cost if:

     * (a) that cost does not exceed $300; and

     * (b) you use the asset predominantly for the *purpose of producing assessable income that is not income from carrying on a *business; and

     * (c) the asset is not one that is part of a set of assets that you started to hold in that income year where the total cost of the set of assets exceeds $300; and

     * (d) the total cost of the asset and any other identical, or substantially identical, asset that you start to hold in that income year does not exceed $300.

##### 4085  Meaning of adjustable value and opening adjustable value of a depreciating asset

    * (1) The **_adjustable value_** of a *depreciating asset at a particular time is:

     * (a) if you have not yet used it or had it *installed ready for use for any purpose--its *cost; or

     * (b) for a time in the income year in which you first use it, or have it installed ready for use, for any purpose--its cost less its decline in value up to that time; or

     * (c) for a time in a later income year--the sum of its *opening adjustable value for that year and any amount included in the second element of its cost for that year up to that time, less its decline in value for that year up to that time.

         * Note: The adjustable value of a depreciating asset may be modified by section 250285.

    * (2) The **_opening adjustable value _**of a *depreciating asset for an income year is its *adjustable value to you at the end of the previous income year.

         * Note: The opening adjustable value of a depreciating asset may be modified by one of these provisions:

           * (a) Subdivision 27B;

           * (b) subsection 4090(3);

           * (c) subsection 40285(4);

##### _4090  Debt forgiveness

    * (1) This section applies if an amount (the **_debt forgiveness amount_**) is applied in reduction of expenditure for a *depreciating asset in an income year under section 245155 or 245157.

    * (2) The asset's *cost is reduced for that income year by the debt forgiveness amount.

    * (3) The asset's *opening adjustable value for that income year is reduced by the debt forgiveness amount if that income year is later than the one in which its *start time occurs.

##### 4095  Choice of determining effective life

    * (1) You must choose either:

     * (a) to use an *effective life determined by the Commissioner for a *depreciating asset under section 40100; or

     * (b) to work out the effective life of the asset yourself under section 40105.

         * Note: If you choose to use an effective life determined by the Commissioner for a depreciating asset, a capped life may apply to the asset under section 40102.

    * (2) Your choice of an *effective life determined by the Commissioner for a *depreciating asset is limited to one in force as at:

     * (a) the time when you entered into a contract to acquire the asset, you otherwise acquired it or you started to construct it if its *start time occurs within 5 years of that time; or

     * (b) for *plant that you entered into a contract to acquire, you otherwise acquired or you started to construct before 11.45 am, by legal time in the Australian Capital Territory, on 21 September 1999--the time when you entered into the contract to acquire it, otherwise acquired it or started to construct it; or

     * (c) otherwise--its *start time.

    * (3) You must make the choice for the income year in which the asset's *start time occurs.

         * Note: For rules about choices: see section 40130.

    *  Exception: asset acquired from associate

    * (4) For a *depreciating asset that you start to *hold where the former holder is an *associate of yours and the associate has deducted or can deduct an amount for the asset under this Division, you must use:

     * (a) if the associate was using the *diminishing value method for the asset--the same *effective life that the associate was using; or

     * (b) if the associate was using the *prime cost method--an effective life equal to any period of the asset's effective life the associate was using that is yet to elapse at the time you started to hold it.

         * Note: You can require the associate to tell you which effective life the associate was using: see section 40140.

    * (4A) Subsection (4) does not apply to a *depreciating asset if subsection (4B) or (4C) applies to the asset.

    * (4B) For a *depreciating asset that you start to *hold if:

     * (d) a different item in the tables in subsections 40102(4) and (5) applies to the asset when you start to hold it; and

     * (e) the item referred to in paragraph (d) would have applied to the asset at the relevant time for the associate if the use to which the asset were put at that time were the use (the **_new use_**) to which it is put when you start to hold it;

     * (f) if the associate was using the *diminishing value method for the asset--an *effective life equal to the _*_capped life that would have applied to the asset under subsection 40102(4) or (5) at the relevant time for the associate if the use to which the asset were put at that time were the new use; or

     * (g) if the associate was using the *prime cost method--an effective life equal to the capped life that:

    * (5B) For a *depreciating asset that you start to *hold if:

     * (a) paragraphs (5)(a) and (b) apply; and

     * (b) section 40102 applied to the asset immediately before you started to hold it because an item in the tables in subsections 40102(4) and (5) applied to it at the relevant time (the **_relevant time for the former holder_**) that applied to the former holder under subsection 40102(3); and

     * (c) a different item in the tables in subsections 40102(4) and (5) applies to the asset when you start to hold it; and

     * (d) the item referred to in paragraph (c) would have applied to the asset at the relevant time for the former holder if the use to which the asset were put at that time were the use (the **_new use_**) to which it is put when you start to hold it;

       * (ii) subsection (5B) would apply to the asset but for paragraph (d) of that subsection not being satisfied;

    * you must use: 

     * (d) if the former holder was using the *diminishing value method for the asset--the *effective life determined by the Commissioner for the asset under section 40100 that the former holder would have used if section 40102 had not applied to the asset; or

     * (e) if the former holder was using the *prime cost method--an effective life equal to any period of the effective life determined by the Commissioner for the asset under section 40100 that:

       * (i) the former holder would have used if section 40102 had not applied to the asset; and

       * (ii) is yet to elapse at the time you start to hold it.

    * (6) However, you must use an *effective life determined by the Commissioner if:

     * (a) you do not know, and cannot readily find out, which effective life the former holder was using and, if subsection (5B) or (5C) applied to the asset, either of the following matters:

       * (i) the effective life the former holder would have used if section 40102 had not applied to the asset;

       * (ii) the relevant time that applied to the former holder under subsection 40102(3); or

     * (b) the former holder did not use an effective life.

    *  Exception: intangible depreciating assets

    * (7) The **_effective life_** of an intangible *depreciating asset mentioned in this table is the period applicable to that asset under the table.

    * (8) The **_effective life_** of an intangible *depreciating asset that is not mentioned in the table in subsection (7) and is not an *IRU or a *mining, quarrying or prospecting right cannot be longer than the term of the asset as extended by any reasonably assured extension or renewal of that term.

    * (9) The **_effective life_** of an *IRU is the *effective life of the telecommunications cable over which the IRU is granted.

    *  Exceptions: mining, quarrying or prospecting rights and mining, quarrying or prospecting information

    * (10) Subject to subsection (12), the **_effective life _**of:

     * (a) a *mining, quarrying or prospecting right; or

     * (b) *mining, quarrying or prospecting information;

    * is the period you work out yourself by estimating the period (in years, including fractions of years) set out in column 2 of this table:

    * (10A) However, if the only reason that subsection 4080(1) does not apply to the *mining, quarrying or prospecting right, or *mining, quarrying or prospecting information, is that the right or information does not meet the requirements of paragraph 4080(1)(d) or (e), the **_effective life _**of the right or information is the shorter of:

     * (a) the period that would, apart from this subsection, be the effective life of the information or right under subsection (10); and

     * (b) 15 years.

    * (11) You work out the period in subsection (10):

     * (a) as from the *start time of the *mining, quarrying or prospecting right or *mining, quarrying or prospecting information; and

     * (b) by reference only to the period of time over which the reserves, reasonably estimated using an appropriate accepted industry practice, are expected to be extracted from the mine, *petroleum field or quarry.

    * (12) The **_effective life _**of a *mining, quarrying or prospecting right, or *mining, quarrying or prospecting information, is 15 years if the right or information does not relate to:

     * (a) a mine or proposed mine; or

     * (b) a petroleum field or proposed petroleum field; or

     * (c) a quarry or proposed quarry.

##### 40100  Commissioner's determination of effective life

    * (1) The Commissioner may make a written determination specifying the **_effective life_** of *depreciating assets. The determination may specify conditions for particular depreciating assets.

    * (2) A determination may specify a day from which it takes effect for *depreciating assets specified in the determination.

    * (3) A determination may operate retrospectively to a day specified in the determination if:

     * (a) there was no applicable determination at that day for the *depreciating asset covered by the determination; or

     * (b) the determination specifies a shorter *effective life for the depreciating asset covered by the determination than was previously applicable.

    * Criteria for making a determination

    * (4) The Commissioner is to make a determination of the **_effective life_** of a *depreciating asset in accordance with subsections (5) and (6).

    * (5) Firstly, estimate the period (in years, including fractions of years) the asset can be used by any entity for one or more of the following purposes:

     * (a) a *taxable purpose;

     * (b) the purpose of producing *exempt income or *nonassessable nonexempt income;

     * (c) the purpose of conducting *R&D activities, assuming that this is reasonably likely.

    * (6) Secondly, if relevant for the asset:

     * (a) assume the asset will be subject to wear and tear at a rate that is reasonable for the Commissioner to assume; and

     * (b) assume the asset will be maintained in reasonably good order and condition; and

     * (c) have regard to the period within which the asset is likely to be scrapped, sold for no more than scrap value or abandoned.

    * However, for paragraph (c), disregard reasons attributable to the technical risk in conducting *R&D activities if it is reasonably likely that the asset will be used for such activities.

##### 40102  Capped life of certain depreciating assets

    * (1) If this section applies to a *depreciating asset, the **_effective life_** of the asset is the period (the **_capped life)_** that applies to the asset under subsection (4) or (5) at the relevant time (which is worked out using subsection (3)).

    * Working out if this section applies

    * (2) This section applies to a *depreciating asset if:

     * (a) you choose, under paragraph 4095(1)(a), to use an *effective life determined by the Commissioner for the asset under section 40100; and

     * (b) your choice is limited to a determination in force at the time mentioned in paragraph 4095(2)(a) or (c); and

     * (c) a *capped life applies to the asset under subsection (4) or (5) at the relevant time (which is worked out using subsection (3)); and

     * (d) the capped life is shorter than the effective life mentioned in paragraph (a).

    * (3) For the purposes of this section, the relevant time is:

     * (a) the *start time of the *depreciating asset if:

       * (i) paragraph 4095(2)(c) applies to you; or

       * (ii) paragraph 4095(2)(a) applies to you and a *capped life does not apply to the asset under subsection (4) or (5) at the time mentioned in that paragraph; or

       * (iii) paragraph 4095(2)(a) applies to you and the capped life that applies to the asset under subsection (4) or (5) at the time mentioned in that paragraph is longer than the capped life that applies to the asset at its start time; or

     * (b) if paragraph (a) does not apply--the time mentioned in paragraph 4095(2)(a).

    * Capped life

    * (4) If the *depreciating asset corresponds exactly to the description in column 2 of the table, the **_capped life_** of the asset is the period specified in column 3 of the table.

    * (4A) Item 10 of the table in subsection 40102(4) does not apply to a vessel if:

     * (a) *ordinary income that you *derive, or your *statutory income, in relation to the vessel; or

     * (b) ordinary income that your *associate derives, or your associate's statutory income, in relation to the vessel;

    * is exempt from income tax under section 51100 for the income year for which you are working out the vessel's decline in value.

    * (5) If the *depreciating asset is of a kind described in column 2 of the table and is used in the industry specified in column 3 of the table for the asset, the **_capped life_** of the asset is the period specified in column 4 of the table.

##### 40103  Effective life and remaining effective life of certain vessels

    * (1) If, at a particular time, item 10 of the table in subsection 40102(4):

     * (a) starts to apply to a vessel (whether or not that item has previously applied to the vessel); or

     * (b) ceases to apply to a vessel (whether or not that item subsequently applies to the vessel);

    * at that time the **_effective life_** of the vessel changes accordingly.

    * (2) If subsection (1) applies and the decline in value of the vessel is worked out using the *prime cost method, the **_remaining effective life_** of the vessel just after that time is:

    * where: 

    * **_alternative effective life_** is:

     * (a) if that item starts to apply to the vessel at that time--what would have been the *effective life of the vessel just before that time if that item had applied to the vessel; or

     * (b) if that item ceases to apply to the vessel at that time--what would have been the effective life of the vessel just before that time if that item had not applied to the vessel.

    * **_unadjusted effective life_** is what was the *effective life of the vessel just before that time.

    * **_unadjusted remaining effective life_** is what was the *remaining effective life of the vessel just before that time.

         * Example: Assume that item 10 of the table in subsection 40102(4) ceases to apply to a vessel after having applied to the vessel for 7 years, and again starts to apply after another 4 years. Assume further that the effective life of a vessel of that kind has been determined under section 40100 to be 20 years.

         * The remaining effective life of the vessel just before that item ceases to apply to the vessel is 3 years. Its alternative effective life is 20 years, and its unadjusted effective life is 10 years. Its remaining effective life just after that time is therefore 6 years.

         * The remaining effective life of the vessel just before that item again starts to apply to the vessel is 2 years. Its alternative effective life is 10 years, and its unadjusted effective life is 20 years. Its remaining effective life just after that time is therefore 1 year.

##### 40105  Selfassessing effective life

    * (1) You work out the **_effective life_** of a *depreciating asset yourself in accordance with this section.

    * (1A) Firstly, estimate the period (in years, including fractions of years) the asset can be used by any entity for one or more of the following purposes:

     * (a) a *taxable purpose;

     * (b) the purpose of producing *exempt income or *nonassessable nonexempt income;

     * (c) the purpose of conducting *R&D activities, assuming that this is reasonably likely.

    * (1B) Secondly, if relevant for the asset:

     * (a) have regard to the wear and tear you reasonably expect from your expected circumstances of use; and

     * (b) assume that the asset will be maintained in reasonably good order and condition.

    * (2) If, in working out that period, you decide that the asset would be likely to be:

     * (a) scrapped; or

     * (b) sold for no more than scrap value or abandoned;

    * before the end of that period, its **_effective life_** ends at the earlier time. However, when making your decision, disregard reasons attributable to the technical risk in conducting *R&D activities if it is reasonably likely that the asset will be used for such activities.

    * (3) You work out the period mentioned in subsection (1A) or (2) beginning at the *start time of the *depreciating asset.

    *  Exception: intangibles

    * (4) This section does not apply to the following intangible *depreciating assets:

     * (a) assets to which an item in the table in subsection 4095(7) applies;

     * (b) *mining, quarrying or prospecting rights;

     * (c) *mining, quarrying or prospecting information.

##### 40110  Recalculating effective life

    * (1) You may choose to recalculate the *effective life of a *depreciating asset from a later income year if the effective life you have been using is no longer accurate because of changed circumstances relating to the nature of the use of the asset.

         * Example: Some examples of changes in circumstances that may result in your recalculating the effective life of a depreciating asset are:

           *  	your use of the asset turns out to be more or less rigorous than you expected (or was anticipated by the Commissioner's determination);

           *  	there is a downturn in demand for the goods or services the asset is used to produce that will result in the asset being scrapped;

           *  	legislation prevents the asset's continued use;

           *  	changes in technology make the asset redundant;

           *  	there is an unexpected demand, or lack of success, for a film.

    * (2) You must recalculate a *depreciating asset's *effective life from a later income year if:

     * (a) you:

       * (i) selfassessed its effective life; or

       * (ii) are using an effective life worked out under section 40100 (about the Commissioner's determination), or 40102 (about the capped life of certain depreciating assets), and the *prime cost method; or

       * (iii) are using an effective life because of subsection 4095(4), (4B), (4C), (5), (5B) or (5C); and

     * (b) its *cost is increased in that year by at least 10%.

         * Note 1: You may conclude that the effective life is the same.

         * Note 2: For the elements of the cost of a depreciating asset, see Subdivision 40C.

         * Example 1: Paul purchases a photocopier and selfassesses its effective life at 6 years. In a later year he incurs expenditure to increase the quality of the reproductions it makes. He recalculates its effective life, but concludes that it remains the same.

         * Example 2: Fiona also purchases a photocopier and selfassesses its effective life at 6 years. In a later year she incurs expenditure to incorporate a more robust paper handling system. She recalculates its effective life, and concludes that it is increased to 7 years.

    * (3) You must recalculate a *depreciating asset's *effective life for the income year in which you started to *hold it if:

     * (a) you are using an effective life because of subsection 4095(4), (4B), (4C), (5), (5B) or (5C); and

     * (b) the asset's *cost is increased after you started to hold it in that year by at least 10%.

    * (3A) Subsections (1), (2) and (3) do not apply to a *depreciating asset that is a *mining, quarrying or prospecting right or *mining, quarrying or prospecting information.

    * (3B) You may choose to recalculate the *effective life of a *mining, quarrying or prospecting right, or *mining, quarrying or prospecting information, from a later income year if the effective life you have been using is no longer accurate:

     * (a) because of changed circumstances relating to an existing or proposed mine, petroleum field or quarry to which that right or information relates; or

     * (b) because that right or information now relates to an existing or proposed mine, petroleum field or quarry; or

     * (c) because that right or information no longer relates to an existing or proposed mine, petroleum field or quarry.

    * (4) A recalculation under this section must be done using:

     * (a) if paragraph (b) does not apply--section 40105 (about selfassessing effective life); or

     * (b) if the *depreciating asset is a *mining, quarrying or prospecting right or *mining, quarrying or prospecting information:

       * (i) subsections 4095(10) and (11) (if the right or information relates to an existing or proposed mine, petroleum field or quarry); or

       * (ii) subsection 4095(12) (if the right or information no longer relates to an existing or proposed mine, petroleum field or quarry).

    *  Exception: intangibles

    * (5) This section does not apply to an intangible *depreciating asset to which an item in the table in subsection 4095(7) applies.

##### 40115  Splitting a depreciating asset

    * (1) If a *depreciating asset you *hold is split into 2 or more assets, this Division applies as if you had stopped holding the original asset and started holding the assets into which it is split.

         * Note 1: For the cost of the split assets, see section 40205.

         * Note 2: A balancing adjustment event does not occur just because you split a depreciating asset: see section 40295.

    * (2) If you stop *holding part of a *depreciating asset, this Division applies as if, just before you stopped holding that part, you had split the original asset into the part you stopped holding and the rest of the original asset. (The rest of the original asset is then taken to be a different asset from the original asset.)

         * Example: Bronwyn sells Tim a part interest in a depreciating asset she owns. They become joint holders under section 4035. She is taken to have split the underlying asset into the interest she retains and the interest Tim buys. She now holds an interest (a new depreciating asset) in the underlying asset and is taken to have stopped holding the interest sold.

    * (3) If you grant or assign an interest in an item of *intellectual property, subsection (2) applies to you as if you had stopped *holding part of the item.

##### 40120  Replacement spectrum licences

    * (1) If:

     * (a) some (but not all) of a *spectrum licence you *hold is assigned or resumed; and

     * (b) your original licence is replaced by one or more other spectrum licences (possibly including a modified version of your original licence); and

     * (c) the replacement licences together cover exactly the same rights as were covered by your original licence just after the assignment or resumption;

    * this Division applies as if your original licence (as it existed just after the assignment or resumption) had been split into the replacement licences.

         * Example: MGP Communications Ltd buys a spectrum licence on 1 July 2003 for $5 million. The licence specifies areas A, B, C and D. The company assigns the spectrum relating to area C. Area C represents 20% of the market value of the overall licence. $1m of the adjustable value is allocated to it and $4m is allocated to the remaining licence.

         * The Australian Communications and Media Authority adjusts the licence to specify only areas A and B, and issues a new licence specifying area D.

         * Area D represents 25% of the market value of the spectrum remaining in the licence. The adjustable value of the new licence is therefore $1m and the adjustable value of the original (modified) licence is $3m.

    * (2) If a *spectrum licence you *hold is replaced by 2 or more spectrum licences (possibly including a modified version of your original licence) that together cover exactly the same rights as your original licence, this Division applies as if the original licence had been split into the replacement licences.

##### 40125  Merging depreciating assets

    * If a *depreciating asset or assets that you *hold is or are merged into another depreciating asset, this Division applies as if you had stopped holding the original asset or assets and started holding the merged asset.

         * Note 1: For the cost of the merged asset, see section 40210.

         * Note 2: A balancing adjustment event does not occur just because you merge depreciating assets: see section 40295.

##### 40130  Choices

    * (1) A choice you can make under this Division about a *depreciating asset must be made:

     * (a) by the day you lodge your *income tax return for the income year to which the choice relates; or

     * (b) within a further time allowed by the Commissioner.

    * (2) Your choice, once made, applies to that income year and all later income years.

    *  Exception: recalculating effective life

    * (3) However, subsection (2) does not apply to a choice to recalculate the *effective life of a *depreciating asset under section 40110.

##### 40135  Certain antiavoidance provisions

    * These antiavoidance provisions: 

     * (a) section 51AD (Deductions not allowable in respect of property under certain leveraged arrangements) of the _Income Tax Assessment Act 1936_;

     * (b) Division 16D (Certain arrangements relating to the use of property) of Part III of that Act;

    * apply to your deductions under this Division for a *depreciating asset you *hold as if you were the owner of the asset instead of any other person.

##### 40140  Getting tax information from associates

    * (1) If you acquire a *depreciating asset from an *associate of yours where the associate has deducted or can deduct an amount for the asset under this Division, you may give the associate a written notice requiring the associate to tell you:

     * (a) the method the associate was using to work out the decline in value of the asset; and

     * (b) the *effective life the associate was using; and 

     * (c) if section 40102 applied to the asset at any time:

       * (i) the effective life that the associate would have used if section 40102 had not applied to the asset; and

       * (ii) the relevant time that applied to the associate under subsection 40102(3).

    * (2) The notice must:

     * (a) be given within 60 days of your acquiring the asset; and

     * (b) specify a period of at least 60 days within which the information must be given; and

     * (c) set out the effect of subsection (3).

         * Note: Subsections (4) and (5) explain how this subsection operates if the associate is a partnership.

    * Requirement to comply with notice

    * (3) The *associate must not intentionally refuse or fail to comply with the notice.

       * Penalty: 10 penalty units.

    * Giving the notice to a partnership

    * (4) If the *associate is a partnership:

     * (a) you may give it to the partnership by giving it to any of the partners (this does not limit how else you can give it); and

     * (b) the obligation to comply with the notice is imposed on each of the partners (not on the partnership), but may be discharged by any of them.

    * (5) A partner must not intentionally refuse or fail to comply with that obligation, unless another partner has already complied with it.

       * Penalty: 10 penalty units.

    * Limits on giving a notice

    * (6) Only one notice can be given in relation to the same *depreciating asset.

##### Subdivision 40C--Cost

##### Guide to Subdivision 40C

##### 40170  What this Subdivision is about

    * Your cost of a depreciating asset is a component in working out the amounts you can deduct for it.

    * There are 2 elements of the cost of a depreciating asset. This Subdivision shows you how to work out those elements.

##### Table of sections

  * Operative provisions

      * 40175	Cost

      * 40180	First element of cost

      * 40185	Amount you are taken to have paid to hold a depreciating asset or to receive a benefit

      * 40190	Second element of cost

      * 40195	Apportionment of cost

      * 40200	Exclusion from cost

      * 40205	Cost of a split depreciating asset

      * 40210	Cost of merged depreciating assets

      *  40215	Adjustment: double deduction

      * 40220	Cost reduced by amounts not of a capital nature

      * 40222	Cost reduced by water infrastructure improvement expenditure

      *  40225	Adjustment: acquiring a car at a discount

      *  40230	Adjustment: car limit

      *  40235	Adjustment: National Disability Insurance Scheme costs

##### Operative provisions

##### 40175  Cost

    * The **_cost_** of a *depreciating asset you *hold consists of 2 elements.

         * Note: The cost of a depreciating asset may be modified by one of these provisions:

           *  	Subdivision 27B;

           *  	subsection 4090(2);

           *  	paragraph 40362(3)(c);

           *  	paragraph 40365(5)(a);

           *  	section 77570;

           *  	section 77575.

##### 40180  First element of cost

    * (1) The first element is worked out as at the time when you began to *hold the *depreciating asset (except for a case to which item 3, 4 or 14 of the table in subsection (2) applies). It is:

     * (a) if an item in that table applies--the amount specified in that item; or

     * (b) otherwise--the amount you are taken to have paid to hold the asset under section 40185.

         * Note 1: The first element of the cost may be modified by a later provision in this Subdivision.

         * Note 2: Section 230505 provides special rules for working out the amount of consideration for an asset if the asset is a Division 230 financial arrangement or a Division 230 financial arrangement is involved in that consideration.

    * (2) If more than one item in this table covers the asset, apply the last item that covers it.

    * (3) The first element of *cost includes an amount you paid or are taken to have paid in relation to starting to *hold the *depreciating asset if that amount is directly connected with holding the asset.

    * (4) The first element of *cost of a *depreciating asset does not include an amount that forms part of the second element of cost of another depreciating asset.

##### 40185  Amount you are taken to have paid to hold a depreciating asset or to receive a benefit

    * (1) This Division applies to you as if you had paid, to *hold a *depreciating asset or for an economic benefit for such an asset, the greater of these amounts:

     * (a) the sum of the amounts that would have been included in your assessable income because you started to hold the asset or received the benefit, or because you gave something to start holding the asset or receive the benefit, if you ignored the value of anything you gave that reduced the amount actually included; or

     * (b) the sum of the applicable amounts set out in this table in relation to holding the asset or receiving the benefit.

         * Example 1: Gold Medals Ltd manufactures some medals for a local sporting association's annual meeting in return for a die cut stamping machine. The medals have a market value of $20,000. The machine has an arm's length value of $100,000 but Gold Medals has to contribute $75,000 towards acquiring it from the association. Gold Medals will have to include:

         * in its assessable income because of section 21A of the _Income Tax Assessment Act 1936_.

         * The first element of the machine's cost will be the greater of:

           *  	the amount it paid ($75,000) plus the market value of the noncash benefits it provided ($20,000), which comes to $95,000; and

           *  	the amount that was assessable income from receiving the machine ($25,000) plus the amount by which that assessable income was reduced because of the payment Gold Medals made ($75,000), which comes to $100,000.

         * So, in this case, the first element of the machine's cost to Gold Medals is $100,000.

         * Example 2: Laura travels overseas to purchase a purposebuilt vehicle for use in her trade. The purchase of the vehicle is the sole reason for the trip. Laura incurs expenses for airfares and accommodation. These expenses are included in the cost of the vehicle because they are "in relation to starting to hold" the vehicle.

         * Note 1: Item 1 includes not only amounts actually paid but also amounts taken to have been paid. Examples include the price of the notional purchase made when trading stock is converted to a depreciating asset under section 70110, the cost of an asset held under a hire purchase arrangement under section 24025 and a lessor's deemed purchase price when a luxury car lease ends under subsection 24290(3).

         * Note 2: Section 230505 provides special rules for working out the amount of consideration for an asset if the asset is a Division 230 financial arrangement or a Division 230 financial arrangement is involved in that consideration.

    * (2) In applying the table in subsection (1) to a liability of yours to pay an amount or provide a *noncash benefit, don't count any part of the liability you have already satisfied.

##### 40190  Second element of cost

    * (1) The second element is worked out after you start to *hold the *depreciating asset.

    * (2) The second element is:

     * (a) the amount you are taken to have paid under section 40185 for each economic benefit that has contributed to bringing the asset to its present condition and location from time to time since you started to *hold the asset; and

     * (b) expenditure you incur that is reasonably attributable to a *balancing adjustment event occurring for the asset.

         * Example 1: Andrew adds a new tray and canopy to his ute. The materials and labour that go into the addition are economic benefits that Andrew received and that contribute to the ute's present condition.

         * The payments he makes for those economic benefits are included in the second element of the ute's cost.

         * Example 2: Leonie needed to replace one of her old depreciating assets that was fixed to her land with a new, more efficient one. Leonie paid a contractor a fee to demolish and remove the old asset. This resulted in a balancing adjustment event occurring for the old asset, and the fee forms part of the second element of the cost of the old asset that was demolished.

         * Note: The second element of the cost may be modified by a later provision in this Subdivision.

    * (2A) Paragraph (2)(b) does not apply to a *balancing adjustment event referred to in item 6 or 11 of the table in subsection 40300(2).

    * (3) However, the second element is worked out using this table if an item in it applies. Use the last applicable item.

##### 40195  Apportionment of cost

    * If you pay an amount for 2 or more things that include at least one *depreciating asset, or that include a contribution to bringing a depreciating asset to its present condition and location, you take into account as part of its *cost only that part of what you paid that is reasonably attributable to the asset.

         * Example: Ian buys 3 assets (one depreciating asset and 2 other assets) under the one transaction. He pays $30,000 for the 3 assets. $25,000 of that amount is reasonably attributable to the depreciating asset.

         * The first element of the depreciating asset's _cost_ is $25,000.

##### 40200  Exclusion from cost

    * The *cost of a *depreciating asset that is not *plant does not include any amount that was incurred:

     * (a) before 1 July 2001; or

     * (b) under a contract entered into before that day.

##### 40205  Cost of a split depreciating asset

    * If you split a *depreciating asset into separate assets as mentioned in section 40115, the first element of the **_cost_** of each of the separate assets is a reasonable proportion of the sum of these amounts:

     * (a) the *adjustable value of the original asset just before it was split; and

     * (b) the amount you are taken to have paid under section 40185 for any economic benefit involved in splitting the original asset.

         * Example: Barry owns a spectrum licence that covers 3 areas: Area A, area B and area C. The licence has an adjustable value of $160,000. He sells area A to Chris, and his costs of splitting are $10,000. Barry is taken to have split the licence into 2 assets.

         * On the basis of their relative market values, Barry apportions $170,000 to area A (that he disposed of) and to the licence he still holds for areas B and C.

##### 40210  Cost of merged depreciating assets

    * If a *depreciating asset or assets that you *hold is or are merged into another depreciating asset as mentioned in section 40125, the first element of the **_cost_** of the merged asset is a reasonable proportion of the sum of:

     * (a) the *adjustable value or adjustable values of the original asset or assets just before the merger; and

     * (b) the amount you are taken to have paid under section 40185 for any economic benefit involved in merging the original asset or assets.

##### 40215  Adjustment: double deduction

    * Each element of the *cost of a *depreciating asset is reduced by any portion of that element of cost that you have deducted or can deduct, or that has been or will be taken into account in working out an amount you can deduct, other than under this Division, Division 41 or Division 328.

         * Note: This section does not apply to notional deductions under section 355305 or 355520 (about R&D) because those provisions are about deducting the asset's decline in value, not its cost.

##### 40220  Cost reduced by amounts not of a capital nature

    * The *cost of a *depreciating asset is reduced by any portion of it that consists of an amount that is not of a capital nature.

##### 40222  Cost reduced by water infrastructure improvement expenditure

    * The *cost of a *depreciating asset is reduced by any portion of it that consists of expenditure that you cannot deduct because of section 26100.

##### 40225  Adjustment: acquiring a car at a discount

    * (1) You must increase the first element of the **_cost_** of a *car designed mainly for carrying passengers you acquire at a discount if:

     * (a) it is reasonable to conclude that any portion (the **_discount portion_**) of the discount is referable to you or another entity selling another asset for less than its *market value; and

     * (b) you, or another entity, has deducted or can deduct an amount for the other asset for any income year; and

     * (c) the sum of the cost of the car and the discount portion exceeds the *car limit for the *financial year in which you first use the car for any purpose.

    * (2) The first element of the **_cost_** of the *car is increased by the discount portion.

    * (3) This section does not apply to a *car that is excluded from the *car limit by subsection 40230(2).

##### 40230  Adjustment: car limit

    * (1) The first element of the **_cost_** of a *car designed mainly for carrying passengers (after applying section 40225 and Subdivision 27B) is reduced to the *car limit for the *financial year in which you started to *hold it if its cost exceeds that limit.

    * (2) However, the *car limit does not apply to a *car:

     * (a) fitted out for transporting disabled people in wheelchairs for profit; or

     * (b) whose first element of *cost exceeds that limit only because of modifications made to enable an individual with a disability to use it for a *taxable purpose.

    * (3) The **_car limit_** for the 200001 *financial year is $55,134. The limit is indexed annually.

         * Note: Subdivision 960M shows you how to index amounts.

    * (4) If you *hold a *car that is also held by one or more other entities, subsection (1) applies to the *cost of the car despite section 4035. Then section 4035 applies to the cost of the car as reduced under subsection (1).

##### 40235  Adjustment: National Disability Insurance Scheme costs

    * The *cost of a *depreciating asset does not include an amount to the extent that section 2697 prevents the amount from being deducted (even if some other provision also prevents it being deducted).

         * Note: Section 2697 denies deductions for National Disability Insurance Scheme expenditure.

##### Subdivision 40D--Balancing adjustments

##### Guide to Subdivision 40D

##### 40280  What this Subdivision is about

    * You may have to make an adjustment to your taxable income if you stop holding a depreciating asset.

    * The adjustment is generally based on the difference between the actual value of the asset when you stop holding it and its adjustable value.

##### Operative provisions

##### 40285  Balancing adjustments

    * (1) An amount is included in your assessable income if:

     * (a) a *balancing adjustment event occurs for a *depreciating asset you *held and:

       * (i) whose decline in value you worked out under Subdivision 40B; or

       * (ii) whose decline in value you would have worked out under that Subdivision if you had used the asset; and

     * (b) the asset's *termination value is more than its *adjustable value just before the event occurred.

    * The amount included is the difference between those amounts, and it is included for the income year in which the balancing adjustment event occurred.

         * Note 1: The most common balancing adjustment event is where you sell the depreciating asset.

         * Note 2: There is a different calculation if you had used different car expense methods for a car: see section 40370.

         * Note 3: There is a modification to the calculation in the case of misappropriation by your employee or agent: see section 2547.

    * (2) You can deduct an amount if:

     * (a) a *balancing adjustment event occurs for a *depreciating asset you *held and:

       * (i) whose decline in value you worked out under Subdivision 40B; or

       * (ii) whose decline in value you would have worked out under that Subdivision if you had used the asset; and

     * (b) the asset's *termination value is less than its *adjustable value just before the event occurred.

    * The amount you can deduct is the difference between those amounts, and you can deduct it for the income year in which the balancing adjustment event occurred.

         * Note 1: There is a different calculation if you had used different car expense methods for a car: see section 40370.

         * Note 2: The timing of a deduction allowed under this subsection is determined under Subdivision 170D where that Subdivision applies to the balancing adjustment event.

         * Note 3: There is a modification to the calculation in the case of misappropriation by your employee or agent: see section 2547.

    * (3) The *adjustable value of a *depreciating asset you *hold after this section applies to it is then zero.

    * (4) However, subsection (3) does not apply to a *depreciating asset for which you have a *cost under item 3, 4 or 14 of the table in subsection 40180(2). Instead, the asset's *opening adjustable value for the income year (the **_later year_**) after the one in which the *balancing adjustment event occurred is that cost plus any amounts included in the second element of that cost after the event occurred and before the start of the later year.

         * Note: Those items deal with a case where a balancing adjustment event happens even though you still hold the asset in question.

    * (5) Despite subsection (1), an amount included in your assessable income under that subsection is included for the second income year after the income year in which the *balancing adjustment event occurs if:

     * (a) the *depreciating asset is a vessel; and

     * (b) you have a certificate for the vessel under Part 2 of the _Shipping Reform (Tax Incentives) Act 2012_ that:

       * (i) applies to the day that the balancing adjustment event occurs; and

       * (ii) is not a *shipping exempt income certificate.

         * Note: An amount will not be included in your assessable income in relation to the balancing adjustment event if you choose rollover relief under section 40362.

##### 40290  Reduction for nontaxable use

    * (1) You must reduce the amount (the **_balancing adjustment amount_**) included in your assessable income, or the amount you can deduct, under section 40285 for a *depreciating asset if your deductions for the asset have been reduced under section 4025.

    * (2) The reduction is:

    * where: 

    * **_sum of reductions_** is the sum of:

     * (a) the reductions in your deductions for the asset under section 4025; and

     * (b) if there has been rollover relief for the asset under section 40340--the reductions in deductions for the asset for the transferor or an earlier successive transferor under section 4025; and

     * (c) if you *hold the asset as the *legal personal representative of an individual--the reductions in deductions for the asset for the individual under section 4025.

    * **_total decline_** is the sum of:

     * (a) the decline in value of the *depreciating asset since you started to *hold it; and

     * (b) if there has been rollover relief for the asset under section 40340--the decline in value of the asset for the transferor or an earlier successive transferor; and

     * (c) if you *hold the asset as the *legal personal representative of an individual--the decline in value of the asset for the individual.

    * (3) You must further reduce the amount included in your assessable income, or the amount you can deduct, under section 40285 for a *depreciating asset (the **_current asset_**) if:

     * (a) the asset's *cost (for you) was worked out under section 40205 (Cost of a split depreciating asset) or 40210 (Cost of merged depreciating assets); and

     * (b) you used the depreciating asset from which the current asset was split, or a depreciating asset that was merged into the current asset, or had it *installed ready for use, for a purpose other than a *taxable purpose.

    * (4) The further reduction is such amount as is reasonable having regard to the extent of the use referred to in paragraph (3)(b).

    *  Exception: mining, quarrying or prospecting information

    * (5) This section does not apply to *mining, quarrying or prospecting information.

##### 40292  Adjustments--assets used for both general tax purposes and R&D activities

    * (1) This section applies if:

     * (a) a *balancing adjustment event happens in an income year (the **_event year_**) for an asset you *held and for which:

       * (i) you can deduct, for an income year, an amount under section 4025, as that section applies apart from Division 355 and former section 73BC of the _Income Tax Assessment Act 1936_; or

       * (ii) you could have deducted, for an income year, an amount as described in subparagraph (i) if you had used the asset; and

     * (b) you are entitled under section 355100 to *tax offsets for one or more income years for deductions (the **_R&D deductions_**) under section 355305 for the asset.

         * Note: This section applies in a modified way if you have deductions for the asset under former section 73BA or 73BH of the _Income Tax Assessment Act 1936_ (see section 40292 of the _Income Tax (Transitional Provisions) Act 1997_).

    * Section 40290 to be applied as if use for conducting R&D activities were use for a taxable purpose

    * (2) In applying section 40290 (including references in that section to the reduction of deductions under section 4025) in relation to the asset, assume that using the asset for a *taxable purpose includes using it for the purpose of conducting the *R&D activities to which the R&D deductions relate.

    * Increase in amounts deductible under section 40285

    * (3) If you are entitled under section 355100 to a *tax offset for the event year in respect of deductions under Division 355 totalling at least $20,000, any amount (the **_section 40285 amount_**) you can deduct for the asset under section 40285 (after applying subsection (2) of this section) for the event year is increased by:

     * (a) if your *aggregated turnover for the event year is less than $20 million--1/2 of the amount worked out under subsection (5) of this section; and

     * (b) otherwise--1/3 of the amount worked out under subsection (5) of this section.

    * Increase in amounts assessable under section 40285

    * (4) Any amount (the **_section 40285 amount_**) that is included in your assessable income for the asset under section 40285 (after applying subsection (2) of this section) for the event year is increased by 1/3 of the amount worked out under subsection (5) of this section.

    * Component of any increase in amounts deductible or assessable

    * (5) The amount is worked out as follows:

    * where: 

    * **_adjusted section 40285 amount_** means:

     * (a) if the section 40285 amount is a deduction--the amount of the deduction; or

     * (b) if the section 40285 amount is an amount included in your assessable income--so much of the section 40285 amount as does not exceed the total decline in value.

    * **_total decline in value _**means the *cost of the asset less its *adjustable value.

##### 40293  Adjustments--partnership assets used for both general tax purposes and R&D activities

    * (1) This section applies to an *R&D partnership if:

     * (a) a *balancing adjustment event happens in an income year (the **_event year_**) for a *depreciating asset *held by the R&D partnership and for which:

       * (i) the R&D partnership can deduct, for an income year, an amount under section 4025, as that section applies apart from Division 355 and former section 73BC of the _Income Tax Assessment Act 1936_; or

       * (ii) the R&D partnership could have deducted, for an income year, an amount as described in subparagraph (i) if it had used the asset; and

     * (b) one or more partners of the R&D partnership are entitled under section 355100 to *tax offsets for one or more income years for deductions (the **_R&D deductions_**) under section 355520 for the asset.

         * Note: This section applies in a modified way if the partners have deductions for the asset under former section 73BA or 73BH of the _Income Tax Assessment Act 1936_ (see section 40293 of the _Income Tax (Transitional Provisions) Act 1997_).

    * Section 40290 to be applied as if use for conducting R&D activities were use for a taxable purpose

    * (2) In applying section 40290 (including references in that section to the reduction of deductions under section 4025) in relation to the asset, assume that using the asset for a *taxable purpose includes using it for the purpose of conducting the *R&D activities to which the R&D deductions relate.

    * Increase in amounts deductible or assessable under section 40285

    * (3) Any amount (the **_section 40285 amount_**):

     * (a) that the *R&D partnership can deduct for the asset under section 40285 (after applying subsection (2) of this section) for the event year; or

     * (b) that is included in the R&D partnership's assessable income for the asset under section 40285 (after applying subsection (2) of this section) for the event year;

    * is increased by 1/3 of the following amount:

    * where: 

    * **_adjusted section 40285 amount_** means:

     * (a) if the section 40285 amount is a deduction--the amount of the deduction; or

     * (b) if the section 40285 amount is an amount included in the *R&D partnership's assessable income--so much of the section 40285 amount as does not exceed the total decline in value.

    * **_total decline in value _**means the *cost of the asset less its *adjustable value.

##### 40295  Meaning of balancing adjustment event

    * (1) A **_balancing adjustment event_** occurs for a *depreciating asset if:

     * (a) you stop *holding the asset; or

     * (b) you stop using it, or having it *installed ready for use, for any purpose and you expect never to use it, or have it installed ready for use, again; or

     * (c) you have not used it and:

       * (i) if you have had it installed ready for use--you stop having it so installed; and

       * (ii) you decide never to use it.

         * Note: A balancing adjustment event occurs under paragraph 40295(1)(a) when you start holding a depreciating asset as trading stock.

    * (1A) A **_balancing adjustment event_** occurs for a *depreciating asset you *hold that is a *mining, quarrying or prospecting right, or *mining, quarrying or prospecting information, if:

     * (a) the only reason that subsection 4080(1) does not apply to the right or information is that the right or information does not meet the requirements of paragraph 4080(1)(d) or (e); and

     * (b) you have neither budgeted nor planned for further expenditure that:

       * (i) will relate to the tenement to which the right or information relates; and

       * (ii) will exceed the minimum expenditure required to maintain the tenement; and

     * (c) you choose to apply this subsection to the right or information.

    * (1B) A **_balancing adjustment event_** occurs for a *depreciating asset you *hold that is a *mining, quarrying or prospecting right, or *mining, quarrying or prospecting information, if:

     * (a) since the last time you commenced to hold the right or information, a *balancing adjustment event occurred, because of subsection (1A), to the right or information; and

     * (b) paragraph (1A)(b) no longer applies.

    * (2) A **_balancing adjustment event_** occurs for a *depreciating asset if:

     * (a) for any reason, a change occurs in the *holding of, or in the interests of entities in, the asset; and

     * (b) the entity or one of the entities that had an interest in the asset before the change has an interest in it after the change; and

     * (c) the asset was a partnership asset before the change or becomes one as a result of the change.

    * (3) However, a **_balancing adjustment event_** does not occur for a *depreciating asset merely because you split it into 2 or more depreciating assets or you merge it with one or more other depreciating assets.

         * Note: A balancing adjustment event will occur if you stop holding part of a depreciating asset.

##### 40300  Meaning of termination value

    * (1) The **_termination value_** of a *depreciating asset is worked out as at the time when the *balancing adjustment event occurs. It is:

     * (a) if an item in the table in subsection (2) applies--the amount specified in that item; or

     * (b) otherwise--the amount you are taken to have received under section 40305 for the asset.

         * Note: Section 230505 provides special rules for working out the amount of consideration for an asset if the asset is a Division 230 financial arrangement or a Division 230 financial arrangement is involved in that consideration.

    * (2) If more than one item applies, use the value under the last applicable item.

    * (3) The **_termination value_** of a *depreciating asset does not include an amount that is included in assessable income as *ordinary income under section 65 or as *statutory income under section 610 (except an amount that is statutory income under this Division).

         * Note: Termination value may be adjusted under Subdivision 27B so that any GST consequences are accounted for.

##### 40305  Amount you are taken to have received under a balancing adjustment event

    * (1) This Division applies to you as if you had received, under a *balancing adjustment event, the greater of these amounts:

     * (a) the sum of the amounts you have deducted or can deduct, or has been or will be taken into account in working out an amount you can deduct because of the balancing adjustment event and any amount by which the amount so deductible was reduced because of a case described in the table in this subsection; and

     * (b) the sum of the applicable amounts set out in that table:

         * Note 1: Item 1 includes not only amounts actually received but also amounts taken to have been received. Examples include the price of the notional sale made when a depreciating asset is converted to trading stock under section 7030, the consideration for an asset held under a hire purchase arrangement under section 24025 and a lessee's deemed consideration when a luxury car lease ends under subsection 24290(3).

         * Note 2: Section 230505 provides special rules for working out the amount of consideration for an asset if the asset is a Division 230 financial arrangement or a Division 230 financial arrangement is involved in that consideration.

    * (2) In applying the table in subsection (1) to a right you have to receive an amount or a *noncash benefit, don't count any part of the right that has already been satisfied.

##### 40310  Apportionment of termination value

    * If you receive an amount for 2 or more things that include a *balancing adjustment event occurring for a *depreciating asset, you take into account as its *termination value only that part of what you received that is reasonably attributable to the asset.

##### 40320  Car to which section 40225 applies

    * You must increase the *termination value of a *car the *cost of which was increased under section 40225 by the discount portion for the car referred to in that section.

##### 40325  Adjustment: car limit

    * The **_termination value_** of a *car the *cost of which was worked out by applying section 40230 (Car limit) is the amount worked out under subsection 40300(1) multiplied by the fraction:

    * where: 

    * **_CL_** is the *car limit for the *car for the *financial year in which you first used it for any purpose.

##### 40335  Deduction for inhouse software where you will never use it

    * (1) You can deduct expenditure you incurred on *inhouse software if:

     * (a) you incurred the expenditure with the intention of using the software for a *taxable purpose; and

     * (b) the expenditure relates to a unit of software that you have not used or had *installed ready for use; and

     * (c) the expenditure is not allocated to a software development pool (see Subdivision 40E); and

     * (d) in the *current year, you have decided that you will never use the software, or have it installed ready for use.

    * (2) The amount that you can deduct in the *current year is:

     * (a) the total of your expenditure on the *inhouse software in the current year and any previous income year; _less_

     * _	(b)	any amount of consideration you *derive in relation to the software or any part of it (but no more than the total in paragraph (a));

    * but only to the extent that, when you incurred the expenditure, you intended to use the software, or have it *installed ready for use, for a *taxable purpose.

         * Example: Shannon has abandoned a software project that she was working on. She could not deduct expenditure on the project for the current year or any previous income year under any other provision. Shannon can deduct it under this section, to the extent that she intended to use it, or have it installed ready for use, for a taxable purpose.

         * Note: If an amount of the expenditure is recouped, the amount may be included in her assessable income: see Subdivision 20A.

##### 40340  Rollover relief

    * Automatic rollover relief

    * (1) There is rollover relief if:

     * (a) there is a *balancing adjustment event because an entity (the **_transferor_**) disposes of a *depreciating asset in an income year to another entity (the **_transferee_**); and

     * (b) the disposal involves a *CGT event; and

     * (c) the conditions in an item in this table are satisfied.

         * Note 1: Section 40345 sets out what the relief is.

         * Note 2: This Act also applies as if there were rollover relief under this subsection in the circumstances set out in section 62030 (which is about a body incorporated under one law ceasing to exist and disposing of its assets to a company incorporated under another law that has not significantly different ownership).

    * (2) In applying an item in the table in subsection (1), disregard the following so far as they relate to the *depreciating asset you disposed of:

     * (a) an exemption in Division 118 (which contains the general exemptions from CGT); and

     * (b) subsection 12225(3) (which excludes certain assets from some kinds of CGT rollover); and

     * (c) subsection 124870(5) (which excludes certain assets from rollover relief under Subdivision 124N).

    * Choosing rollover relief

    * (3) There is also rollover relief if:

     * (a) there is a *balancing adjustment event for a *depreciating asset because of subsection 40295(2) (about a change in the holding of, or in interests in, the asset); and

     * (b) the entity or entities that had an interest in the asset before the change (also the **_transferor_**) and the entity or entities that have an interest in the asset after the change (also the **_transferee_**) jointly choose the rollover relief.

         * Example: The change could be a variation in the constitution of a partnership or in the interests of the partners.

         * Note 1: Section 40345 sets out what the relief is.

         * Note 2: Subdivision 328D sets out what the relief is for small business entities that calculate deductions for their depreciating assets under that Subdivision.

    * (4) The choice must:

     * (a) be in writing; and

     * (b) contain enough information about the transferor's holding of the property for the transferee to work out how this Division or Subdivision 328D applies to the transferee's holding of the *depreciating asset; and

     * (c) be made within 6 months after the end of the transferee's income year in which the *balancing adjustment event occurred, or within a longer period allowed by the Commissioner.

    * (5) If you die before the end of the time allowed for jointly choosing rollover relief, the trustee of your estate may be a party to the choice.

    * (6) The transferor must keep the choice or a copy of it for 5 years after the *balancing adjustment event occurred.

       * Penalty: 30 penalty units.

    * (7) The transferee must keep the choice or a copy of it until the end of 5 years after the next *balancing adjustment event occurs for the *depreciating asset.

       * Penalty: 30 penalty units.

    *  Exception: Subdivision 170D applies

    * (8) There can be no rollover relief if Subdivision 170D (about transactions by a company that is a member of a linked group) applies to the disposal of the *depreciating asset or the change in interests in it.

##### 40345  What the rollover relief is

    * (1) Section 40285 does not apply to the *balancing adjustment event for the transferor.

    * (2) The transferee can deduct the decline in value of the *depreciating asset using the same method and *effective life (or *remaining effective life if that method is the *prime cost method) that the transferor was using.

##### 40350  Additional consequences

    * (1) For the purposes of Division 45:

     * (a) if the transferor, or a partnership of which the transferor was a member, leased the *depreciating asset to another entity for most of the time that the transferor or partnership *held the asset, the transferee is taken also to have done so; and

     * (b) if the transferor, or a partnership of which the transferor was a member, leased the asset to another entity for a period on or after 22 February 1999, the transferee is taken also to have done so; and

     * (c) if the main *business of the transferor, or a partnership of which the transferor was a member, was to lease assets, the main business of the transferee is taken also to have been to lease assets.

    * (2) However, subsection (1) does not apply to rollover relief under subsection 40340(3) if the sum of the amounts specified in paragraph 455(1)(e) or 4510(1)(f), or subsection 455(4) or 4510(4), is at least equal to the *market value of the *plant or interest concerned.

##### 40360  Notice to allow transferee to work out how this Division applies

    * (1) This section applies if there is rollover relief because of subsection 40340(1).

    * (2) The transferor must give the transferee a notice containing enough information about the transferor's *holding of the property for the transferee to work out how this Division applies to the transferee's holding of the *depreciating asset.

    * (3) The transferor must give the notice within 6 months after the end of the transferee's income year in which the *balancing adjustment event occurred, or within a longer period allowed by the Commissioner.

    * (4) The transferee must keep the notice until the end of 5 years after the earlier of these events:

     * (a) the transferee disposes of the property;

     * (b) the property is lost or destroyed.

       * Penalty: 30 penalty units.

##### 40362  Rollover relief for holders of vessels covered by certificates under the Shipping Reform (Tax Incentives) Act 2012

    * Circumstances giving rise to rollover relief

    * (1) There is rollover relief if:

     * (a) there is a *balancing adjustment event under section 40295 because you cease to *hold a *depreciating asset that is a vessel (the **_original vessel_**); and

     * (b) on the day that the balancing adjustment event occurs, you have a certificate for the vessel under Part 2 of the _Shipping Reform (Tax Incentives) Act 2012_ that:

       * (i) applies to that day; and

       * (ii) is not a *shipping exempt income certificate; and

     * (c) there is no rollover relief under section 40340 relating to the original vessel; and

     * (d) on the day occurring 2 years after the day you cease to hold the original vessel, you are the holder of another depreciating asset that is a vessel (the **_other vessel_**):

       * (i) for which you choose to apply rollover relief in relation to the original vessel; and

       * (ii) for which you have a certificate under Part 2 of the _Shipping Reform (Tax Incentives) Act 2012_ (other than a shipping exempt income certificate) that applies to the day of that choice; and

     * (e) you became the holder of the other vessel during the period starting 1 year before the day you cease to hold the original vessel and ending 2 years after that day.

    * Choosing to apply rollover relief

    * (2) The choice must:

     * (a) be in writing; and

     * (b) be made within 6 months after the end of the second income year after the income year in which the *balancing adjustment event occurs, or within a longer period allowed by the Commissioner.

    * The effect of rollover relief

    * (3) If there is rollover relief under this section:

     * (a) subsection 40285(1) does not apply to the *balancing adjustment event in relation to the original vessel; and

     * (b) an amount is included in your assessable income if the original vessel's *termination value exceeds the sum of:

       * (i) the original vessel's *adjustable value just before the balancing adjustment event occurred; and

       * (ii) the *cost of the other vessel (disregarding paragraph (3)(c)); and

     * (c) for the purpose of applying this Act to the other vessel, its cost is reduced (but not below zero) by the difference between:

       * (i) the original vessel's termination value; and

       * (ii) the original vessel's adjustable value just before the balancing adjustment event occurred.

    * (4) The amount included in your assessable income under paragraph (3)(b) is the amount of the excess mentioned in that paragraph. It is included in the second income year after the income year in which the *balancing adjustment event occurs.

##### 40365  Involuntary disposals

    * (1) You may exclude some or all of an amount that has been included in your assessable income for a *depreciating asset (the **_original asset_**) as a result of a *balancing adjustment event to the extent that you choose to treat it as an amount to be applied under subsection (5) for one or more replacement assets.

    * (2) You can only make this choice if you stop *holding the asset because:

     * (a) the original asset is lost or destroyed; or

     * (b) the original asset is compulsorily acquired by an *Australian government agency; or

     * (c) the original asset is acquired by an entity (other than an Australian government agency or a *foreign government agency) under a power of compulsory acquisition conferred by a law covered under subsection (2A); or

     * (d) you dispose of the original asset to an entity (other than a foreign government agency) in circumstances meeting all of these conditions:

       * (i) the disposal takes place after a notice was served on you by or on behalf of the entity;

       * (ii) the notice invited you to negotiate with the entity with a view to the entity acquiring the asset by agreement;

       * (iii) the notice informed you that if the negotiations were unsuccessful, the asset would be compulsorily acquired by the entity;

       * (iv) the compulsory acquisition would have been under a power of compulsory acquisition conferred by a law covered under subsection (2A); or

     * (e) you dispose of land onto which the original asset was fixed to an entity (other than a foreign government agency) in circumstances meeting all of these conditions:

       * (i) a mining lease was compulsorily granted over the land;

       * (ii) the lease significantly affected your use of the land;

       * (iii) the lease was in force just before the disposal;

       * (iv) the entity to which you dispose of the land was the lessee under the lease; or

     * (f) you dispose of land onto which the original asset was fixed to an entity (other than a foreign government agency) in circumstances meeting all of these conditions:

       * (i) a mining lease would have been compulsorily granted over the land if you had not disposed of it;

       * (ii) that lease would have significantly affected your use of the land;

       * (iii) the entity to which you dispose of the land would have been the lessee under the lease.

    * (2A) A law is covered under this subsection if it is:

     * (a) an *Australian law (other than Chapter 6A of the _Corporations Act 2001_); or

     * (b) a *foreign law (other than a foreign law corresponding to Chapter 6A of the _Corporations Act 2001_).

    * (3) You can only make this choice for a replacement asset if you incur the expenditure on the replacement asset, or you start to *hold it:

     * (a) no earlier than one year, or within a further period the Commissioner allows, before the *balancing adjustment event occurred; and

     * (b) no later than one year, or within a further period the Commissioner allows, after the end of the income year in which the balancing adjustment event occurred.

    * (4) You can only make this choice for a replacement asset if:

     * (a) at the end of the income year in which you incurred the expenditure on the asset, or you started to *hold it, you used it, or had it *installed ready for use, wholly for a *taxable purpose; and

     * (b) you can deduct an amount for it.

    * (5) For the purposes of applying this Act to the replacement asset:

     * (a) its *cost is reduced by the amount covered by the choice for the income year in which the asset's *start time occurs; and

     * (b) if the income year is later than the one in which the asset's *start time occurs--the sum of its *opening adjustable value for that later year and any amount included in the second element of the asset's cost for that later year is reduced by the amount covered by the choice.

    * (6) If you are making the choice for 2 or more replacement assets, you apportion the amount covered by the choice between those items in proportion to their *cost.

##### 40370  Balancing adjustments where there has been use of different car expense methods

    * (1) An amount is included in your assessable income or you can deduct an amount under this section instead of section 40285 if:

     * (a) a *balancing adjustment event occurs for a *car you *held; and

     * (b) you have deducted or can deduct an amount for the decline in value of the car for an income year under this Division; and

     * (c) you chose:

       * (i) the "cents per kilometre" method in Subdivision 28C; or

       * (ii) the "12% of original value" method in Subdivision 28D;

     * for deducting your car expenses for the car for one or more other income years.

         * Note 1: This means if you have only used the "log book" method or the "onethird of actual expenses" method since you began using the car, you calculate the assessable amount or deductible amount under section 40285.

         * Note 2: Also, if you have only used the "cents per kilometre" method or the "12% of original value" method since you began using the car, no amount is assessable or deductible under this section or section 40285.

    * (2) Work out the amount you include in your assessable income or the amount you can deduct in this way:

Method statement

       * Step 1.	Subtract the *car's *adjustable value just before the *balancing adjustment event occurred from the car's *termination value.

       * Step 2.	Reduce the step 1 amount by the part of the *car's decline in value that is attributable to your using the car, or having it *installed ready for use, for purposes other than *taxable purposes. You do this by applying the formula in subsection 40290(2).

       * Step 3.	Multiply the step 2 amount by the total number of days for which you deducted the decline in value of the *car under this Division.

       * Step 4.	Divide the step 3 amount by the total number of days you *held the *car.

       * Step 5.	The step 4 amount is a deduction if it is negative or it is included in your assessable income if it is positive.

    * (3) In working out the *adjustable value for the income years for which you chose the "cents per kilometre method" or the "12% of original value" method, you are to assume the decline in value was calculated under this Division on the same basis as those income years when those methods did not apply.

    * (4) In working out the reduction in step 2 for the income years for which you chose the "cents per kilometre method" or the "12% of original value" method, you must assume that:

     * (a) you had not chosen either of those methods for the *car; and

     * (b) Division 28 (car expenses) had not applied to the car; and

     * (c) you used the car for *taxable purposes:

       * (i) to the extent of 20% if you used the "cents per kilometre" method; or

       * (ii) to the extent of onethird if you used the "12% of original value" method.

##### Subdivision 40E--Lowvalue and software development pools

##### Operative provisions

##### 40425  Allocating assets to a lowvalue pool

    * (1) You may choose to allocate a *low cost asset you *hold to a lowvalue pool for the income year in which you start to use it, or have it *installed ready for use, for a *taxable purpose.

    * (2) A **_lowcost asset_** is a *depreciating asset (except a *horticultural plant) whose *cost as at the end of the income year in which you start to use it, or have it *installed ready for use, for a *taxable purpose is less than $1,000.

    * (3) You may also choose to allocate a *lowvalue asset to a lowvalue pool.

    * (4) You cannot allocate a *depreciating asset to a lowvalue pool if:

     * (a) its *cost does not exceed $300; and

     * (b) you use the asset predominantly for the *purpose of producing assessable income that is not income from carrying on a *business; and

     * (c) the asset is not part of a set of assets that you started to hold in that income year where the total cost of the set of assets exceeds $300; and

     * (d) the total cost of the asset and any other identical, or substantially identical, asset that you start to hold in that income year does not exceed $300.

    * (5) A **_lowvalue asset_** is a *depreciating asset, except a *horticultural plant, you *hold:

     * (a) if you have deducted or can deduct amounts for it under this Division for a previous income year--for which you used the *diminishing value method; and

     * (b) that has an *opening adjustable value for the current year of less than $1,000 (worked out using the diminishing value method); and

     * (c) that is not a *lowcost asset.

    * (6) A *depreciating asset:

     * (a) to which Division 58 (about assets previously owned by an exempt entity) applied for an entity sale situation; and

     * (b) for which you used the *diminishing value method; and

     * (c) whose *adjustable value as at the end of the income year before the *current year is less than $1,000;

    * is also a **_lowvalue asset_**.

    *  Exception: small business entities

    * (7) You cannot allocate a *depreciating asset to a lowvalue pool if you deduct amounts for it under Subdivision 328D (about capital allowances for small business entities).

    *  Exception: R&D

    * (8) You cannot allocate a *depreciating asset to a lowvalue pool if you are entitled under section 355100 to a *tax offset for a deduction under section 355305 for the asset for an income year starting before, or at the same time as, the allocation has effect.

         * Note: A similar rule applies if you deducted or could have deducted amounts under former 73BA of the _Income Tax Assessment Act 1936_ (see section 40430 of the _Income Tax (Transitional Provisions) Act 1997_).

##### 40430  Rules for assets in lowvalue pools

    * (1) Once you have made a choice to allocate a *lowcost asset to a lowvalue pool for an income year, you must allocate all lowcost assets you start to *hold in that income year or a later one to the pool.

         * Note 1: This rule does not apply to lowvalue assets.

         * Note 2: If you are a small business entity for the income year and you calculate your deductions for your depreciating assets under Subdivision 328D, you must deduct amounts for your depreciating assets under that Subdivision unless deductions for particular assets are specifically excluded by that Subdivision.

    * (2) Once you allocate any *depreciating asset to a lowvalue pool, it must remain in the pool.

##### 40435  Private or exempt use of assets

    * When you allocate a *depreciating asset to a lowvalue pool, you must make a reasonable estimate of the percentage (the **_taxable use percentage_**) of your use of the asset (including any past use) that will be for a *taxable purpose over:

     * (a) for a *lowcost asset--its *effective life; or

     * (b) for a *lowvalue asset--any period of its effective life that is yet to elapse at the start of the income year for which you allocate it to the pool.

##### 40440  How you work out the decline in value of assets in lowvalue pools

    * (1) You work out the decline in value of *depreciating assets in a lowvalue pool for an income year in this way:

       * Step 1.	Work out the amount obtained by taking 183/4% of the taxable use percentage of the *cost of each *lowcost asset you allocated to the pool for that year. Add those amounts.

       * Step 2.	Add to the step 1 amount 183/4% of the taxable use percentage of any amounts included in the second element of the *cost for that year of:

         * (a) assets allocated to the pool for an earlier income year; and

         * (b) *lowvalue assets allocated to the pool for the *current year.

       * Step 3.	Add to the step 2 amount 371/2% of the sum of:

         * (a) the *closing pool balance for the previous income year; and

         * (b) the taxable use percentage of the *opening adjustable values of *lowvalue assets, at the start of the income year, that you allocated to the pool for that year.

       * Step 4.	The result is the decline in value of the *depreciating assets in the pool.

    * (2) The **_closing pool balance_** of a lowvalue pool for an income year is the sum of:

     * (a) the *closing pool balance of the pool for the previous income year; and

     * (b) the taxable use percentage of the *costs of *lowcost assets you allocated to the pool for that year; and

     * (c) the taxable use percentage of the *opening adjustable values of any *lowvalue assets you allocated to the pool for that year as at the start of that year; and

     * (d) the taxable use percentage of any amounts included in the second element of the cost for the income year of:

       * (i) assets allocated to the pool for an earlier income year; and

       * (ii) lowvalue assets allocated to the pool for the *current year;

    * less the decline in value of the *depreciating assets in the pool worked out under subsection (1).

         * Note: The closing pool balance may be reduced under section 40445 if a balancing adjustment event happens.

##### 40445  Balancing adjustment events

    * (1) If a *balancing adjustment event happens to a *depreciating asset in a lowvalue pool in an income year, the *closing pool balance for that year is reduced (but not below zero) by the taxable use percentage of the asset's *termination value.

    * (2) If the sum of the *termination values, or the part of it, applicable under subsection (1) exceeds the *closing pool balance of the pool for that year, the excess is included in your assessable income.

##### 40450  Software development pools

    * (1) You may choose to allocate amounts of expenditure you incur on *inhouse software in an income year to a software development pool if it is expenditure on developing, or having another entity develop, computer software.

         * Note: You cannot allocate expenditure on inhouse software to a software development pool if it is expenditure on acquiring computer software or a right to use computer software.

    * (2) Once you choose to create a software development pool for an income year, any amounts of the kind referred to in subsection (1) you incur after the pool is created (whether in that income year or a later one) must be allocated to a software development pool.

    * (3) However, an amount of expenditure on *inhouse software can only be allocated to a software development pool if you intend to use the software solely for a *taxable purpose.

    * (4) You must create a separate software development pool for each income year for which you incur amounts of the kind referred to in subsection (1).

##### 40455  How to work out your deduction

    * For all the expenditure on *inhouse software in a software development pool that was incurred in a particular income year (**_Year 1_**), you get deductions in successive income years as follows:

##### 40460  Your assessable income includes consideration for pooled software

    * (1) If expenditure on *inhouse software is (or was) in your software development pool, your assessable income includes any amount you *derive as consideration in relation to the software.

    * (2) However, subsection (1) does not apply if subsection 40340(3) (rollover relief) applies to the change.

##### Operative provisions

##### 40515  Water facilities, horticultural plants, fodder storage assets and fencing assets

    * (1) You can deduct an amount equal to the decline in value for an income year (as worked out under this Subdivision) of a *depreciating asset that is one of these:

     * (a) a *water facility;

     * (b) a *horticultural plant;

     * (c) a *fodder storage asset;

     * (d) a *fencing asset.

         * Note 1: Sections 40540 and 40545 show you how to work out the decline.

         * Note 2: Generally, only one taxpayer can deduct amounts for a depreciating asset. However, if you and another taxpayer jointly hold the asset, each of you deduct amounts for it: see section 4035.

    * Conditions

    * (2) However, the applicable condition in section 40525 must be satisfied for the *depreciating asset.

    * Limit on deduction

    * (3) You cannot deduct more in total than:

     * (a) for a *water facility--the amount of capital expenditure (disregarding expenditure that you cannot deduct because of section 26100 (about water infrastructure improvement expenditure)) incurred on the facility; or

     * (b) for a *horticultural plant--the amount of capital expenditure incurred on the plant; or

     * (c) for a *fodder storage asset--the amount of capital expenditure incurred on the asset; or

     * (d) for a *fencing asset--the amount of capital expenditure incurred on the asset.

    *  Reduction of deduction: water facilities, fodder storage assets and fencing assets

    * (4) You must reduce your deduction for a *water facility, *fodder storage asset or *fencing asset for an income year by the part of the decline in value of the facility or asset that is attributable to the period (if any) in the income year when it was:

     * (a) not wholly used in carrying on a *primary production business on land in Australia; or

     * (b) not wholly used for a *taxable purpose.

    * (5) Paragraph (4)(a) does not apply to a *water facility if the expenditure incurred on the construction, manufacture, installation or acquisition of the water facility was incurred by an *irrigation water provider.

    * Meaning of **irrigation water provider**

    * (4) To avoid doubt, for the purposes of this section, you do not enter into a contract under which you *hold an asset merely because you acquire an option to enter into such a contract.

##### 4130  First use time

    * The **_first use time _**for the amount is:

     * (a) if the amount is included in the first element of the asset's *cost--the time at which you start to use the asset, or have it *installed ready for use; or

     * (b) if the amount is included in the second element of the asset's cost--the later of:

       * (i) the time at which it becomes included in that element under paragraph 40190(2)(a); or

       * (ii) the time mentioned in paragraph (a).

##### 4135  New investment threshold

     * (a) $1000 if you are a *small business entity during any of the following income years:

       * (i) the income year in which occurs the *investment commitment time for any *recognised new investment amount for the asset in relation to the relevant income year;

       * (ii) the income year in which occurs the *first use time for any such amount;

       * (iii) the relevant income year; or

##### Operative provisions

##### 4310  Deductions for capital works

    * (1) You can deduct an amount for capital works for an income year.

    * (2) You can only deduct the amount if:

     * (a) the capital works have a *construction expenditure area; and

     * (b) there is a *pool of construction expenditure for that area; and

     * (c) you use *your area in the income year in the way set out in Table 43140 (Current year use).

         * Note 1: The deduction is limited to capital works to which this Division applies, see section 4320.

         * Note 2: Amongst other things, the definition of **_your area _**ensures that only owners and certain lessees of capital works, and certain holders of quasiownership rights over land on which capital works are constructed, can deduct an amount under this Division.

##### 4315  Amount you can deduct

    * (1) The amount you can deduct is a portion of *your construction expenditure. However, it cannot exceed the amount of *undeducted construction expenditure for *your area.

         * Note: The limit in this subsection has 2 effects:

           *  	It ensures that not more than 100% of your construction expenditure can be deducted.

           *  	It imposes a time limit on the period over which your construction expenditure can be deducted. For capital works begun before 27 February 1992, that period will be 25 years if the rate of deduction is 4% or 40 years if the rate is 2.5%. For other capital works, the period will be 25 years or 40 years or some period between 25 and 40 years depending on their use. 

    * (2) Your deduction is calculated under section 43210 or 43215.

##### 4320  Capital works to which this Division applies

    * Buildings

    * (1) This Division applies to capital works being a building, or an extension, alteration or improvement to a building:

     * (a) begun in Australia after 21 August 1979; or

     * (b) begun outside Australia after 21 August 1990.

         * Note: Section 4380 explains when capital works begin.

    * Structural improvements

    * (2) This Division also applies to capital works (other than capital works referred to in subsection (1)) begun after 26 February 1992 that are structural improvements, or extensions, alterations or improvements to structural improvements, whether they are in or outside Australia.

    * (3) Some examples of structural improvements are:

     * (a) sealed roads, sealed driveways, sealed car parks, sealed airport runways, bridges, pipelines, lined road tunnels, retaining walls, fences, concrete or rock dams and artificial sports fields; and

     * (b) earthworks that are integral to the construction of a structural improvement (other than a structural improvement described in subsection (4)), for example, embankments, culverts and tunnels associated with a runway, road or railway.

    * (4) This Division does not apply to structural improvements being:

     * (a) earthworks that:

       * (i) are not integral to the installation or construction of a structure; and

       * (ii) are permanent (assuming they are maintained in reasonably good order and condition); and

       * (iii) can be economically maintained in reasonably good order and condition for an indefinite period;

     * for example, unlined channels, unlined basins, earth tanks and dirt tracks; or

     * (b) earthworks that merely create artificial landscapes, for example, grass golf course fairways and greens, gardens, and grass sports fields.

    * Environment protection earthworks

    * (5) This Division also applies to capital works being earthworks, or extensions, alterations or improvements to earthworks, if:

     * (a) they are constructed as a result of carrying out of *environmental protection activities; and

     * (b) they can be economically maintained in reasonably good order and condition for an indefinite period; and

     * (c) they are not integral to the construction of capital works; and

     * (d) the expenditure on the capital works was incurred after 18 August 1992.

         * Note: This subsection allows you to deduct an amount for some earthworks that are excluded by paragraph (4)(a) if the earthworks are constructed in carrying out an environmental protection activity.

##### 4325  Rate of deduction

    * (1) For capital works begun after 26 February 1992, there is a basic entitlement to a rate of 2.5% for parts used as described in Table 43140 (Current year use). The rate increases to 4% for parts used as described in Table 43145 (Use in the 4% manner).

    * (2) For capital works begun before 27 February 1992 and used as described in Table 43140, the rate is:

     * (a) 4% if the capital works were begun after 21 August 1984 and before 16 September 1987; or

     * (b) 2.5% in any other case.

         * Note: Section 4380 explains when capital works begin.

##### 4330  No deduction until construction is complete

    * You cannot deduct an amount for any period before the completion of construction of the capital works even though you used them, or part of them, before completion.

##### 4335  Requirement for registration under the Industry Research and Development Act

    * You may deduct an amount under this Division on the basis of using capital works for the purpose of conducting *R&D activities only if:

     * (a) you are registered under section 27A (registering R&D activities) of the _Industry Research and Development Act 1986_ for the R&D activities for an income year; or

     * (b) if you are an *R&D partnership--an *R&D entity, who was a partner of the R&D partnership at some time while the R&D activities were conducted, is registered under that section for the R&D activities for an income year.

         * Note 1: R&D activities must be conducted in connection with a business carried on for the purpose of producing assessable income, see section 43195.

         * Note 2: You may still deduct an amount under this Division if you were registered for the R&D activities under former section 39J (Registration of eligible companies) of the _Industry Research and Development Act 1986_ (see section 355200 of the _Income Tax (Transitional Provisions) Act 1997_).

##### 4340  Deduction for destruction of capital works

    * (1) You can deduct an amount if all or a part of *your area is destroyed in an income year and:

     * (a) you have been allowed, or can claim, a deduction under this Division, or former Division 10C or 10D of Part III of the _Income Tax Assessment Act 1936_, for your area; and

     * (b) there is an amount of *undeducted construction expenditure for your area; and

     * (c) you were using your area in the way that applies to it under Table 43140 (Current year use) immediately before the destruction or, if not, neither you nor any other entity used your area for any purpose since it was last used by you in that way.

    * (2) The deduction is allowable in the income year in which the destruction occurs, and is calculated under section 43250.

         * Note: The effect of this provision is to allow you to deduct an amount in the income year in which the capital works are destroyed for all of your construction expenditure that has not yet been deducted. However, you must reduce the deduction by any insurance and salvage receipts.

##### 4345  Certain antiavoidance provisions

    * These antiavoidance provisions: 

     * (a) section 51AD (Deductions not allowable in respect of property under certain leveraged arrangements) of the _Income Tax Assessment Act 1936_;

     * (b) Division 16D (Certain arrangements relating to the use of property) of Part III of that Act;

    * apply to your deductions under this Division for an asset as if you were the owner of the asset instead of any other person.

##### 4350  Links and signposts to other parts of the Act

    * Links

    * (1) No part of a *pool of construction expenditure can be a deduction, or taken into account in working out the amount of a deduction, under a provision of this Act other than this Division.

    * (2) No part of an amount incurred by an entity in acquiring capital works for which there is a *pool of construction expenditure can be a deduction, or taken into account in working out the amount of a deduction, under a provision of this Act other than this Division.

    * (3) You will be taken not to be the owner of any part of capital works that are the subject of a lease to which you have chosen to apply section 104115 (CGT event F2). The lessee or sublessee will be taken to be the owner of that part.

         * Note 1: Choosing to apply section 104115 results in the lease being treated for CGT purposes more like an outright disposal.

         * Note 2: See subsection 43180(3) for the effect of the rule in subsection (3) of this section on the need to own 10 apartments, units or flats in an apartment building.

    * Signposts

    * (6) There are special recordkeeping rules that apply to this Division in subsection 262A(4AJA) of the _Income Tax Assessment Act 1936_.

    * (7) Your deductions under this Division may be reduced if any of your commercial debts have been forgiven in the income year: see Subdivision 245E.

    * (8) Where you have had a deduction under this Division an amount may be included in your assessable income if the expenditure was financed by limited recourse debt that has terminated: see Division 243.

##### 4355  Antiavoidance--arrangement etc. with taxexempt entity

    * (1) You will not be allowed a deduction under this Division for an income year if the Commissioner is satisfied that:

     * (a) you entered into an *arrangement with:

       * (i) an entity to which section 505, 5010, 5015, 5025, 5030, 5040 or 5045 (dealing with *exempt income) applies; or

       * (ii) an STB (within the meaning of Division 1AB of Part III of the _Income Tax Assessment Act 1936_) whose *ordinary income and *statutory income is exempt from income tax;

     * under which you were to pay an amount, or transfer property, directly or indirectly, to the entity; and

     * (b) the amount of the payment or the value of the property is calculated by reference to the amount of a deduction allowable to you under this Division; and

     * (c) a purpose of the arrangement that is not a merely incidental purpose is to ensure that the benefit of the deduction would pass wholly or substantially to the entity, whether directly or indirectly.

    * (2) Subsection (1) applies to *arrangements entered into with an entity referred to in subparagraph (1)(a)(i) after 1 May 1980 that relate to deductions for *hotel buildings or *apartment buildings begun before 1 July 1997.

##### 4365  Explanatory material

    * Expenditure in respect of the construction of capital works is only eligible for a deduction under this Division if there is a construction expenditure area for the capital works. The area defined as the construction expenditure area may comprise the whole of the capital works or only part of them.

    * Whether there is a construction expenditure area for capital works and how it is identified depends on the following factors: 

      * the type of expenditure incurred;

      * the time when the capital works began;

      * the area of the capital works that is to be owned, leased or held by the entity that incurred the expenditure;

      * for capital works begun before 1 July 1997, the area of the capital works that was to be used in a particular manner.

    * A pool of construction expenditure is that part of an amount of construction expenditure that is attributable to a particular construction expenditure area.

##### Operative provisions

##### 4370  What is construction expenditure?

    * (1) **_Construction expenditure_** is capital expenditure incurred in respect of the construction of capital works.

    * (2) **_Construction expenditure_** does not include:

     * (a) expenditure on acquiring land; or

     * (b) expenditure on demolishing existing structures; or

     * (i) expenditure that you cannot deduct because of section 26100 (about water infrastructure improvement expenditure).

##### 4372  Meaning of forestry road, timber operation and timber mill building

    * (1) A **_forestry road_** is a road constructed primarily and principally for the purpose of providing access to an area to enable:

     * (a) trees to be planted or tended in the area; or

     * (b) timber felled in the area to be removed.

    * For this purpose, a road includes any bridge, culvert or similar work forming part of the road.

    * (2) A **_timber operation_** is:

     * (a) planting or tending trees for felling; or

     * (b) felling standing timber; or

     * (c) removing felled timber; or

     * (d) milling felled timber or processing it in another way.

    * (3) A **_timber mill building_** is a building:

     * (a) for use primarily and principally:

       * (i) in carrying on your *business of milling timber for a *taxable purpose; or

       * (ii) as residential accommodation for your employees engaged in connection with the business, or for their dependants; and

     * (b) located in a forest, and in or adjacent to the area where timber milled in the business is, or is to be, felled.

##### 4375  Construction expenditure area

    * (1) The **_construction expenditure area_** of capital works begun after 30 June 1997 is the part of the capital works on which the *construction expenditure was incurred that, at the time when it was incurred by an entity, was to be owned or leased by the entity or held by the entity under a *quasiownership right over land granted by an *exempt Australian government agency or an *exempt foreign government agency.

         * Note: Section 4380 explains when capital works begin.

    * (2) The **_construction expenditure area_** of capital works begun before 1 July 1997 is the part of the capital works on which the *construction expenditure was incurred that:

     * (a) at the time when it was incurred by an entity, was to be owned or leased by the entity or held by the entity under a *quasiownership right over land granted by an *exempt Australian government agency or an *exempt foreign government agency; and

     * (b) at the time of completion of construction, was to be used in the way described in Column 3 of Table 4390 (intended use at completion) for the time period when the capital works began as set out in Column 1.

    * (3) There is taken to be a **_construction expenditure area_** for capital works purchased by an entity from another entity if:

     * (a) the capital works would have had a construction expenditure area but for the fact that the other entity did not incur capital expenditure in constructing the capital works; and

     * (b) the other entity is not an *associate of the entity; and

     * (c) the other entity constructed the capital works on land that it owned or leased in the course of a business that included the construction and sale of capital works of that kind.

         * Note: Subsection (3) makes capital works purchased from a speculative builder eligible for deduction in the hands of the first and subsequent purchasers.

    * (4) The construction of the capital works must be complete before the *construction expenditure area is determined.

    * (5) Only one *construction expenditure area is created each time an entity constructs capital works.

         * Example: An entity undertakes the construction of a building. During the course of construction, the entity makes 3 progress payments to the builder. There is still only one construction expenditure area.

    * (6) A separate *construction expenditure area will be created each time an entity undertakes the construction of capital works.

         * Example: In the diagram below, area 1 relates to the original construction of a building which gives rise to one _construction expenditure area_. Area 2 is a subsequent extension of the same building which gives rise to another, while area 3 is a later renovation of the entire building which gives rise to another.

##### 4380  When capital works begin

    * Capital works are taken to begin when the first step in the construction phase starts. For example, the pouring of foundations or sinking of pilings for a building.

         * Note 1: Capital works begun after 15 September 1987 are taken to have begun before 16 September 1987 in certain circumstances. See section 43220.

         * Note 2: The time when capital works begin is relevant for determining whether the capital works qualify for deduction, the use to which those works must be put, the rate of deduction and the calculation mechanism used. However, the time when capital works begin does not limit what qualifies as construction expenditure.

##### 4385  Pools of construction expenditure

    * (1) A **_pool of construction expenditure_** is so much of the *construction expenditure incurred by an entity on capital works as is attributable to the *construction expenditure area.

    * (2) In applying subsection (1) in a case to which subsection 4375(3) (dealing with purchases from speculative builders) applies, assume that the expenditure incurred by the other entity was capital expenditure, but that the limitations in subsection 4370(2) (which sets out types of expenditure that are not *construction expenditure) still apply to the other entity's expenditure.

         * Note: The builder's profit margin does not form part of the construction expenditure of the purchaser.

##### 4390  Table of intended use at time of completion of construction

         * Note: There are special rules that explain or qualify the uses described in Column 3 of this Table. These rules are set out in Subdivision 43E (sections 43155 to 43195). For example, certain facilities that are not commonly provided in a hotel, motel or guest house in Australia are taken not to be used or for use to operate a hotel, motel or guest house, see subsection 43180(6).

##### 4395  Meaning of hotel building and apartment building

    * (1) A **_hotel building _**is:

     * (a) a building begun after 21 August 1979 and before 18 July 1985, or after 26 February 1992 and before 1 July 1997, that, at the time of completion of its construction, was intended to be used in the way referred to in Column 3 of Table 4390 (intended use at completion) for a hotel building; or

     * (b) a building begun after 30 June 1997 and that, in the income year, is used in the way referred to in Column 3 (time period 2) of Table 43145 (use in the 4% manner) for a hotel building.

    * (2) An **_apartment building_** is:

     * (a) a building begun after 21 August 1979 and before 18 July 1985, or after 26 February 1992 and before 1 July 1997, that, at the time of completion of its construction, was intended to be used in the way referred to in Column 3 of Table 4390 for an apartment building; or

     * (b) a building begun after 30 June 1997 and that, in the income year, is used in the way referred to in Column 3 (time period 2) of Table 43145 for an apartment building.

##### 43100  Certificates by Innovation Australia

    * A certificate by *Innovation Australia stating that activities carried on by or for an entity were or were not *core R&D activities or *supporting R&D activities is conclusive for the purposes of this Division.

         * Note: Core R&D activities and supporting R&D activities are kinds of R&D activities.

     * (b) has been continuously leased or held since the construction was completed by the lessee or holder who incurred the expenditure or an assignee of that lessee's lease or that holder's quasiownership right over land.

    * (3) **_Your construction expenditure_** is the portion of the *pool of construction expenditure that is attributable to your area.

##### 43125  Lessees' or right holders' pools can revert to owner

    * (1) An amount that relates to a *pool of construction expenditure that arises as a result of expenditure incurred by a lessee or a holder of a *quasiownership right over land:

     * (a) can only be deducted by a lessee or a holder of a quasiownership right over land who satisfies subsection 43120(1) or (2); and

     * (b) cannot be deducted by the owner of the capital works while there is a lessee or a holder of a quasiownership right over land who satisfies that subsection.

    * (2) The owner of the capital works may deduct an amount that relates to that pool if there is no longer a lessee or a holder of a *quasiownership right over land who satisfies subsection 43120(1) or (2).

##### 43130  Identifying your area on acquisition or disposal

    * There will be a separate *your area at each time in an income year when you:

     * (a) acquire an additional part of a *construction expenditure area; or

     * (b) dispose of some but not all of a construction expenditure area.

         * Example: You own half of a building (part A) throughout the income year, and you acquire the other half (part B) on 1 January. This section ensures that part A is your area for the entire year and that part B is your area for the second 6 months of the year.

         * Note: This ensures that the same area is not counted twice in calculating your deduction. You will have to make separate deduction calculations if you have identified more than one area as your area of the capital works.

##### Subdivision 43D--Deductible uses of capital works

##### Guide to Subdivision 43D

##### 43135  What this Subdivision is about

    * You can only get a deduction under this Division if you use your area in a way described in Table 43140 or 43145 of this Subdivision.

##### Table of sections

  * Operative provisions

      * 43140	Using your area in a deductible way

      * 43145	Using your area in the 4% manner

      * 43150	Meaning of _industrial activities_

##### _Operative provisions

##### 43140  Using your area in a deductible way

    * (1) The following table sets out the way you must use *your area in an income year for a deduction to be allowed under section 4310 (the main deduction provision). The relevant use depends on the time when the capital works began (Column 1) and the type of capital works (Column 2). Column 3 sets out the use.

         * Note 1: There are special rules that explain or qualify the uses described in Column 3 of this Table. These rules are set out in Subdivision 43E (sections 43155 to 43195). For example:

           *  	Your area is taken to be used, for use or available for use for a purpose or in a way if it is maintained ready for use for that purpose or in that way. See section 43160.

           *  	R&D activities must be conducted in connection with a business carried on for the purpose of producing assessable income, see section 43195.

         * Note 2: If Division 250 applies to you and an asset that is a capital work:

           * (a) if section 250150 applies--you are taken to be using the capital work for the purpose of producing assessable income, or for the purpose of conducting R&D activities, to the extent specified in a determination made under subsection 250150(3); or

           * (b) otherwise--you are taken not to be using the capital work for such a purpose.

    * (2) This Division applies to an entity as if the entity used property for the *purpose of producing assessable income if the entity uses the property for:

     * (a) *environmental protection activities; or

     * (b) the environmental impact assessment of a project;

    * unless a provision of this Act expressly provides that that use is not for the purpose of producing assessable income.

##### 43145  Using your area in the 4% manner

    * You use a part of *your area in the **_4% manner_** if you use it as described in the following Table. The relevant use depends on the time when the capital works began (Column 1) and the type of capital works (Column 2). Column 3 sets out the use.

         * Note: There are special rules that explain or qualify the uses described in Column 3 of this Table. These rules are set out in Subdivision 43E (sections 43155 to 43195). For example:

           *  	Your area is taken to be used, for use or available for use for a purpose or in a way if it is maintained ready for use for that purpose or in that way. See section 43160.

           *  	A suite of rooms in a hotel building may be treated as one bedroom, see subsection 43180(2).

##### 43160  Your area is used for a purpose if it is maintained ready for use for the purpose

    * A part of *your area is taken to be used, for use or available for use for a particular purpose or in a particular manner at a time if, at that time:

     * (a) it was maintained ready for use for that purpose or in that manner; and

     * (b) it was not used or for use for any other purpose or in any other manner; and

     * (c) its use or intended use for that purpose or in that manner had not been abandoned.

         * Note 1: Construction must be complete before you can deduct an amount, see section 4330.

         * Note 2: This section affects Tables 43140 and 43145.

##### 43165  Temporary cessation of use

    * A part of *your area is taken to be used, for use or available for use for a particular purpose or in a particular manner if its use for that purpose or in that manner temporarily ceases because of:

     * (a) the construction of an extension, alteration or improvement, or the making of repairs; or

     * (b) seasonal or climatic factors.

         * Note: This section affects Tables 43140 and 43145.

##### 43170  Own use--capital works other than hotel and apartment buildings

    * (1) A part of capital works, other than a *hotel building or an *apartment building, is taken not to be used for the *purpose of producing assessable income if that part is for use mainly for, or in association with, residential accommodation by you or an *associate.

         * Note: This subsection affects Tables 43140 and 43145.

    * (2) Subsection (1) does not apply to use by an *associate under an *arrangement:

     * (a) to which you and the associate are parties; and

     * (b) that is of a kind that the parties could reasonably be expected to have entered into if they had been dealing with each other at *arm's length; and

     * (c) that was not entered into for the purpose of obtaining a deduction under this Division.

    * (3) If property that constitutes the whole or part of capital works, other than a *hotel building or an *apartment building, is part of an individual's home, the property is taken to be used, or for use, wholly or mainly for or in association with residential accommodation.

         * Note: This subsection affects Tables 4390 and 43140.

##### 43175  Own use--hotel and apartment buildings

    * (1) An entity is taken not to have used a bedroom in a *hotel building, or an apartment, unit or flat in an *apartment building, for the *purpose of producing assessable income at a time if, at that time, the bedroom, apartment, unit or flat is used, or reserved for use, by:

     * (a) the entity; or

     * (b) if the entity is a partnership--any of the partners in the partnership.

         * Note: This subsection affects Tables 43140 and 43145.

    * (2) Also, an entity is taken not to use a bedroom in a *hotel building, or an apartment, unit or flat in an *apartment building for any purpose at a time if:

     * (a) at that time, a *right to use or a right to occupy the bedroom, apartment, unit or flat was vested in the entity; and

     * (b) that right was vested in the entity because the entity was, at that time, a member of a company, a beneficiary of a trust estate or a partner in a partnership.

         * Note: This subsection affects Tables 4390, 43140 and 43145.

##### 43180  Special rules for hotel and apartment buildings

    * Rules about counting rooms or apartments etc.

    * (1) A bedroom in a *hotel building, or an apartment, unit or flat in an *apartment building, is taken to be used or available for use wholly for shortterm accommodation for travellers in a period if it is used or available for use mainly for shortterm accommodation for travellers in that period.

         * Note: This subsection ensures that a limited period of nonshortterm traveller accommodation use will be disregarded in counting the number of rooms provided the bedroom, apartment, unit or flat is used mainly for shortterm traveller accommodation.

    * (2) For the purpose of counting the number of bedrooms in a *hotel building, if 2 or more rooms that are bedrooms or include a bedroom are for use together as a suite of rooms, the suite is taken to constitute one bedroom.

    * (3) Despite subsection 4350(3) (which treats you as not being the owner of certain capital works), you can still count an apartment, unit or flat in relation to which CGT event F2 has happened in working out whether you own or lease at least 10 apartments, units or flats in an *apartment building if you own or lease at least one other apartment, unit or flat in the building.

         * Note 1: CGT event F2 results in a lease with a term of 50 years or more being treated for CGT purposes more like an outright disposal.

         * Note 2: Subsection 4350(3) treats you as not being the owner of capital works that are the subject of such a lease.

    * Rules about hotel or apartment complexes

    * (4) A group of buildings that constitutes a complex of buildings is taken to be one *hotel building or *apartment building, and none of the buildings in the group is taken to be a separate building.

    * (5) The construction of a *hotel building or *apartment building is taken to be an extension of another building if, after completion of the construction, those buildings are taken to be one building under subsection (4).

         * Note: Subsections (4) and (5) ensure that a hotel or apartment building that provides shortterm traveller accommodation in detached buildings will be treated as a single building so that the 10 hotel room/apartment test is applied to the complex as a whole. It also has the effect that the complex as a whole must be completed before there can be a construction expenditure area.

    * Rules about facilities not commonly provided in Australia

    * (6) If a *hotel building contains a facility of a kind that is not commonly provided in a hotel, motel or guest house in Australia, the facility is taken not to be used or for use to operate a hotel, motel or guest house.

    * (7) If an *apartment building contains a facility of a kind that is not commonly provided in a hotel, motel or guest house in Australia, the facility is taken not to be a facility for use in association with providing shortterm accommodation for travellers in apartments, units or flats.

         * Note: Subsections (6) and (7) exclude areas such as casinos from the construction expenditure area of a hotel building or apartment building.

##### 43185  Residential or display use

    * (1) A building, other than a *hotel building or an *apartment building, or an extension, alteration or improvement to such a building, begun after 19 July 1982 and before 18 July 1985 is taken not to be used for the *purpose of producing assessable income or exempt income if it is used or for use wholly or mainly for exhibition or display in connection with:

     * (a) the sale of all or part of any building; or

     * (b) the lease of all or part of any building for use wholly or mainly for or in association with residential accommodation.

         * Note: Subsection (1) affects time period 2 in Table 4390 and time period 3 in Table 43140.

    * (2) A building, other than a *hotel building or an *apartment building, begun after 19 July 1982 and before 18 July 1985 is taken not to be used for the *purpose of producing assessable income if it is used or available for use wholly or mainly for or in association with residential accommodation.

         * Note: Subsection (2) affects time period 2 in Table 4390 and time period 3 in Table 43140.

    * (3) A building, other than a *hotel building or an *apartment building, begun after 17 July 1985 and before 1 July 1997 is taken not to be used for the *purpose of producing assessable income if it is used or for use wholly or mainly for exhibition or display in connection with the sale of all or part of any building.

         * Note: Subsection (3) affects time periods 2 and 3 in Table 43140.

##### 43190  Use of facilities not commonly provided, and of certain buildings used to operate a hotel, motel or guest house

    * (1) A facility in a *hotel building or an *apartment building that is not commonly provided in a hotel, motel or guest house in Australia is taken not to be used, or for use, for or in association with residential accommodation if the facility is part of a building begun after 19 July 1982 and before 18 July 1985.

         * Note: This subsection means that, for time period 2 in Table 4390, a facility referred to in subsection 43180(6) or (7) (dealing with facilities not commonly provided in Australia) is taken to be a nonresidential building if it satisfies the use test in Column 3 of that table for a building of that kind, and is therefore eligible for deduction even though it would ordinarily be taken to be used for residential accommodation.

    * (2) A building, other than a *hotel building or an *apartment building, begun after 19 July 1982 and before 18 July 1985 that is used, or for use, wholly or mainly for the purpose of operating a hotel, motel or guest house is taken to be used or for use wholly or mainly for, or in association with, residential accommodation.

         * Note: This subsection ensures that hotels, motels and guest houses begun in the specified time period that do not satisfy the tests for hotel and apartment buildings (for example, because they had fewer than 10 bedrooms or apartments) do not qualify for a deduction under this Division.

##### 43195  Use for R&D activities must be in connection with a business

    * You are taken not to use capital works for *R&D activities unless you do so in connection with a business that you carry on for the *purpose of producing assessable income.

         * Note: This section affects Tables 4390 and 43140.

##### Subdivision 43F--Calculation of deduction

##### Guide to Subdivision 43F

##### 43200  What this Subdivision is about

    * This Subdivision shows you how to calculate the amount of a deduction under section 4310. The calculations must be made separately for each area that is identified as your area.

    *  There are 2 separate calculation provisions: One for capital works begun before 27 February 1992; and the other for capital works begun after 26 February 1992.

##### Table of sections

      * 43205	Explanatory material

  * Operative provisions

      * 43210	Deduction for capital works begun after 26 February 1992

      * 43215	Deduction for capital works begun before 27 February 1992

      * 43220	Capital works taken to have begun earlier for certain purposes

##### 43205  Explanatory material

    * Capital works begun before 27 February 1992

    * The calculation for these works is based on *your construction expenditure and the applicable rate of deduction. There can be only one rate of deduction that applies to *your area. However, reductions of deductions may apply.

    * You must reduce your deduction for any period in the income year that you did not own *your area and use it in the way described in Table 43140 (Current year use). Because there are 2 use tests in Table 43140 for *hotel buildings and *apartment buildings (a general income producing test and a more specific hotel and shortterm traveller accommodation use test), there are 2 reduction steps.

    * The first step reduces your deduction if part of *your area was not used as a *hotel building or *apartment building. The second step reduces the deduction to the extent that your area is used only partly for the *purpose of producing assessable income. This occurs, for example, if you *derive both assessable and exempt income, or if part of your area is not used to produce assessable income for all or part of the period it was used as a hotel building or apartment building.

    * Capital works begun after 26 February 1992

    * The calculation for these works is based on a portion of *your construction expenditure and the applicable rate of deduction. There can be 2 rates of deduction for your area depending on the way you use it.

    * If 2 rates apply, there will be a separate calculation for the part of *your area used in the way described in Table 43140 and for the part of *your area used in the way described in Table 43145 (Use in the 4% manner). A gross deduction and subsequent reduction is calculated for each.

    * The reduction is the same as the second reduction for capital works begun before 27 February 1992.

##### Operative provisions

##### 43210  Deduction for capital works begun after 26 February 1992

    * **		Step 1  **Calculate the amount worked out using the formula:

    * where: 

    * **_portion of your CE_** is the portion of *your construction expenditure that is attributable to the part of *your area that you used in the *4% manner.

    * **_days used_** is the number of days in the income year that:

     * (a) you owned or were the lessee of that part of *your area and used it in the *4% manner; or

     * (b) you were the holder of that part of *your area under a *quasiownership right over land granted by an *exempt Australian government agency or an *exempt foreign government agency, and used that part of your area in the 4% manner.

    * **		Step 2  **Reduce the Step 1 amount by the extent to which the part referred to in Step 1 was used only partly for the *purpose of producing assessable income.

         * Note: This Step applies if:

           *  	part of your income from the part referred to in Step 1 is exempt income; or

           *  	part of the part referred to in Step 1 was not used for the purpose of producing assessable income or was not available for that use; or

           *  	the part of the part referred to in Step 1 was not used for such a purpose during a part of the days used period.

    * **		Step 3  **Calculate the amount worked out using the formula:

    * where: 

    * **_portion of your CE_** is the portion of *your construction expenditure that is attributable to the part of *your area that you did not use in the *4% manner but was used as described in Table 43140 (Current year use).

    * **_days used_** is the number of days in the income year that:

     * (a) you owned or were the lessee of that part of *your area and used it in that manner; or

     * (b) you were the holder of that part of *your area under a *quasiownership right over land granted by an *exempt Australian government agency or an *exempt foreign government agency, and used that part of your area in that manner.

    * **		Step 4  **Reduce the Step 3 amount by the extent to which the part referred to in Step 3:

     * (a) for a *hotel building or *apartment building--was used only partly for the *purpose of producing assessable income; or

     * (b) for any other capital works--was used only partly for the purpose of *producing assessable income or conducting *R&D activities.

         * Note: This Step applies if:

           *  	part of your income from the part referred to in Step 3 is exempt income; or

           *  	part of the part referred to in Step 3 was not used for the purpose of producing assessable income (or R&D activities) or was not available for that use; or

           *  	the part of the part referred to in Step 3 was not used for such a purpose during a part of the days used period.

    * **		Step 5  **Add the Step 2 and Step 4 amounts.

    * **		Step 6  **The amount of your deduction is the lesser of your Step 5 amount or the *undeducted construction expenditure for *your area.

##### 43215  Deduction for capital works begun before 27 February 1992

    * **		Step 1  **Calculate the amount worked out using the formula:

    * where: 

    * **_your CE_** is *your construction expenditure.

    * **_days used_** is the number of days in the income year that you owned or were the lessee of *your area and used it in the way that applies to the capital works under Table 43140 (Current year use).

    * **_applicable rate_** is:

     * (a) 0.04 if the capital works began after 21 August 1984 and before 16 September 1987; or

     * (b) 0.025 in any other case.

         * Note: For the purpose of working out the applicable rate, capital works begun after 15 September 1987 are taken to have begun before 16 September 1987 in certain circumstances. See section 43220.

    * **		Step 2  **This step applies only to *hotel buildings and *apartment buildings. Reduce the Step 1 amount by the extent to which:

     * (a) for a hotel building--any part of *your area was not used wholly or mainly to operate a hotel, motel or guest house; or

     * (b) for an apartment building--any part of *your area was not used wholly for or in association with providing shortterm accommodation for travellers.

    * **		Step 3  **Reduce the Step 1 or 2 amount by the extent to which:

     * (a) for a *hotel building or *apartment building--*your area was used only partly for the *purpose of producing assessable income; or

     * (b) for any other capital works--*your area was used only partly for the *purpose of producing assessable income or conducting *R&D activities.

         * Note: This Step applies if:

           *  	part of your income from the capital works is exempt income; or

           *  	part of the capital works were not used for the purpose of producing assessable income or were not available for that use; or

           *  	the capital works were not used for such a purpose during a part of the days used period.

    * **		Step 4  **The amount of your deduction is the lesser of your Step 3 amount or the *undeducted construction expenditure for *your area.

##### 43220  Capital works taken to have begun earlier for certain purposes

    * (1) A building, other than a *hotel building or an *apartment building, or an extension, alteration or improvement to such a building, begun after 15 September 1987 is taken to have begun before 16 September 1987 if:

     * (a) the construction was under a contract that was entered into before 16 September 1987, or was under 2 or more contracts any of which was entered into before that date; or

     * (b) money was borrowed for a purpose that included the purpose of financing the construction under a contract or contracts entered into before 16 September 1987 by an entity that was, or by entities each of which was, a *qualifying investor, and that money was used to finance the construction.

    * (2) An entity is a **_qualifying investor_** for the construction of a building if:

     * (a) at the end of 15 September 1987, the entity was the owner or lessee of the land on which the building was constructed; or

     * (b) the entity became the owner or lessee of the land under a contract entered into before 16 September 1987.

    * (3) An entity is a **_qualifying investor_** for the construction of an extension, alteration or improvement to a building if:

     * (a) at the end of 15 September 1987, the entity was the owner or lessee of the building, or the part of the building to which the extension, alteration or improvement was made; or

     * (b) the entity became the owner or lessee of the building or that part under a contract entered into before 16 September 1987.

     *  	the number of years in which you can deduct amounts for your construction expenditure; and

     *  	the amount that you can deduct under section 4340 if your area or a part is destroyed.

      * 43240	Pre27 February 1992 undeducted construction expenditure

##### Operative provisions

##### 43230  Calculating undeducted construction expenditure--common step

    * (1) Identify the date when the capital works began.

         * Note 1: The date determines whether your calculation is to be made under section 43235 (for post26/2/92 expenditure) or 43240 (for pre27/2/92 expenditure).

         * Note 2: Section 4380 explains when capital works begin.

    * (2) If you are calculating a deduction under Subdivision 43F, identify the period (**_use period_**) that:

     * (a) started when *your area, or a part of it, was first used by any entity for any purpose after completion of the relevant construction; and

     * (b) ended at the end of the preceding income year or, if you acquired your area during the income year, at the end of the day before the time of the acquisition.

    * (3) If you are calculating a deduction under Subdivision 43H, identify the period (**_use period_**) that started at the time described in paragraph (2)(a) and ended at the time of the destruction.

##### 43235  Post26 February 1992 undeducted construction expenditure

    * **		Step 1  **Calculate for each day in the use period the amount worked out using the formula:

    * where: 

    * **_portion of your CE_** is the portion of *your construction expenditure that is attributable to the part of *your area that you used in the *4% manner.

    * **		Step 2  **Calculate for each day in the use period the amount worked out using the formula: 

    * where: 

    * **_portion of your CE_** is the portion of *your construction expenditure that is attributable to the part of *your area that you did not use in the *4% manner.

    * **		Step 3  **Add the aggregate of the amounts calculated under Steps 1 and 2.

    * **		Step 4  **Deduct the sum of those amounts from *your construction expenditure. The result is the **_undeducted construction expenditure_** for *your area.

##### 43240  Pre27 February 1992 undeducted construction expenditure

    * **		Step 1  **Calculate for each day in the use period the amount worked out using the formula:

    * where: 

    * **_your CE_** is *your construction expenditure.

    * **_applicable rate_** is:

     * (a) 0.04 if the capital works began after 21 August 1984 and before 16 September 1987; or

     * (b) 0.025 in any other case.

         * Note: For the purpose of working out the applicable rate, capital works begun after 15 September 1987 are taken to have begun before 16 September 1987 in certain circumstances. See section 43220.

    * **		Step 2  **Deduct the sum of the amounts calculated under Step 1 from *your construction expenditure. The result is the **_undeducted construction expenditure_** for *your area.

##### Subdivision 43H--Balancing deduction on destruction of capital works

##### Guide to Subdivision 43H

##### 43245  What this Subdivision is about

    * You may deduct an amount for the undeducted construction expenditure for your area if your area or part of it is destroyed in the circumstances described in section 4340.

    * This Subdivision shows you how to work out that deduction.

    * The calculations in this Subdivision are made separately for each part of the capital works that is identified as your area.

##### Operative provisions

##### 43250  The amount of the balancing deduction

Method statement

       * Step 1.	Calculate the amount (if any) by which the *undeducted construction expenditure for the part of *your area that was destroyed exceeds the amounts you have received or have a right to receive for the destruction of that part.

       * Step 2.	Reduce the amount at Step 1 if one or more of these happened to that part of *your area:

         * (a) Step 2 or 4 in section 43210, or Step 2 or 3 in section 43215, applied to you or another person for it;

         * (b) you were, or another person was, not allowed a deduction for it under this Division;

         * (c) a deduction for it was not allowed or was reduced (for you or another person) under former Division 10C or 10D of Part III of the _Income Tax Assessment Act 1936_.

       * The reduction under this step must be reasonable.

##### 43255  Amounts received or receivable

    * The amounts you have received or have a right to receive for the destruction of that part of *your area include:

     * (a) an amount received under an insurance policy or otherwise for the destruction of that part; and

     * (b) an amount received for disposing of property that was included in that part of your area, less any demolition expenditure incurred on the property.

##### 43260  Apportioning amounts received for destruction

    * If an amount received or receivable in respect of the destruction of property relates to both the part of *your area for which you are claiming the balancing deduction and to property:

     * (a) the cost of which did not form part of *your construction expenditure; or

     * (b) that is capital works that was not part of your area;

    * you must apportion the amount received or receivable to the amount that is attributable to the part of your area that was destroyed. The apportionment must be reasonable.

#### Division 45--Disposal of leases and leased plant

##### Guide to Division 45

##### 451  What this Division is about

    * This Division is designed to prevent tax being avoided through: 

         * (a) the disposal of leased plant, or an interest in leased plant; or

         * (b) the disposal of a partnership interest in a partnership that leased plant; or

         * (c) the disposal of shares in a 100% subsidiary that leased plant;

    * where amounts have been deducted for the decline in value of the plant.

    * It includes amounts in assessable income. Any benefit received, and any reduction in a liability, is taken into account in calculating the amounts included.

    * Where the disposal of shares in a 100% subsidiary is involved, the companies in the former whollyowned group may be made jointly and severally liable for tax that the former subsidiary does not pay.

         * The excess referred to in paragraph 455(1)(e) is:

         * That amount is included in Sean's assessable income.

         * This amount would be reduced if part of it is included in Sean's assessable income under another provision (see subsection 455(5)).

     * (b) the deductions have been or would be reflected in your interest in the partnership net income or partnership loss; and

     * (c) for most of the time when the partnership *held the plant, it leased it to another entity; and

     * (d) all or part of the lease period occurred on or after 22 February 1999; and

     * (e) on or after that day, you dispose of your interest in the plant, or part of it, and that disposal constitutes a *balancing adjustment event; and

     * (f) the sum of the following amounts is _more than_ that part of the plant's *written down value that is attributable to that interest:

     * (g) the plant's *written down value at the time of that acquisition is less than its market value at that time.

    * (2) However, the former subsidiary is not treated as if it had disposed of the interest and reacquired it if the main business of each of the entities that acquired the direct or indirect beneficial ownership of *shares in the former subsidiary is the same as the main business of the *whollyowned group of which the former subsidiary was a member.

    * (3) The disposal and reacquisition of the interest:

     * (a) is taken to have occurred when that direct or indirect beneficial ownership was acquired; and

     * (a) over a period of at least 10 years during the life of the *injured person; or

     * (b) for the life of the injured person.

    * (2) The *annuity instrument must specify:

     * (a) the date of the first payment of the *annuity; and

     * (b) if the annuity instrument specifies a period of years--the date of the last payment in that period; and

     * (c) the amount of each periodic payment of the annuity.

    * (3) The *annuity instrument may only allow the amount of a payment to be varied by increasing the amount:

     * (a) in order to maintain its real value:

       * (i) by indexation by reference to increases in the *All Groups Consumer Price Index number; or

       * (ii) by indexation by reference to increases in the fulltime adult average weekly ordinary time earnings, published by the Australian Statistician; or

     * (b) by a percentage specified in the annuity instrument.

    * (4) The *annuity instrument may only allow the amount of a particular payment to be varied:

     * (a) by only one of the methods referred to in subsection (3); or

     * (b) by whichever of 2 or more of those methods would result in the biggest or smallest increase.

    * (5) A reference in this section to specifying a date or percentage requires an actual date or figure to be specified, not merely a method of determining a date or figure.

         * Example: Under subsection (2), "13 September 2002" would be allowed, but "The date on which the annuitant finishes university" would not be allowed.

##### 5435  Payments during the guarantee period on the death of the injured person

    * (1) This section applies if the *annuity instrument provides for payments to be made to the *injured person during any part of the period ending 10 years after the *date of the settlement or order (whether the *annuity is expressed to be for the life of the person or for a period of years).

    * (2) The *annuity instrument may specify a period (the **_guarantee period_**) of up to 10 years after the *date of the settlement or order, during which, if the *injured person dies, the payments (the **_remaining payments_**) for the remainder of the guarantee period that would have been paid to the injured person are to be paid instead to:

     * (a) the injured person's estate; or

     * (b) a reversionary beneficiary.

         * Note: For tax exemptions in this situation, see sections 5465 and 5470.

    * (3) If the *annuity instrument provides for the remaining payments to be made to a reversionary beneficiary, the instrument must:

     * (a) name the beneficiary; and

     * (b) allow the beneficiary to choose either:

       * (i) to be paid the amounts of the remaining payments when the injured person would have received them; or

       * (ii) to commute those payments into a lump sum worked out under subsection (5).

    * (4) The *injured person's estate may only be paid the lump sum worked out under subsection (5) (and not the periodic payments).

    * (5) The amount of the lump sum under subparagraph (3)(b)(ii) or subsection (4) is the *policy termination value of the *life insurance policy that is the *annuity instrument, as calculated by an *actuary as at the date of the injured person's death. In making this calculation, the following are to be disregarded:

     * (a) any payments of the annuity due to be made after the end of the guarantee period;

     * (b) any *structured settlement lump sums that are also provided for by that policy.

    * (6) In this section:

    * **_pay to a person_** includes pay to the trustee of a trust of which the person is the beneficiary.

    * **_pay to the injured person's estate_** includes pay to the trustee of a trust established by the *injured person's will.

##### 5440  Requirement for minimum monthly level of support

    * (1) Either:

     * (a) the *annuity instrument must provide; or

     * (b) if there is more than one *annuity provided under the *structured settlement or *structured order--the annuity instruments for all of those annuities that satisfy the other conditions in this Subdivision, taken as a whole, must provide;

    * that at least once a month for the life of the *injured person, he or she is to be paid an amount that equals or exceeds the minimum monthly level of support.

    * (2) The **_minimum monthly level of support_** means:

     * (a) for the year starting on the *date of the settlement or order--one twelfth of the amount that is, on that date, the sum of:

       * (i) the maximum basic rate of age pension payable to a person in accordance with item 1 of Table B in point 1064B1 of Pension Rate Calculator A in section 1064 of the _Social Security Act 1991_; and

       * (ii) the amount of a person's pension supplement, worked out (using that maximum basic rate) in accordance with Module BA of that Pension Rate Calculator; and

     * (b) for any subsequent year starting on an anniversary of the date of the settlement or order:

       * (i) if the indexation factor for the year (see subsection (3)) is greater than 1--the amount worked out under subsection (4); or

       * (ii) otherwise--the minimum monthly level of support for the previous year.

         * Note: In working out the rate and amount that count for the purposes of paragraph (a), the effect of the indexation provisions in sections 1191 to 1195 of the _Social Security Act 1991 _must be taken into account. The indexed figures are available from the Department administered by the Minister administering the _Human Services (Centrelink) Act 1997_.

    * (3) The **_indexation factor _**for a year is to be worked out on the anniversary of the *date of the settlement or order in accordance with the formula:

    * where: 

    * **_base year _**means:

     * (a) if there have been one or more previous years for which the indexation factor was greater than 1--the year ending immediately before the most recent year for which the indexation factor was greater than 1; or

     * (b) otherwise--the year ending immediately before the *date of the settlement or order.

         * Note: This has effect subject to subsection (6).

    * (4) If the indexation factor for a year is greater than 1, then the minimum monthly level of support for the year is the amount worked out in accordance with the following formula:

    * (5) The results under subsections (3) and (4) must be rounded to 3 decimal places (rounding up if the fourth decimal place is 5 or more).

    * (6) The indexation factor for a year must be worked out by reference to figures for the same *quarter (for example, the March quarter) as has been used in previous years, even if, on the anniversary of the *date of the settlement or order, the *All Groups Consumer Price Index number for that quarter has not yet been published. If this happens, the calculation must be made as soon as practicable after the number for that quarter is published.

    * (7) In this section:

    * **_pay to a person_** includes pay to the trustee of a trust of which the person is the beneficiary.
