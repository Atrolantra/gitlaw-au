##### Guide to Division 230

##### 2301  What this Division is about

    * This Division is about the tax treatment of gains and losses from your financial arrangements.

    * You recognise the gains and losses, as appropriate, over the life of a financial arrangement and ignore distinctions between income and capital unless specific rules apply.

    * If it is sufficiently certain that you will make a gain or loss, you use a compounding accruals method to recognise the gain or loss. Otherwise you use a realisation method. Instead of either, you may be able to choose to use a fair value or hedging method or to rely on your financial reports. You may also be able to choose to recognise foreign exchange gains and losses using a retranslation method.

##### 2305  Scope of this Division

    * (1) You have a financial arrangement if you have one or more cash settlable legal or equitable rights and/or obligations to receive or provide a financial benefit.

    * (2) This Division does not apply to all financial arrangements. The main exceptions are if:

      * (a) you are:

        * (i) an individual; or

        * (ii) a superannuation entity or fund, managed investment scheme or an entity substantially similar to a managed investment scheme under foreign law with assets of less than $100 million; or

        * (iii) an ADI, securitisation vehicle or other financial sector entity with an aggregated turnover of less than $20 million; or

        * (iv) another entity with an aggregated turnover of less than $100 million, financial assets of less than $100 million and assets of less than $300 million;

      * and either: 

        * (iva) the arrangement is to end not more than 12 months after you start to have it; or

        * (v) the arrangement is not a qualifying security; or

      * (b) the arrangement is a financial arrangement under section 23050 (equity interests etc.) and neither a fair value election, a hedging financial arrangement election nor an election to rely on financial reports applies to the arrangement.

          * Note: Section 230455 provides for the exceptions referred to in paragraph (a).

##### Objects

##### 23010  Objects of this Division

    * The objects of this Division are: 

      * (a) to minimise the extent to which the tax treatment of gains and losses from your *financial arrangements distorts, by providing inappropriate impediments and stimulation, your trading, financing and investment decisions and your risk taking and risk management; and

      * (b) to do so by aligning more closely the tax and commercial recognition of gains and losses from your financial arrangements in the following ways:

        * (i) by allocating the gains and losses to income years throughout the life of your financial arrangements on a reasonable basis;

        * (ii) by generally recognising gains and losses on revenue rather than capital account; and

      * (c) to appropriately take account of, and minimise, your compliance costs.

##### Tax treatment of gains and losses from financial arrangements

##### 23015  Gains are assessable and losses deductible

    * Gains

    * (1) Your assessable income includes a gain you make from a *financial arrangement.

          * Note: This Division does not apply to gains that are subject to exceptions under Subdivision 230H.

    * Losses

    * (2) You can deduct a loss you make from a *financial arrangement, but only to the extent that:

      * (a) you make it in gaining or producing your assessable income; or

      * (b) you necessarily make it in carrying on a *business for the purpose of gaining or producing your assessable income.

          * Note: This Division does not apply to losses that are subject to exceptions under Subdivision 230H.

    * (3) You can also deduct a loss you make from a *financial arrangement if:

      * (a) you are an *Australian entity; and

      * (b) you make the loss in deriving income from a foreign source; and

      * (c) the income is *nonassessable nonexempt income under section 7685, or section 23AI or 23AK of the _Income Tax Assessment Act 1936_; and

      * (d) the loss is, in whole or in part, a cost in relation to a *debt interest you issue that is covered by paragraph 82040(1)(a).

    * You can deduct the loss only to the extent to which it is a cost in relation to a *debt interest you issue that is covered by paragraph 82040(1)(a).

          * Note: This Division does not apply to losses that are subject to exceptions under Subdivision 230H.

    * (4) If the *financial arrangement is a *debt interest, the loss is not prevented from being deductible for an income year under subsection (2) merely because of either or both of the following:

      * (a) one or more of the *financial benefits that are taken into account in working out the amount of the loss are *contingent on the economic performance (whether past, current or future) of:

        * (i) you or a part of your activities; or

        * (ii) a *connected entity of yours or a part of the activities of a connected entity of yours;

      * (b) one or more of the financial benefits that are taken into account in working out the amount of the loss secure a permanent or enduring benefit for you or a connected entity of yours.

    * (4A) A *dividend on a *debt interest is a loss you can deduct to the extent to which it would have been a deductible loss under subsection (2) if:

      * (a) the payment of the amount of the dividend were the incurring of a liability to pay the same amount as interest; and

      * (b) that interest were incurred in respect of the finance raised by you and in respect of which the dividend was paid or provided; and

      * (c) the debt interest retained its character as a debt interest for the purposes of subsection (4).

    * (5) Subject to subsection (6), subsection (4) does not apply to the loss to the extent to which the annually compounded internal rate of return on the *debt interest exceeds the *benchmark rate of return for the debt interest increased by 150 basis points.

    * (6) If:

      * (a) regulations made for the purposes of subsection 2585(6) provide that a specified number of basis points is to apply for the purposes of applying subsection 2585(5) in particular circumstances; and

      * (b) those circumstances exist in relation to the *debt interest;

    * subsection (5) applies as if the reference in that subsection to 150 basis points were a reference to the number of basis points specified in the regulations.

    * Division does not affect foreign residence rules

    * (7) Nothing in this Division affects the operation of the provisions of Division 6 that provide for the significance of foreign residence for the assessability of ordinary and statutory income.

          * Note 1: Gains that you make under this Division may be ordinary or statutory income for the purposes of Division 6.

          * Note 2: For the effect of a change of residence during an income year, see sections 230485 and 230490.

##### 23020  Gain or loss to be taken into account only once under this Act

    * Section does not give rise to exempt income

    * (4) A *financial benefit is not to be treated as *exempt income merely because it is not included in your assessable income under this section.

    * (1) Despite section 23015, a gain that you make from a *financial arrangement:

      * (b) to the extent that it reflects an amount that would be treated or would reasonably expected to be treated, as *nonassessable nonexempt income under a provision of this Act if this Division were disregarded--is not assessable income and is not exempt income.

    * (2) Despite section 23015, a gain that you make from a *financial arrangement:

      * (a) to the extent that, if it had been a loss, you would have made it in gaining or producing *exempt income--is exempt income; and

    * (3) A loss you make from a *financial arrangement is _not_ allowable as a deduction to you under any provision of this Act (other than subsection 23015(3)) to the extent that you make it in gaining or producing your:

      * (a) *exempt income; or 

      * (b) *nonassessable nonexempt income.

    * Elections override accruals and realisation methods

    * (4) Subdivision 230B (accruals and realisation method) does not apply to a gain or loss you make from a *financial arrangement:

           * Note: See subsection (5) of this section and subsection 230230(4).

      * (b) to the extent that Subdivision 230D (foreign exchange retranslation method) applies to the gain or loss; or

      * (c) to the extent that Subdivision 230E (hedging financial arrangements method) applies to the arrangement; or

      * (d) if Subdivision 230F (method of relying on financial reports) applies to the arrangement; or

    * Priorities among election methods

    * (5) Subdivision 230C (fair value method) does not apply to a gain or loss you make from a *financial arrangement:

##### Financial arrangement concept

##### 23045  Financial arrangement

    * (1) You have a **_financial arrangement _**if you have, under an *arrangement:

      * (a) a *cash settlable legal or equitable right to receive a *financial benefit; or

      * (b) a cash settlable legal or equitable obligation to provide a financial benefit; or

      * (c) a combination of one or more such rights and/or one or more such obligations;

    * unless: 

      * (d) you also have under the arrangement one or more legal or equitable rights to receive something and/or one or more legal or equitable obligations to provide something; and

      * (e) for one or more of the rights and/or obligations covered by paragraph (d):

        * (i) the thing that you have the right to receive, or the obligation to provide, is not a financial benefit; or

        * (ii) the right or obligation is not cash settlable; and

      * (f) the one or more rights and/or obligations covered by paragraph (e) are not insignificant in comparison with the right, obligation or combination covered by paragraph (a), (b) or (c).

    * The right, obligation or combination covered by paragraph (a), (b) or (c) constitutes the financial arrangement.

          * Note 1: Whether your rights and/or obligations under an arrangement constitute a financial arrangement can change over time depending on changes either to the terms of the arrangement or external circumstances (such as particular rights or obligations under the arrangement being satisfied by the parties). For example, a contract may provide for the transfer of a boat in 6 months time and payment of the contract price at the end of 2 years. Until the boat is delivered, there is no financial arrangement because of the operation of paragraphs (d), (e) and (f) above. Once the boat is delivered, there is a financial arrangement because those paragraphs are no longer applicable.

          * Note 2: The operative provisions of this Division do not apply to all financial arrangements, and only apply partially to some: see the exceptions in Subdivision 230H.

          * Note 3: There are some rules in this Division that tell you what happens if an arrangement ceases to be a financial arrangement (see Subdivision 230G and section 230505).

    * (2) A right you have to receive, or an obligation you have to provide, a *financial benefit is **_cash settlable_** if, and only if:

      * (a) the benefit is money or a *money equivalent; or

      * (b) in the case of a right--you intend to satisfy or settle it by receiving money or a money equivalent or by starting to have, or ceasing to have, another *financial arrangement; or

      * (c) in the case of an obligation--you intend to satisfy or settle it by providing money or a money equivalent or by starting to have, or ceasing to have, another financial arrangement; or

      * (d) you have a practice of satisfying or settling similar rights or obligations as mentioned in paragraph (b) or (c) (whether or not you intend to satisfy or settle the right or obligation in that way); or

      * (e) you deal with the right or obligation, or with similar rights or obligations, in order to generate a profit from shortterm fluctuations in price, from a dealer's margin, or from both; or

      * (f) none of paragraphs (a) to (e) applies but you satisfy subsection (3); or

      * (g) you are able to settle the right or obligation as mentioned in paragraph (b) or (c) (whether or not you intend to satisfy or settle the right or obligation in that way) and you do not have, as your sole or dominant purpose for entering into the arrangement under which you are to receive or provide the financial benefit, the purpose of receiving or delivering the financial benefit as part of your expected purchase, sale or usage requirements.

    * A reference in paragraph (b) or (c) to a financial arrangement does not include a reference to something that is a financial arrangement under section 23050.

          * Note: Examples of dealing of the kind covered by paragraph (e) are:

           * (a) dealing with the right or obligation, or similar rights or obligations, on a frequent basis, a shortterm basis or on a frequent and shortterm basis; and

           * (b) acquiring the right or obligation, or similar rights or obligations, and managing the resulting risk by entering into offsetting arrangements that provide a profit margin.

    * (3) You satisfy this subsection if:

      * (a) the *financial benefit is readily convertible into money or a *money equivalent; and

      * (b) there is a market for the financial benefit that has a high degree of liquidity; and

      * (c) subsection (4) or (5) is satisfied.

    * (4) This subsection is satisfied if, for the recipient of the *financial benefit, the amount of the money or *money equivalent referred to in paragraph (3)(a) is not subject to a substantial risk of substantial decrease in value.

    * (5) This subsection is satisfied if your purpose, or one of your purposes, for entering into the arrangement under which you are to receive or provide the *financial benefit, is to receive or deliver the financial benefit:

      * (a) to raise or provide finance; or

      * (b) if paragraph (a) does not apply--so that it may be converted or liquidated into money or a money equivalent (other than as part of your expected purchase, sale or usage requirements).

##### 23050  Financial arrangement (equity interest or right or obligation in relation to equity interest)

    * (1) You also have a **_financial arrangement_** if you have an *equity interest. The equity interest constitutes the financial arrangement.

    * (2) You also have a **_financial arrangement_** if:

      * (a) you have, under an *arrangement:

        * (i) a legal or equitable right to receive something that is a financial arrangement under this section; or

        * (ii) a legal or equitable obligation to provide something that is a financial arrangement under this section; or

        * (iii) a combination of one or more such rights and/or obligations; and

      * (b) the right, obligation or combination does not constitute, or form part of, a financial arrangement under subsection 23045(1).

    * The right, obligation or combination referred to in paragraph (a) constitutes the financial arrangement.

          * Note 1: Paragraph 23040(4)(e) prevents the accruals method or the realisation method being applied to something that is a financial arrangement under this section.

          * Note 2: Subsection 230270(1) prevents the retranslation method being applied to something that is a financial arrangement under this section.

          * Note 3: Subsection 230330(1) prevents the hedging method being applied to something that is a financial arrangement under this section.

##### 23055  Rights, obligations and arrangements (grouping and disaggregation rules)

    * Single right or obligation or multiple rights or obligations?

    * (1) If you have a right to receive 2 or more *financial benefits, you are taken, for the purposes of this Division, to have a separate right to receive each of those financial benefits.

    * (2) If you have an obligation to provide 2 or more *financial benefits, you are taken, for the purposes of this Division, to have a separate obligation to provide each of those financial benefits.

    * (3) Subsections (1) and (2) apply for the avoidance of doubt.

    * Matters relevant to determining what rights and/or obligations constitute particular arrangements

    * (4) For the purposes of this Division, whether a number of rights and/or obligations are themselves an *arrangement or are 2 or more separate arrangements is a question of fact and degree that you determine having regard to the following:

      * (a) the nature of the rights and/or obligations;

      * (b) their terms and conditions (including those relating to any payment or other consideration for them);

      * (c) the circumstances surrounding their creation and their proposed exercise or performance (including what can reasonably be seen as the purposes of one or more of the entities involved);

      * (d) whether they can be dealt with separately or must be dealt with together;

      * (e) normal commercial understandings and practices in relation to them (including whether they are regarded commercially as separate things or as a group or series that forms a whole);

      * (f) the objects of this Division.

    * In applying this subsection, have regard to the matters referred to in paragraphs (a) to (f) both in relation to the rights and/or obligations separately and in relation to the rights and/or obligations in combination with each other.

          * Example 1: Your rights and obligations under a typical convertible note, including the right to convert the note into a share or shares, would constitute one arrangement.

          * Example 2: Your rights and obligations under a typical pricelinked or indexlinked bond would constitute one arrangement.

          * Note 1: If you raised funds by means of a contract that you would not have entered into without entering into another contract, and neither contract could be assigned to a third party without the other also being assigned, this would tend to indicate that your rights and obligations under the 2 contracts together constitute one arrangement.

          * Note 2: If the commercial effect of your individual rights and/or obligations in a group or series cannot be understood without reference to the group or series as a whole, this would tend to indicate that all of your rights and/or obligations in the group or series together constitute one arrangement.

##### General rules

##### 23060  When financial benefit provided or received under financial arrangement

    * Financial benefit provided under financial arrangement

    * (1) You are taken, for the purposes of this Division, to have (or to have had) an obligation to provide a *financial benefit under a *financial arrangement if:

      * (a) you have (or had) an obligation to provide the financial benefit in relation to the arrangement; and

      * (b) the financial benefit would not otherwise be treated as one that you have (or had) an obligation to provide under the arrangement; and

      * (c) the financial benefit plays an integral role in determining:

        * (i) whether you make a gain or loss from the arrangement; or

        * (ii) the amount of such a gain or loss.

    * Paragraph (a) applies even if the entity to which you provide the financial benefit is not a party to the arrangement.

          * Note: This means that the financial benefits you provide to acquire the financial arrangement (whether to the issuer, a previous holder or a third party) are taken to be financial benefits you provide under the arrangement. The financial benefits you provide may include, for example, fees paid or the forgoing of rights to receive a financial benefit.

    * Financial benefit received under financial arrangement

    * (2) You are taken, for the purposes of this Division, to have (or to have had) a right to receive a *financial benefit under a *financial arrangement if:

      * (a) you have (or had) a right to receive the financial benefit in relation to the arrangement; and

      * (b) the financial benefit would not otherwise be treated as one that you have (or had) a right to receive under the arrangement; and

      * (c) the financial benefit plays an integral role in determining:

        * (i) whether you make a gain or loss from the arrangement; or

        * (ii) the amount of such a gain or loss.

    * Paragraph (a) applies even if the entity that provides the financial benefit is not a party to the arrangement.

          * Note: The financial benefits you receive may include, for example, the waiving of an obligation you have to provide a financial benefit.

##### 23065  Amount of financial benefit relating to more than one financial arrangement etc.

    * (1) This section applies if:

      * (a) a *financial benefit plays the integral role mentioned in paragraph 23060(1)(c) or (2)(c) in relation to a *financial arrangement; and

      * (b) either or both of the following apply:

        * (i) the financial benefit plays that role in relation to one or more other financial arrangements;

        * _	_(ii)	the financial benefit is provided or received for one or more other things that are not financial arrangements.

    * (2) For the purposes of this Division, determine the amount of the *financial benefit that plays that role in relation to a particular *financial arrangement by apportioning the actual amount of the financial benefit, on a reasonable basis, between:

      * (a) that financial arrangement; and

      * (b) each other financial arrangement (if any) in relation to which the benefit plays that role; and

      * (c) each other thing (if any) mentioned in subparagraph (1)(b)(ii).

##### 23070  Apportionment when financial benefit received or right ceases

    * (1) Apply subsection (2) in working out whether you make, or will make, a gain or loss (and the amount of the gain or loss) at a time when:

      * (a) you receive a particular *financial benefit under a *financial arrangement; or

      * (b) one of your rights under a financial arrangement ceases.

    * The gain or loss is to be calculated in nominal (and not *present value) terms.

    * (2) You must have regard to the extent to which the *financial benefits that you have provided, or are to provide or might provide, under the *financial arrangement are reasonably attributable, at the time mentioned in subsection (1), to the benefit or right referred to in paragraph (1)(a) or (b).

    * (3) Any attribution made under subsection (2) must reflect appropriate and commercially accepted valuation principles that properly take into account:

      * (a) the nature of the rights and obligations under the *financial arrangement; and

      * (b) the risks associated with each *financial benefit, right and obligation under the arrangement; and

      * (c) the time value of money.

          * Note: Generally, no financial benefit you have provided, or are to provide or might provide, under a financial arrangement is reasonably attributable to an amount you receive that is in the nature of interest.

##### 23075  Apportionment when financial benefit provided or obligation ceases

    * (1) Apply subsection (2) in working out whether you make, or will make, a gain or loss (and the amount of the gain or loss) at a time when:

      * (a) you provide a particular *financial benefit under the *financial arrangement; or

      * (b) one of your obligations under a financial arrangement ceases.

    * The gain or loss is to be calculated in nominal (and not *present value) terms.

    * (2) You must have regard to the extent to which the *financial benefits that you have received, or are to receive or might receive, under the *financial arrangement are reasonably attributable, at the time mentioned in subsection (1), to the benefit or obligation referred to in paragraph (1)(a) or (b).

    * (3) Any attribution made under subsection (2) must reflect appropriate and commercially accepted valuation principles that properly take into account:

      * (a) the nature of the rights and obligations under the *financial arrangement; and

      * (b) the risks associated with each *financial benefit, right and obligation under the arrangement; and

      * (c) the time value of money.

          * Note: Generally, no financial benefit you have received, or are to receive or might receive, under a financial arrangement is reasonably attributable to an amount you provide that is in the nature of interest.

##### 23080  Consistency in working out gains or losses (integrity measure)

    * Object of section

    * (1) The object of this section is to stop you obtaining an inappropriate tax benefit from not working out your gains and losses in a consistent manner.

    * Consistent treatment for particular financial arrangement

    * (2) If:

      * (a) this Division provides that a particular method applies to gains or losses you have from a *financial arrangement; and

      * (b) that method allows you to choose the particular manner in which you apply that method;

    * you must use that manner consistently for the arrangement for all income years.

    * Consistent treatment for financial arrangements of essentially the same nature

    * (3) If:

      * (a) this Division provides that a particular method applies to gains or losses you have from 2 or more *financial arrangements; and

      * (b) that method allows you to choose the particular manner in which you apply that method;

    * you must use that same manner consistently for all of those financial arrangements that are essentially of the same nature.

    * (4) Subsection (3) does not require you to use that same manner consistently for:

      * (a) a *financial arrangement that you start to have on or after the time a *Commonwealth law that amends the method is made; and

      * (b) a financial arrangement that you start to have before that time;

    * if: 

      * (c) the Commonwealth law allows you to choose to apply the method in a particular manner (being a manner in which you are not, apart from the Commonwealth law, allowed to apply the method); and

      * (d) the inconsistency is entirely due to you choosing to apply the method in that manner to the financial arrangement mentioned in paragraph (a).

##### 23085  Rights and obligations include contingent rights and obligations

    * To avoid doubt: 

      * (a) a right is treated as a right for the purposes of this Division even if it is subject to a contingency; and

      * (b) an obligation is treated as an obligation for the purposes of this Division even if it is subject to a contingency.

##### Guide to Subdivision 230B

##### 23090  What this Subdivision is about

    * This Subdivision applies the accruals method to determine the amount and timing of gains and losses from a financial arrangement if they are sufficiently certain for such accrual to be done.

    * This Subdivision applies the realisation method to determine the amount and timing of gains and losses if they are not sufficiently certain to be dealt with under the accruals method.

    * If the accruals method is applied to a gain or loss on the basis of an estimate of a financial benefit and the benefit when received or provided is more or less than the estimate, a balancing adjustment is made to correct for the underestimate or overestimate.

    * If the accruals method is being applied to gains and losses from the arrangement and there is a material change to the arrangement, or the circumstances in which it operates, a reassessment is made of whether the accruals method or the realisation method should apply to gains and losses from the arrangement.

    * A change in circumstances may also cause a reestimation of gains and losses that the accruals method is being applied to.

##### Objects of Subdivision

##### 23095  Objects of this Subdivision

    * The objects of this Subdivision are: 

      * (a) to properly recognise gains and losses from *financial arrangements by allocating them to appropriate periods of time; and

      * (b) to reduce compliance costs by reflecting commercial accounting concepts where appropriate; and

      * (c) to minimise tax deferral.

##### When accruals method or realisation method applies

##### 230100  When accruals method or realisation method applies

    * When accruals method applies and when realisation method applies

    * (1) This section tells you when to apply the accruals method and when to apply the realisation method if this Subdivision applies to gains and losses from a *financial arrangement.

    * Accruals method--sufficiently certain overall gain or loss at start time

    * (2) The accruals method provided for in this Subdivision applies to a gain or loss you have from a *financial arrangement if:

      * (a) the gain or loss is an overall gain or loss from the arrangement; and

      * (b) the gain or loss is sufficiently certain at the time when you start to have the arrangement; and

      * (c) you choose to apply the accruals method to the gain or loss, or subsection (4) applies to the gain or loss.

          * Note: Subsection 230105(1) tells you when you have a sufficiently certain overall gain or loss.

    * Accruals method--sufficiently certain particular gain or loss

    * (3) The accruals method provided for in this Subdivision also applies to a gain or loss you have from a *financial arrangement if:

      * (a) the gain or loss arises from a *financial benefit that you are to receive or are to provide under the arrangement; and

      * (b) the gain or loss:

        * (i) is sufficiently certain before or at the time when you start to have the arrangement and before you are to receive or provide the benefit; or

        * (ii) becomes sufficiently certain after the time when you start to have the arrangement and before you are to receive or provide the benefit; and

      * (c) the benefit has not already been taken into account in applying:

        * (i) the accruals method provided for in this Subdivision; or

        * (ii) the realisation method provided for in this Subdivision;

      * to another gain or loss from the arrangement.

    * This subsection has effect subject to subsection (4).

          * Note: Subsection 230110(1) tells you when you have a sufficiently certain gain or loss at a particular time.

    * Accruals method--particular gain or loss becomes sufficiently certain

    * (3A) The accruals method provided for in this Subdivision also applies to a gain or loss you have from a *financial arrangement if:

      * (a) the gain or loss arises from a *financial benefit that you are to receive or are to provide under the arrangement; and

      * (b) the gain or loss becomes sufficiently certain at the time you receive or provide the benefit; and

      * (c) at least part of the period over which the gain or loss would be spread under that method (assuming that method applied) occurs after the time you receive or provide the benefit.

    * This subsection has effect subject to subsection (4).

           * Note 1: Subsection 230110(1) tells you when you have a sufficiently certain gain or loss at a particular time.

           * Note 2: For the period over which the gain or loss would be spread, see subsections 230130(3) to (5).

    * Accruals method--particular gain or loss from qualifying security

    * (4) Subsection (3) or (3A) does not apply to a gain or loss that you have from a *financial arrangement if:

      * (a) you are:

        * (i) an individual; or

        * (ii) an entity (other than an individual) that satisfies subsection 230455(2), (3) or (4) for the income year in which you start to have the arrangement; and

      * (b) the arrangement is a *qualifying security; and

      * (c) you have not made an election under subsection 230455(7).

    * Realisation method--gain or loss not sufficiently certain

    * (5) The realisation method provided for in this Subdivision applies to a gain or loss that you have from a *financial arrangement if the accruals method provided for in this Subdivision does not apply to that gain or loss.

          * Note: Section 230180 tells you how to apply the realisation method to the gain or loss.

##### 230105  Sufficiently certain overall gain or loss

    * (1) You have a sufficiently certain overall gain or loss from a *financial arrangement at the time when you start to have the arrangement only if it is sufficiently certain at that time that you will make an overall gain or loss from the arrangement of:

      * (a) a particular amount; or

      * (b) at least a particular amount.

    * The amount of the gain or loss is the amount referred to in paragraph (a) or (b).

          * Note: Sections 23070 and 23075 (about apportionment of financial benefits) only apply in working out whether you make, or will make, a gain or loss (and the amount of the gain or loss) when particular events happen. They do not apply in working out, at the time when you start to have a financial arrangement, whether it is sufficiently certain that you will make an overall gain or loss from the arrangement.

    * (2) In applying subsection (1), you must:

      * (a) assume that you will continue to have the *financial arrangement for the rest of its life; and

      * (b) have regard to the extent of the risk that a *financial benefit that you are not sufficiently certain to provide or receive under the arrangement may reduce the amount of the gain or loss.

##### 230110  Sufficiently certain gain or loss from particular event

    * (1) You have a sufficiently certain gain or loss from a *financial arrangement at a particular time if it is sufficiently certain at that time that you make, or will make, a gain or loss from the arrangement of:

      * (a) a particular amount; or

      * (b) at least a particular amount;

    * when one of the following occurs: 

      * (c) you receive a particular *financial benefit under the arrangement or one of your rights under the arrangement ceases;

      * (d) you provide a particular financial benefit under the arrangement or one of your obligations under the arrangement ceases.

    * The amount of the gain or loss is the amount referred to in paragraph (a) or (b).

    * (2) In applying subsection (1) to work out whether you have a sufficiently certain gain or loss at a particular time:

      * (a) have regard to the extent of the risk that a *financial benefit that you are not sufficiently certain to provide or receive under the arrangement may reduce the amount of the gain or loss, and the extent to which such a financial benefit is, for the purposes of subsection 23070(2) or 23075(2), reasonably attributable to the benefit, right or obligation mentioned in paragraph (1)(c) or (d) of this section at the time mentioned in subsection (1); and

      * (b) disregard any financial benefit that has already been taken into account, under subsection 230105(1), in working out, at the time when you started to have the arrangement, the amount of a sufficiently certain overall gain or loss from the *financial arrangement to which the accruals method applies; and

      * (c) disregard any financial benefit (or that part of any financial benefit) that has already been taken into account in working out the amount of a sufficiently certain gain or loss from the *financial arrangement under subsection (1).

          * Note: Sections 23070 and 23075 allow you to apportion financial benefits provided and financial benefits received in working out the amount of a gain or loss.

##### 230115  Sufficiently certain financial benefits

    * (1) In deciding for the purposes of this Subdivision whether it is sufficiently certain at a particular time that you make, or will make, a gain or loss from a *financial arrangement:

      * (a) have regard only to:

        * (i) *financial benefits that you are sufficiently certain to receive; and

        * (ii) financial benefits that you are sufficiently certain to provide; and

      * (b) have regard to those financial benefits only to the extent that the amount or value of the benefits is, at that time, fixed or determinable with reasonable accuracy.

          * Note: The particular time may be the time at which you start to have the arrangement.

    * (2) A *financial benefit that you are to receive or provide is to be treated as one that you are sufficiently certain to receive or to provide only if:

      * (a) it is reasonably expected that you will receive or provide the financial benefit (assuming that you will continue to have the *financial arrangement for the rest of its life); and

      * (b) at least some of the amount or value of the benefit is, at that time, fixed or determinable with reasonable accuracy.

    * (3) In applying subsection (2) to the *financial benefit:

      * (a) you must have regard to:

        * (i) the terms and conditions of the *financial arrangement; and

        * (ii) accepted pricing and valuation techniques; and

        * (iii) the economic or commercial substance and effect of the arrangement; and

        * (iv) the contingencies that attach to the other financial benefits that are to be provided or received under the arrangement; and

      * (b) you must treat the financial benefit as if it were not contingent if it is appropriate to do so having regard to the contingencies that attach to the other financial benefits that are to be received or provided under the arrangement.

    * (4) In applying paragraph (2)(b) at a particular time (the**_ reference time_**) to a *financial benefit that depends on a variable that is based on:

      * (a) an interest rate; or

      * (b) a rate that solely or primarily reflects the time value of money; or

      * (c) a rate that solely or primarily reflects a consumer price index; or

      * (d) a rate that solely or primarily reflects an index prescribed by the regulations for the purposes of this paragraph;

    * you must assume that that variable will continue to have the value it has at the reference time.

    * (5) Despite subsection (4), in applying paragraph (2)(b) at a particular time to a *financial benefit that depends on a rate of change to a variable that is based on:

      * (a) a rate that solely or primarily reflects a consumer price index; or

      * (b) a rate that solely or primarily reflects an index prescribed by the regulations for the purposes of this paragraph;

    * you must assume that the rate of change to that variable will continue to be the rate of change that is current at that time.

    * (6) If subsection (4) or (5) applies to a gain or loss and you are determining the amount of the gain or loss at a particular time, you must also assume that that variable will continue to have the value that it has at that time.

    * (7) Subsections (4) and (5) do not limit paragraph (2)(b).

    * (8) If all of the *financial benefits provided and received under the *financial arrangement are denominated in a particular *foreign currency, those financial benefits are not to be translated into:

      * (a) your *applicable functional currency; or

      * (b) if you do not have an applicable functional currency--Australian currency;

    * for the purposes of applying subsection (2) to the arrangement.

    * (9) To avoid doubt:

      * (a) a *financial benefit that you have already provided at a particular time is taken to be one that it is, at that time, a financial benefit that you are sufficiently certain to provide; and

      * (b) a financial benefit that you have already received at a particular time is taken to be one that it is, at that time, a financial benefit that you are sufficiently certain to receive.

##### 230120  Financial arrangements with notional principal

    * (1) This section applies to a *financial arrangement that you have if, in substance or effect, and having regard to the pricing, terms and conditions of the arrangement:

      * (a) the arrangement consists of these things:

        * (i) a leg, the *financial benefits to be provided or received in respect of which are calculated by reference to, or are reasonably related to, a notional principal;

        * (ii) another leg, the financial benefits to be provided or received in respect of which also are calculated by reference to, or are reasonably related to, a notional principal;

        * (iii) if the arrangement includes one or more other things--those things; and

      * (b) when you start to have the arrangement, the value of the notional principal in relation to one leg is equal to the value of the notional principal in relation to the other leg; and

      * (c) all or part of the notional principal in relation to each leg is provided or received at a time, regardless of whether that time is different in relation to each leg.

          * Example: A swap contract.

    * (2) To avoid doubt, the *financial benefits mentioned in subparagraphs (1)(a)(i) and (ii), and the notional principal in relation to each leg, need not actually be provided or received.

    * (3) In applying this Subdivision to the *financial arrangement:

      * (a) work out the *financial benefits from the arrangement as follows:

        * (i) work out the financial benefits from each thing of which the arrangement consists separately from the financial benefits from each other thing of which the arrangement consists;

        * (ii) ensure that results under subparagraph (i) are consistent with the timing and amount of financial benefits to be actually provided or received under the arrangement; and

      * (b) work out your gains and losses from the arrangement as follows:

        * (i) work out the gains and losses from each thing of which the arrangement consists separately from the gains and losses from each other thing of which the arrangement consists;

        * (ii) treat the gains and losses mentioned in subparagraph (i) for all of those things as your gains and losses from the arrangement; and

      * (c) in working out a gain or loss from a thing for the purposes of subparagraph (b)(i), and, if the accruals method applies to the gain or loss, how it is to be spread and allocated:

        * (i) if the thing is a leg--take into account the amount of the notional principal at a time and in a manner that properly reflects the way in which the financial benefits in respect of that leg are calculated; and

        * (ii) if the thing is _not _a leg--take into account an amount relevant to the thing at a time and in a manner that properly reflects the way in which the financial benefits in respect of that thing are calculated.

##### The accruals method

##### 230125  Overview of the accruals method

    * If the accruals method applies to a gain or loss you have from a *financial arrangement:

      * (a) you use section 230130 to work out the period over which the gain or loss is to be spread; and

      * (b) you use section 230135 to work out how to allocate the gain or loss to particular intervals within the period over which the gain or loss is to be spread; and

      * (c) if an interval to which part of the gain or loss is allocated straddles 2 income years, you use section 230170 to work out how to allocate that part of the gain or loss allocated between those 2 income years.

##### 230130  Applying accruals method to work out period over which gain or loss is to be spread

    * Period over which overall gain or loss is to be spread

    * (1) If you have a sufficiently certain overall gain or loss from a *financial arrangement under subsection 230105(1), the period over which the gain or loss is to be spread is the period that:

      * (a) starts when you start to have the arrangement; and

      * (b) ends when you will cease to have the arrangement.

    * In applying paragraph (b), you must assume that you will continue to have the arrangement for the rest of its life.

    * Period over which particular gain or loss is to be spread

    * (3) If you have a sufficiently certain gain or loss from a *financial arrangement under subsection 230110(1), the period over which the gain or loss is to be spread is the period to which the gain or loss relates. Have regard to the pricing, terms and conditions of the arrangement in working out the period to which the gain or loss relates. This subsection has effect subject to subsections (4) and (5).

    * (4) The start of the period over which a gain or loss to which subsection (3) applies is to be spread must:

      * (a) not start earlier than the time when you start to have the *financial arrangement; and

      * (b) other than in the case of a gain or loss to which subsection 230100(3A) or subsection (4A) of this section applies--not start earlier than the start of the income year during which it becomes sufficiently certain that you will make the gain or loss.

    * (4A) This subsection applies to a gain or loss to which subsection (3) applies, if:

      * (a) there is an impairment (within the meaning of the *accounting principles) of:

        * (i) the *financial arrangement; or

        * (ii) a financial asset or financial liability that forms part of the arrangement; and

      * (b) because of the impairment, you make a reassessment under section 230185 in relation to the arrangement; and

      * (c) you determine on the reassessment that the gain or loss is not sufficiently certain (whether or not the gain or loss was sufficiently certain before the reassessment); and

      * (d) there is a reversal of the impairment loss (within the meaning of the accounting principles) that resulted from the impairment; and

      * (e) because of the reversal, you make a reassessment under section 230185 in relation to the arrangement; and

      * (f) you determine on the reassessment that the gain or loss has become sufficiently certain.

          * Note: For the income years to which the gain or loss is allocated, see section 230170.

    * (5) The end of the period over which a gain or loss to which subsection (3) applies is to be spread must not end later than the time when you will cease to have the *financial arrangement.

##### 230135  How gain or loss is spread

    * How to spread gain or loss

    * (1) This section tells you how to spread a gain or loss to which the accruals method applies.

    * Compounding accruals or approximation

    * (2) The gain or loss is to be spread using:

      * (a) compounding accruals; or

      * (b) a method whose results approximate those obtained using the method referred to in paragraph (a) (having regard to the length of the period over which the gain or loss is to be spread).

    * (3) The following subsections of this section clarify the way in which the gain or loss is to be spread in accordance with paragraph (2)(a).

    * Intervals to which parts of gain or loss allocated

    * (4) The intervals to which parts of the gain or loss are allocated must:

      * (a) not exceed 12 months; and

      * (b) all be of the same length.

    * Paragraph (b) does not apply to the first and last intervals. These may be shorter than the other intervals.

    * Fixing of amount and rate for interval

    * (5) For each interval:

      * (a) determine a rate of return; and

      * (b) determine an amount to which you apply the rate of return.

    * (6) For the purposes of paragraph (5)(b), in determining the amount to which you apply the rate of return for an interval, have regard to:

      * (a) the amount or value; and

      * (b) the timing;

    * of *financial benefits that are to be taken into account in working out the amount of the gain or loss, and were provided or received by you during the interval.

    * (6A) However, if there is only one *financial benefit that is to be taken into account in working out the amount of the gain or loss, then, for the purposes of paragraph (5)(b), in determining the amount to which you apply the rate of return, have regard to a notional principal:

      * (a) by reference to which the financial benefit is calculated; or

      * (b) which is reasonably related to the financial benefit.

    * Assumption of continuing to hold arrangement for rest of its life

    * (7) The gain or loss is to be spread assuming that you will continue to have the *financial arrangement for the rest of its life.

    * Regard to be had to financial benefits provided or received in interval

    * (8) In allocating the gain or loss to intervals, have regard to the *financial benefits to be provided or received in each of those intervals.

##### 230140  Method of spreading gain or loss--effective interest method

    * (1) This section clarifies that the method mentioned in subsection (2) of spreading gains and losses is a method covered by paragraph 230135(2)(b) (methods approximating compounding accruals).

    * (2) The method is the effective interest method mentioned in *accounting standard AASB 139 (or another accounting standard prescribed by the regulations for the purposes of this subsection).

    * (3) However, this section applies to a particular *financial arrangement you have only if:

      * (a) in a case where there is a discount or premium under the arrangement--when you start to have the arrangement, the annually compounded rate of return applicable to the discount or premium does not exceed 1%; and

      * (b) when you start to have the arrangement, neither the maximum life of the arrangement (as determined under the terms and conditions of the arrangement) nor the expected life of the arrangement exceeds:

        * (i) unless subparagraph (ii) applies--30 years; or

        * (ii) if the regulations prescribe a different period for the purposes of this subparagraph--that period; and

      * (c) each *financial benefit that you have an obligation to provide or a right to receive under the arrangement, and that gives rise to a gain or loss from the arrangement (other than a gain or loss that is attributable to any discount or premium):

        * (i) relates to a period not exceeding 12 months; and

        * (ii) is to be provided or received in the period to which it relates; and

           * Note: Different financial benefits may relate to different periods.

      * (d) you prepare a financial report for the year in which you start to have the arrangement; and

      * (e) that financial report is:

        * (i) prepared in accordance with paragraph 230210(2)(a); and

        * (ii) audited in accordance with paragraph 230210(2)(b); and

      * (f) all gains and losses from the arrangement to which the accrual method applies are spread in a way that is consistent with that financial report.

    * (4) For the purposes of paragraph (3)(a), assume that you will continue to have the arrangement for the rest of its expected life.

##### 230145  Application of effective interest method where differing income and accounting years

    * (1) This section applies if:

      * (a) you prepare a financial report for a year (the **_first year_**); and

      * (c) your income year starts in the first year and ends in the second year; and

      * (d) both the financial report for the first year and the financial report for the second year are:

        * (i) prepared in accordance with paragraph 230210(2)(a); and

        * (ii) audited in accordance with paragraph 230210(2)(b); and

      * (e) the auditor's reports are unqualified for both the financial report for the first year and the financial report for the second year.

    * (2) For the purposes of paragraph 230140(3)(d), treat yourself as having prepared a financial report for the income year in which you start to have the arrangement.

    * (3) Work out the gain or loss you make from the arrangement for the income year as follows:

        * (iii) if one of the amounts worked out under paragraphs (b) and (d) is a loss and the other is a gain--subtract the loss from the gain. If the result is positive, this is the gain from the arrangement for the income year. If the result is negative, this is the loss from the arrangement for the income year.

    * (4) For the purposes of paragraphs (3)(b) and (d), work out how much of the gain or loss is attributable to the income year by:

      * (a) using a methodology that is reasonable; and

      * (b) using the same methodology for the first and second years.

      * (c) the method can be justified objectively; and

      * (d) the method is reasonable in the circumstances.

    * (5) To avoid doubt, subsections (3) and (4) apply despite sections 230130 and 230135.

##### 230165  Portfolio treatment of premiums and discounts for acquiring portfolio

##### 230170  Allocating gain or loss to income years

    * (1) You are taken, for the purposes of section 23015, to make, for an income year, a gain or loss equal to a part of a gain or loss if:

      * (a) that part of the gain or loss is allocated to an interval under section 230135; and

      * (b) that interval falls wholly within that income year.

    * (2) If:

      * (a) a part of a gain or loss is allocated to an interval under section 230135; and

      * (b) that interval straddles 2 income years;

    * you are taken, for purposes of section 23015, to make a gain or loss equal to so much of that part of the gain or loss as is allocated between those income years on a reasonable basis.

    * (2A) Subsections (1) and (2) do not apply to a part of a gain or loss if:

      * (a) subsection 230100(3A) or 230130(4A) applies to the gain or loss; and

      * (b) when you receive the benefit (or the time comes for you to receive the benefit), the amount you receive (or are to receive) is nil or is less than the amount estimated.

    * The amount of the loss is equal to the difference between the amount estimated and the amount you receive (or are to receive). You are taken to have made the loss for the income year in which you receive the benefit (or in which the time comes for you to receive the benefit).

    * (1A) Subsection (1) does not apply to the extent that the difference results from:

      * (a) an impairment (within the meaning of the *accounting principles) of:

##### Realisation method

##### 230180  Realisation method

    * (1) If a gain or loss is to be taken into account using the realisation method, you are taken, for the purposes of section 23015, to make the gain or loss for the income year in which the gain or loss occurs.

          * Note: Sections 23070 and 23075 allow you to apportion financial benefits provided and financial benefits received in working out the amount of the gain or loss.

    * (2) For the purposes of subsection (1), a gain or loss from a *financial arrangement is taken to occur at:

      * (a) if the last of the *financial benefits, rights and obligations taken into account in determining the amount of the gain or loss is a financial benefit--the time the financial benefit:

        * (i) is provided; or

        * (ii) if the financial benefit is not provided at the time when it is due to be provided under the arrangement and it is reasonable to expect that the financial benefit will be provided--is due to be provided; or

      * (b) if the last of the financial benefits, rights and obligations taken into account in determining the amount of the gain or loss is a right to receive a financial benefit or an obligation to provide a financial benefit--the time:

        * (i) if the right or obligation ceases before the financial benefit is provided--the right or obligation ceases; or

        * (ii) otherwise--the financial benefit is provided.

    * This subsection has effect subject to subsection (3).

    * (3) For the purposes of subsection (1), you make a loss from a *financial arrangement from writing off, as a bad debt, a right to a *financial benefit (or a part of a financial benefit) if:

      * (a) the financial benefit was taken into account in working out the amount of a gain from the arrangement and the gain has been included in your assessable income under this Division; or

      * (b) the right is one in respect of money that you lent in the ordinary course of your *business of lending money; or

      * (c) the right is one that you bought in the ordinary course of your business of lending money.

    * (4) The loss referred to in subsection (3) occurs when you write off the right to the *financial benefit (or the part of the financial benefit) as a bad debt.

    * (5) The amount of the loss referred to in subsection (3) is:

      * (a) if paragraph (3)(a) applies--so much of the gain referred to in that paragraph as is reasonably attributable to the *financial benefit (or the part of the financial benefit); or

      * (b) if paragraph (3)(b) applies--the amount of the financial benefit (or the part of the financial benefit); or

      * (c) if paragraph (3)(c) applies--the amount of the financial benefit (or the part of the financial benefit) but only up to the value of the financial benefit you provided to acquire the right to the financial benefit (or the part of the financial benefit).

    * (6) For the purposes of this Act, a deduction for the loss referred to in subsection (3) is to be treated as a deduction of a bad debt.

          * Note: Various provisions in this Act and the _Income Tax Assessment Act 1936_ restrict the availability of deductions for bad debts and make provision in relation to the recoupment of amounts in relation to bad debts that have been written off. These provisions are set out in subsection 2535(5).

##### Reassessment and reestimation

##### 230185  Reassessment

    * (1) You must make a fresh assessment of which gains and losses from a *financial arrangement the accruals method should apply to, and which gains and losses from that arrangement the realisation method should apply to, if:

      * (a) the accruals method, or the realisation method, provided for in this Subdivision applies to gains and losses from the arrangement; and

      * (b) there is a material change to:

        * (i) the terms and conditions of the arrangement; or

        * (ii) circumstances that affect the arrangement.

    * (2) Without limiting subsection (1), the following changes are material changes to the terms and conditions of, or circumstances that affect, the *financial arrangement:

      * (a) a change to the terms or conditions of the arrangement in a way that alters the essential nature of the arrangement (for example, by altering it from a *debt interest to an *equity interest or from an equity interest to a debt interest);

      * (b) a change to the terms or conditions of the arrangement in a way that materially affects the contingencies on which significant obligations and rights under the arrangement are dependent (for example, by introducing such a contingency or removing such a contingency);

      * (c) a change in circumstances that makes something that:

        * (i) materially affects significant obligations and rights under the arrangement; and

        * (ii) was previously dependent on a contingency;

      * no longer dependent on a contingency (because, for example, only one of a number of previously possible contingencies is realised);

      * (d) a change to:

        * (i) the terms on which credit is to be provided to an entity that is not a party to the arrangement; or

        * (ii) the credit rating of an entity that is not a party to the arrangement;

      * if a significant obligation or right under the arrangement is dependent on that credit being provided or that rating being maintained;

      * (e) if the arrangement is, or includes, a financial asset or financial liability and you prepare your financial reports in accordance with:

        * (i) the *accounting principles; or

        * (ii) if the accounting principles do not apply to the preparation of the financial report--comparable standards for accounting made under a *foreign law that apply to the preparation of the financial report under a foreign law;

      * a change to the terms or conditions of, or circumstances that affect, the arrangement that are sufficient for the financial asset or financial liability to be treated as impaired for the purposes of those principles or standards.

    * (3) You do not need to make a reassessment under this section merely because of a change in the fair value of the *financial arrangement.

##### 230190  Reestimation

    * When reestimation necessary

    * (1) You reestimate a gain or loss from a *financial arrangement under subsection (5) if:

      * (a) the accruals method applies to the gain or loss; and

      * (b) circumstances arise that materially affect:

        * (i) the amount or value; or

        * (ii) the timing;

      * of *financial benefits that were taken into account in working out the amount of the gain or loss; and

      * (c) the circumstances do not give rise to a reestimation under section 230200.

    * (2) You must reestimate the gain or loss as soon as reasonably practicable after you become aware of the circumstances referred to in paragraph (1)(b), if subsection (1) applies.

    * (3) Without limiting subsection (1), the following are circumstances of the kind referred to in paragraph (1)(b):

      * (a) a material change in market conditions that are relevant to the amount or value of the *financial benefits to be received or provided under the *financial arrangement;

      * (b) cash flows that were previously estimated becoming known and the difference between the cash flows that become known and the cash flows that were previously estimates is not insignificant;

      * (c) a right to, or a part of a right to, a financial benefit under the arrangement is written off as a bad debt;

      * (d) you have made a reassessment under section 230185 in relation to gains or losses under the arrangement and you have determined on the reassessment under that section that the accruals method should continue to apply to those gains or losses.

    * (3A) You also reestimate a gain or loss from a *financial arrangement under subsection (5) if:

      * (a) the gain or loss is spread using the method referred to in paragraph 230135(2)(b) in accordance with section 230140 (effective interest method); and

      * (b) you recalculate the effective interest rate in accordance with that method; and

      * (c) the terms and conditions of the arrangement provide for reset dates to occur no more than 12 months apart; and

      * (d) the maximum life of the arrangement (as determined under the terms and conditions of the arrangement) is more than 12 months.

    * (3B) You must reestimate the gain or loss at the relevant reset date if subsection (3A) applies.

    * (4) You do not reestimate the gain or loss from a *financial arrangement under subsection (5) merely because of a change in the credit rating, or the creditworthiness, of a party or parties to the arrangement.

    * Nature of reestimation

    * (5) Making a reestimation in relation to a gain or loss under this subsection involves:

      * (a) a fresh determination of the amount of the gain or loss; and

      * (b) a reapplication of the accruals method to the redetermined gain or loss to make a fresh allocation of the part of the redetermined gain or loss that has not already been allocated to intervals ending before the reestimation is made to intervals ending after the reestimation is made.

    * Basis for reestimation

    * (6) You may make the fresh allocation of the gain or loss under subsection (5) on these bases:

      * (a) if you satisfy subsection (7) in relation to the *financial arrangement--by maintaining the rate of return being used and adjusting the amount to which you apply the rate of return to the present value of the estimated future cash flows discounted at the maintained rate of return;

      * (b) in any case--by adjusting the rate of return and maintaining the amount to which the adjusted rate of return is to be applied.

    * The object to be achieved by both bases is to allow you to bring the remainder of the gain or loss based on the new estimates properly to account over the remainder of the period over which you spread the gain or loss.

          * Note: The amount referred to in paragraph (b) is the amount to which the previous rate of return was being applied immediately before the reestimation.

    * (7) You satisfy this subsection in relation to a *financial arrangement if every reestimation you make under subsection (5) in relation to a gain or loss from the arrangement is made in accordance with:

      * (a) financial reports of the kind referred to in paragraph 230395(2)(a) that are audited as referred to in paragraph 230395(2)(b) (regardless of whether Subdivision 230F (reliance on financial reports method) is to apply to a particular financial arrangement); and

      * (b) *accounting standard AASB 139 (or another accounting standard prescribed by the regulations for the purposes of this paragraph).

##### 230192  Reestimation--impairments and reversals

    * (1) This section applies if the reestimation mentioned in section 230190 arises because of:

      * (a) an impairment (within the meaning of the *accounting principles) of:

        * (i) the *financial arrangement; or

        * (ii) a financial asset or financial liability that forms part of the arrangement; or

      * (b) a reversal of an impairment loss (within the meaning of the accounting principles) that resulted from such an impairment.

    * (2) Despite paragraph 230190(6)(a), you must make the fresh allocation in accordance with paragraph 230190(6)(b).

    * Losses nondeductible

    * (3) You cannot deduct a loss you make for an income year under section 23015, to the extent that the loss results from:

      * (a) the impairment (including as affected by any later reversal of the impairment loss that resulted from the impairment); or

      * (b) the operation of subsection (7).

    * (4) Disregard subsection (3) for the purposes of paragraph (c) of step 1 of the method statement in subsection 230445(1).

    * Reversals

    * (5) Subsections (7) and (8) apply to the part of the gain or loss that is to be reallocated in accordance with paragraph 230190(6)(b), if:

      * (a) the fresh determination under paragraph 230190(5)(a) that arose because of the reversal resulted in that part being a gain; and

      * (b) there are losses that:

        * (i) resulted from the impairment; and

        * (ii) you could have deducted apart from subsection 230172(2) or subsection (3) of this section.

    * (6) Paragraph (5)(b) does not apply to a loss to the extent that:

      * (a) the loss reflects the amount of a loss you make under paragraph 230195(1)(b) or (c); and

      * (b) the loss you make under paragraph 230195(1)(b) or (c) relates to you writing off, as a bad debt, a right to receive a *financial benefit (or a part of a financial benefit).

    * (7) Treat the fresh determination as having resulted in that part being a loss, if the total of the losses mentioned in paragraph (5)(b) of this section exceeds the amount of the gain mentioned in paragraph (5)(a). The amount of the loss is equal to the amount of the excess.

    * (8) Otherwise, reduce the amount of that gain by the total of those losses.

##### 230195  Balancing adjustment if rate of return maintained on reestimation

    * (1) If you make a fresh allocation of the gain or loss on the basis referred to in paragraph 230190(6)(a), you must make the following balancing adjustment:

      * (a) if you reestimate a gain and the amount to which you apply the rate of return increases--you make a gain from the *financial arrangement, for the income year in which you make the reestimation, equal to the amount of the increase;

      * (b) if you reestimate a gain and the amount to which you apply the rate of return decreases--you make a loss from the arrangement, for the income year in which you make the reestimation, equal to the amount of the decrease;

      * (c) if you reestimate a loss and the amount to which you apply the rate of return increases--you make a loss from the arrangement, for the income year in which you make the reestimation, equal to the amount of the increase;

      * (d) if you reestimate a loss and the amount to which you apply the rate of return decreases--you make a gain from the arrangement, for the income year in which you make the reestimation, equal to the amount of the decrease.

    * (2) Subsection (3) applies if:

      * (a) the reestimation is made wholly or partly on the basis that you have written off, as a bad debt, a right to receive a *financial benefit (or a part of a financial benefit); and

      * (b) the right:

        * (i) is not one in respect of money that you lent in the ordinary course of your *business of lending money; and

        * (ii) is not one that you bought in the ordinary course of your business of lending money.

    * (3) The balancing adjustment to be made under paragraph (1)(b), to the extent that it relates to the writing off of the bad debt, must not exceed so much of the gain in relation to the *financial arrangement as:

      * (a) has been assessed under this Division; and

      * (b) is reasonably attributable to the *financial benefit (or the part of the financial benefit).

    * (4) Subsection (5) applies if:

      * (a) the reestimation is made wholly or partly on the basis that you have written off, as a bad debt, a right to receive a *financial benefit; and

      * (b) the right is one that you bought in the ordinary course of your *business of lending money.

    * (5) The balancing adjustment to be made under paragraph (1)(b), to the extent that it relates to the writing off of the bad debt, must not exceed the value of the *financial benefit you provided to acquire the right to the financial benefit (or the part of the financial benefit).

    * (6) For the purposes of this Act, a deduction for the balancing adjustment referred to in subsection (3) is to be treated as a deduction of a bad debt.

          * Note: Various provisions in this Act and the _Income Tax Assessment Act 1936_ restrict the availability of deductions for bad debts and make provision in relation to the recoupment of amounts in relation to bad debts that have been written off. These provisions are set out in subsection 2535(5).

##### 230200  Reestimation if balancing adjustment on partial disposal

    * Reestimation if balancing adjustment on partial disposal

    * (1) You also reestimate a gain or loss from a *financial arrangement under subsection (2) if:

      * (a) the accruals method applies to the gain or loss; and

      * (b) a balancing adjustment is made in relation to the arrangement under Subdivision 230G because you transfer to another entity:

        * (i) a proportionate share of all of your rights and/or obligations under the arrangement; or

        * (ii) a right or obligation that you have under the arrangement to a specifically identified *financial benefit; or

        * (iii) a proportionate share of a right or obligation that you have under the arrangement to a specifically identified financial benefit.

    * You must reestimate the gain or loss as soon as reasonably practicable after the transfer occurs.

    * Nature of reestimation

    * (2) Making a reestimation in relation to a gain or loss under this subsection involves:

      * (a) a fresh determination of the amount of the gain or loss disregarding:

        * (i) *financial benefits; and

        * (ii) amounts of the gain or loss that have already been allocated to intervals ending before the reestimation is made;

      * to the extent to which they are reasonably attributable to the proportionate share, or the right or obligation, referred to in paragraph (1)(b); and

      * (b) a reapplication of the accruals method to the redetermined gain or loss to make a fresh allocation of the part of that gain or loss that has not already been allocated to intervals ending before the reestimation is made to intervals ending after the reestimation is made.

    * Basis for reestimation

    * (3) You make the fresh allocation of the gain or loss under subsection (2) by maintaining the rate of return being used and adjusting the amount to which you apply the rate of return to the present value of the estimated future cash flows discounted at the maintained rate of return. The object to be achieved by the fresh allocation is to allow you to bring the redetermined gain or loss properly to account over the remainder of the period over which you spread the gain or loss.

##### 230210  Fair value election

    * Election

    * (1) You may make a **_fair value election_** under this section if you are eligible under subsection (2) to make the election for the income year in which you make the election.

    * Eligibility to make fair value election for an income year

    * (2) You are eligible to make a **_fair value election_** for an income year if:

      * (a) you prepare a financial report for that income year in accordance with:

        * (i) the *accounting principles; or

        * (ii) if the accounting principles do not apply to the preparation of the financial report--comparable standards for accounting made under a *foreign law that apply to the preparation of the financial report under a foreign law; and

      * (b) the financial report is audited in accordance with:

        * (i) the *auditing principles; or

        * (ii) if the auditing principles do not apply to the auditing of the financial report--comparable standards for auditing made under a foreign law.

          * Note: Section 230500 allows regulations to be made specifying particular foreign accounting and auditing standards as ones that are to be treated as comparable with Australian accounting and auditing principles for the purposes of this Division.

    * Election irrevocable

    * (3) A *fair value election is irrevocable.

          * Note: The election may cease to have effect, or cease to apply to a particular financial arrangement, under section 230240.

##### 230215  Fair value election where differing income and accounting years

    * (1) This section applies if:

      * (a) you prepare a financial report for a year (the **_first year_**); and

      * (b) you prepare a financial report for the subsequent year (the **_second year_**); and

      * (c) your income year starts in the first year and ends in the second year; and

      * (d) both the financial report for the first year and the financial report for the second year are:

        * (i) prepared in accordance with paragraph 230210(2)(a); and

        * (ii) audited in accordance with paragraph 230210(2)(b); and

      * (e) the auditor's reports are unqualified for both the financial report for the first year and the financial report for the second year.

    * (2) Treat yourself as eligible to make an election for the income year under subsection 230210(2).

    * (3) Work out the gain or loss you make from the *financial arrangement for the income year as follows:

      * (a) firstly, work out the gain or loss you make from the arrangement for the first year in accordance with section 230230 (treating the first year as an income year);

      * (b) next, work out how much of the gain or loss mentioned in paragraph (a) is attributable to the income year in accordance with subsection (4);

      * (c) next, work out the gain or loss you make from the arrangement for the second year in accordance with section 230230 (treating the second year as an income year);

      * (d) next, work out how much of the gain or loss mentioned in paragraph (c) is attributable to the income year in accordance with subsection (4);

      * (e) next:

        * (i) if the amounts worked out under paragraphs (b) and (d) are both gains--add them together to work out the gain from the arrangement for the income year; or

        * (ii) if the amounts worked out under paragraphs (b) and (d) are both losses--add them together to work out the loss from the arrangement for the income year; or

        * (iii) if one of the amounts worked out under paragraphs (b) and (d) is a loss and the other is a gain--subtract the loss from the gain. If the result is positive, this is the gain from the arrangement for the income year. If the result is negative, this is the loss from the arrangement for the income year.

    * (4) For the purposes of paragraphs (3)(b) and (d), work out how much of the gain or loss is attributable to the income year by:

      * (a) using a methodology that is reasonable; and

      * (b) using the same methodology for the first and second years.

    * (5) For the purposes of paragraph (4)(a), treat a methodology that attributes the gain or loss on a prorata basis as _not _being reasonable.

##### 230220  Financial arrangements to which fair value election applies

    * (1) A *fair value election applies in relation to *financial arrangements that:

      * (a) are *Division 230 financial arrangements; and

      * (b) are recognised in financial reports of the kind referred to in paragraph 230210(2)(a) that are audited, or required to be audited, as referred to in paragraph 230210(2)(b); and

      * (c) are assets or liabilities that you are required (whether or not as a result of a choice you make) by:

        * (i) the *accounting principles; or

        * (ii) if the accounting principles do not apply to the preparation of the financial report--comparable standards for accounting that apply to the preparation of the financial report under a *foreign law;

      * to classify, designate or (in whole or in part) otherwise treat, in the financial reports, as at fair value through profit or loss; and

      * (d) you start to have in the income year in which you make the election or in a later income year.

    * This subsection has effect subject to section 230225.

    * (2) If, but for this subsection, paragraphs (1)(b) and (c) would not be satisfied in relation to a *financial arrangement because the arrangement is an intragroup transaction for the purposes of:

      * (a) *accounting standard AASB 127 (or another accounting standard prescribed by the regulations for the purposes of this paragraph); or

      * (b) if that standard does not apply to the preparation of the financial report--a comparable accounting standard that applies to the preparation of the financial report under a *foreign law;

    * paragraphs (1)(b) and (c) are taken to be satisfied in relation to the arrangement.

          * Note: Financial arrangements between members of a consolidated group or MEC group are not covered by this subsection because the single entity rule in subsection 7011(1) operates to treat them as not being financial arrangements for the purposes of this Division.

    * (3) If:

      * (a) the *financial arrangement would not be a financial arrangement if the following provisions were disregarded:

        * (i) Division 9A of Part III of the _Income Tax Assessment Act 1936 _(which deals with offshore banking units);

        * (ii) Part IIIB of that Act (which deals with Australian branches of foreign banks etc.); and

      * (b) paragraphs (1)(b) and (c) would be satisfied in relation to the financial arrangement if the arrangement had been between 2 separate entities; and

      * (c) the *fair value election is made by:

        * (i) if section 121EB of the _Income Tax Assessment Act 1936 _applies--the OBU mentioned in that section (disregarding the operation of that section); or

        * (ii) if section 160ZZW of that Act applies--the bank mentioned in that section (disregarding the operation of that section);

    * paragraphs (1)(b) and (c) are taken to be satisfied in relation to the arrangement.

##### 230225  Financial arrangements to which election does not apply

    * (1) A *fair value election does not apply to a *financial arrangement if:

      * (a) the arrangement is an *equity interest; and

      * (b) you are the issuer of the equity interest.

    * (2) A *fair value election does not apply to a *financial arrangement if:

      * (a) you are:

        * (i) an individual; or

        * (ii) an entity (other than an individual) that satisfies subsection 230455(2), (3) or (4) for the income year in which you start to have the arrangement; and

      * (b) the arrangement is a *qualifying security; and

      * (c) you have not made an election under subsection 230455(7).

    * (3) A *fair value election does not apply to a *financial arrangement if:

      * (a) the election is made by the *head company of a *consolidated group or *MEC group; and

      * (b) the election specifies that the election is not to apply to financial arrangements in relation to *life insurance business carried on by a member of the consolidated group or MEC group; and

      * (c) the arrangement is one that relates to the life insurance business carried on by a member of the consolidated group or MEC group.

    * (4) A *fair value election does not apply to a *financial arrangement if the arrangement is associated with a business of a kind specified in regulations made for the purposes of this subsection.

##### 230230  Applying fair value method to gains and losses

    * (1) You make a gain or loss for an income year from a *financial arrangement to which a *fair value election applies if:

      * (a) the principles or standards mentioned in paragraph 230210(2)(a) require you to recognise a gain or loss in profit or loss for the income year from the asset or liability mentioned in paragraph 230220(1)(c); or

      * (b) in the case of an arrangement to which subsection 230220(2) applies--the principles or standards referred to in paragraph 230220(1)(c) would have required you to recognise a gain or loss in profit or loss for the year from the asset or liability mentioned in paragraph 230220(1)(c) if the arrangement had not been an intragroup transaction for the purposes of the standard referred to in paragraph 230220(2)(b); or

      * (c) in the case of an arrangement to which subsection 230220(3) applies--the principles or standards referred to in paragraph 230220(1)(c) would have required you to recognise a gain or loss in profit or loss for the year from the asset or liability mentioned in paragraph 230220(1)(c) if the arrangement had been between 2 separate entities.

          * Note: Subsection 23040(7) provides that an election under Subdivision 230E (hedging financial arrangements method) or Subdivision 230F (method of relying on financial reports) may override a fair value election.

    * (1A) The gain or loss you make is the gain or loss the principles or standards require, or would have required, you to recognise in profit or loss as mentioned in subsection (1).

    * (2) Subsection (3) applies if:

      * (a) a *head company of a *consolidated group or *MEC group has a *financial arrangement; and

      * (b) a *fair value election applies to the arrangement; and

      * (c) a subsidiary member of the group ceases to be a member of the group at a particular time (the **_leaving time_**); and

      * (d) immediately after the leaving time, the head company no longer has the arrangement because the subsidiary member ceased to be a member of the group.

    * (3) The gain or loss the group makes from the arrangement for the income year in which the leaving time occurs is taken to be the gain or loss that the principles or standards referred to in paragraph 230210(2)(a) would require the group to recognise as at fair value through profit or loss for the income year from the asset or liability mentioned in paragraph 230220(1)(c) if:

      * (a) the circumstances that existed in relation to the arrangement (including its value) immediately before the leaving time had continued to exist until the end of the income year; and

      * (b) any circumstances that arise in relation to the financial arrangement after the leaving time were disregarded.

    * Subdivision does not apply to extent gains or losses not recognised as at fair value

    * (4) This Subdivision does not apply to a gain or loss you make from the *financial arrangement, to the extent:

      * (a) you are required, as mentioned in paragraph 230220(1)(c), to otherwise treat as at fair value through profit and loss the assets or liabilities that the financial arrangement is; and

      * (b) the principles or standards referred to in paragraph 230210(2)(a) do not require you to recognise the gain or loss as at fair value through profit or loss.

          * Note: See also subsection 23040(5).

##### 230235  Splitting financial arrangements into 2 financial arrangements

    * (1) If:

      * (a) a *financial arrangement is constituted only in part by an asset or liability mentioned in paragraph 230220(1)(c); and

      * (b) a *fair value election would apply to the arrangement if it were constituted solely by that asset or liability;

    * the provisions of this Division (other than this section) apply to the arrangement as if it were instead 2 separate financial arrangements.

    * (2) The 2 separate *financial arrangements are:

    * (2) Subsection (1) does not prevent you from making a new *fair value election at a later time if you become, at that later time, eligible under subsection 230210(2) to make a fair value election for an income year.

          * Note: The new election will only apply to financial arrangements you start to have after the start of the income year in which the new election is made.

    * (3) A *fair value election ceases to apply to a particular *financial arrangement from the start of an income year if the arrangement ceases to satisfy a requirement of paragraph 230220(1)(b) or (c) during that income year.

    * (4) If the election ceases to apply to a particular *financial arrangement under subsection (3), the election cannot subsequently reapply to that arrangement (even if the requirements of paragraphs 230220(1)(b) and (c) are satisfied once more in relation to the arrangement).

    * (3) You must make a balancing adjustment under subsection (4) if a *fair value election ceases to apply to a particular *financial arrangement under subsection 230240(3).

    * (4) The balancing adjustment under this subsection is the balancing adjustment you would make under Subdivision 230G if you disposed of the *financial arrangement for its fair value when the election ceases to apply to the arrangement.

    * (5) If a balancing adjustment is made under subsection (2) or (4) in relation to a *financial arrangement, you are taken, for the purposes of this Division, to have reacquired the arrangement at its fair value immediately after the election ceased to have effect or ceased to apply to the arrangement.

    * (6) In determining, for the purposes of the balancing adjustment under subsection (2) or (4) or for the purposes of subsection (5), the fair value of the *financial arrangement at a time, disregard any changes in the fair value to the extent that:

      * (a) you are required, as mentioned in paragraph 230220(1)(c), to otherwise treat the financial arrangement as at fair value through profit and loss; and

      * (b) the principles or standards referred to in paragraph 230210(2)(a) do not require you to recognise the changes as at fair value through profit or loss.

    * (2) Treat yourself as eligible to make an election for the income year under subsection 230255(2).

    * (3) Work out the gain or loss you make from the arrangement for the income year as follows:

      * (a) firstly, work out the gain or loss you make from the arrangement for the first year in accordance with section 230280 (treating the first year as an income year);

##### 230265  Financial arrangements to which general election applies

    * (1) A *foreign exchange retranslation election under subsection 230255(1) applies to each of your *financial arrangements:

      * (a) that are *Division 230 financial arrangements; and

      * (d) that you start to have in the income year in which you make the election or in a later income year.

    * This subsection has effect subject to section 230270.

          * Note: The election also has consequences under Subdivision 775F for arrangements that are not Division 230 financial arrangements.

    * (2) If, but for this subsection, paragraphs (1)(b) and (c) would not be satisfied in relation to a *financial arrangement because the arrangement is an intragroup transaction for the purposes of:

      * (b) if that standard does not apply to the preparation of the financial report--a comparable accounting standard that applies to the preparation of the financial report under a *foreign law;

    * paragraphs (1)(b) and (c) are taken to be satisfied in relation to the arrangement.

      * (c) the *foreign exchange retranslation election under subsection 230255(1) is made by:

        * (i) if section 121EB of the _Income Tax Assessment Act 1936 _applies--the OBU mentioned in that section (disregarding the operation of that section); or

        * (ii) if section 160ZZW of that Act applies--the bank mentioned in that section (disregarding the operation of that section);

        * (ii) an entity (other than an individual) that satisfies subsection 230455(2), (3) or (4) for the income year in which you start to have the arrangement; and

      * (b) the arrangement is a *qualifying security; and

      * (c) you have not made an election under subsection 230455(7).

    * (3) A *foreign exchange retranslation election under subsection 230255(1) does not apply to a *financial arrangement if:

      * (b) the election specifies that the election is not to apply to financial arrangements in relation to *life insurance business carried on by a member of the consolidated group or MEC group; and

      * (c) the arrangement is one that relates to the life insurance business carried on by a member of the consolidated group or MEC group.

    * (1) If you make a *foreign exchange retranslation election under subsection 230255(3) in relation to a *financial arrangement after you start to have the arrangement, you must make a balancing adjustment under subsection (2).

    * (2) The balancing adjustment under this subsection is the balancing adjustment you would make under Subdivision 230G if you ceased to have the arrangement for its fair value at the time when the election started to apply to the arrangement (but only to the extent to which the balancing adjustment is reasonably attributable to a *currency exchange rate effect).

##### 230280  Applying foreign exchange retranslation method to gains and losses

        * (iii) if subsection 230265(3) applies to the arrangement--the standard referred to in paragraph 230265(1)(c) would have required you to recognise a particular amount in profit or loss for the year that is attributable to currency exchange rates mentioned in paragraph 230265(1)(c) if the arrangement had been between 2 separate entities.

    * The amount of the gain or loss is the amount the standard requires, or would have required, you to recognise.

    * Election in relation to qualifying forex accounts

    * (2) You make a gain or loss from a *financial arrangement for an income year if:

    * The amount of the gain or loss is the amount the standard requires, or would require, you to recognise.

    * (4) The gain or loss the group makes from the *financial arrangement for the income year in which the leaving time occurs is taken to be the gain or loss that the standard referred to in paragraph 230265(1)(c) would require the group to recognise in profit or loss in relation to the arrangement for that income year if:

      * (a) the circumstances that existed in relation to the arrangement (including its value) immediately before the leaving time had continued to exist until the end of the income year; and

      * (b) any circumstances that arise in relation to the arrangement after the leaving time were disregarded.

    * (2) Subsection (1) does not prevent you from making a new *foreign exchange retranslation election at a later time if you become, at that later time, eligible under subsection 230255(2), to make a foreign exchange retranslation election under subsection 230255(1) for that income year.

##### 230295  Objects of this Subdivision

    * The objects of this Subdivision are: 

      * (a) to facilitate the efficient management of financial risk by reducing aftertax mismatches and better aligning tax treatment where hedging takes place; and

      * (b) to minimise tax deferral and tax motivated practices (including tax deferral arising from such practices as tax advantaged selection from among possible hedges and inappropriate selection of tax treatment).

##### 230300  Applying hedging financial arrangement method to gains and losses

    * (1) If you have a *hedging financial arrangement to which a *hedging financial arrangement election applies, the gain or loss you make for an income year from the arrangement is worked out under this section and section 230310 instead of under Subdivision 230B, 230C, 230D, 230F or 230G.

    * (2) Except where subsection (5) applies, the gain or loss you make from the *hedging financial arrangement is equal to the overall gain or loss you make from the arrangement.

    * (3) The gain or loss you make from the *hedging financial arrangement is allocated over income years according to the determination referred to in subsection 230360(1).

          * Note 1: The allocation is capable of extending to income years after you cease to have the hedging financial arrangement (see subsection 230360(3)).

          * Note 2: The determination must be included in the record made under section 230355.

    * (4) If the *hedging financial arrangement is a *foreign currency hedge and is a *debt interest, split a gain or loss you make from the arrangement as follows:

      * (a) to the extent to which the gain or loss represents a *currency exchange rate effect attributable to the outstanding balance in relation to the debt interest, treat it as a separate gain or loss to which subsections (1) and (2) apply;

      * (b) to the extent that it does not represent that effect, treat it as a separate gain or loss from the financial arrangement that is allocated under Subdivision 230B, 230F or 230G.

    * (5) If an event listed in the table in subsection 230305(1) occurs:

      * (a) the gain or loss you make from the *hedging financial arrangement is equal to any gain or loss that you would have made:

        * (i) while the arrangement was hedging the *hedged item or items; and

        * (ii) on ceasing to have the arrangement;

      * if you ceased to have the arrangement for its fair value at the time of the event; and

      * (b) this Division further applies as if, just after the event, you had acquired the arrangement for its fair value at the time of the event.

    * Despite subsection (3), the gain or loss referred to in paragraph (a) is allocated over income years according to the table.

    * (7) Subsection (8) applies if the *hedging financial arrangement:

      * (a) is a *financial arrangement under section 23050 (equity interests etc.); and

      * (b) is a *foreign currency hedge; and

      * (c) is one that you issue.

    * (8) Split a gain or loss you make from the arrangement as follows:

      * (a) to the extent to which the gain or loss represents a *currency exchange rate effect, treat it as a separate gain or loss to which subsections (1) and (2) apply;

      * (b) to the extent that it does not represent that effect, treat it as a separate gain or loss from the financial arrangement to which this Division does not apply.

    * (9) Subsections (10) and (11) apply if:

      * (a) a *head company of a *consolidated group or *MEC group has a *hedging financial arrangement; and

      * (b) a *hedging financial arrangement election applies to the arrangement; and

      * (c) a subsidiary member of the group ceases to be a member of the group at a particular time (the **_leaving time_**); and

      * (d) immediately after the leaving time:

        * (i) the head company no longer has the arrangement because the subsidiary member ceased to be a member of the group; and

        * (ii) the head company no longer has the *hedged item (or all of the hedged items) because the subsidiary member ceased to be a member of the group.

    * (10) The gain or loss the group makes from the arrangement for the income year in which the leaving time occurs is taken to be the gain or loss that would be allocated to the group in accordance with this section (disregarding subsection (5)) if:

      * (a) the circumstances that existed in relation to the arrangement (including its value) immediately before the leaving time had continued to exist until the end of the income year; and

      * (b) any circumstances that arise in relation to the *financial arrangement after the leaving time were disregarded.

    * (11) For the purposes of applying paragraph (5)(a) to the *head company of the group at the leaving time, disregard item 2 of the table in subsection 230305(1).

##### 230305  Table of events and allocation rules

    * (1) For the purposes of paragraph 230300(5)(a), the following table lists events and their consequences:

    * (2) For the purposes of item 2A of the table in subsection (1), determine the extent to which the gain or loss is reasonably attributable to a particular *hedged item having regard to the following:

      * (a) the fair value of the hedged item;

      * (b) the length of the period over which you have held the hedged item;

      * (c) commercially accepted valuation principles;

      * (d) any other relevant factors.

    * (3) The record must be made or in place:

      * (a) at, or soon after, the time when you create, acquire or apply the *hedging financial arrangement; or

      * (b) at such other time as is provided for in the regulations for the purposes of this paragraph.

      * (a) you must make or have in place, at, or soon before or soon after, the time when you create, acquire or apply the arrangement, a record that sets out:

        * (i) a statement of why, and the way in which, the arrangement operates commercially or economically as a hedge of the *hedged item or items; and

        * (ii) the reasons why the arrangement does not satisfy the requirements of the principles or standards referred to in paragraph 230315(2)(a) to be a hedging instrument;

      * (b) you must, at the end of each income year during which you have the arrangement, make a record of the accumulated gains and/or losses (whether realised or unrealised) as at the end of that income year from the arrangement or arrangements relating to the hedged item or items that are yet to be included in your assessable income or allowed to you as deductions;

      * (c) you must have, at the time when you create, acquire or apply the arrangement, a record that sets out your risk management policies and practices;

      * (d) you must have in place, at the time when you create, acquire or apply the arrangement, internal risk management systems and controls that record the arrangement and the hedged item or items.

    * (2) It is also a requirement of this section that the basis that you determine must:

      * (a) fairly and reasonably correspond with the basis on which gains, losses or other amounts in relation to the *hedged item or items are recognised or allocated under this Act; and

      * (b) be objective; and

      * (c) be sufficiently precise and detailed that, when your gain, loss or other amount from the *hedged item or items is taken into account for the purposes of this Act, the following will be clear from the record made under section 230355:

        * (ii) the way in which that gain or loss will be dealt with under section 230310.

          * Note: Paragraph (a) refers to an amount in relation to the hedged item or items being recognised or allocated under this Act. This would include an amount being allowed as a deduction or an amount being included in assessable income. If the hedged item were an asset, an amount referable to a part of the cost of the asset might, for example, be allowed as a deduction for a particular income year.

    * (3) To avoid doubt, the income years over which your gain or loss is to be allocated may include an income year that starts after you cease to have the *hedging financial arrangement.

##### 230365  Effectiveness of the hedge

    * The requirement of this section is that: 

      * (a) hedging the risk must be expected to be highly effective (within the meaning of the principles or standards referred to in paragraph 230315(2)(a)), for the period for which you expect to have the *hedging financial arrangement, in reducing your exposure to changes in the fair value of the *hedged item or items or cash flows attributable to your hedged risk; and

      * (c) you must assess the hedging of the risk by the arrangement:

        * (i) on a regular basis in accordance with the *accounting principles; and

        * (ii) at least once in each 12 month period; and

      * (d) your assessment must be that the hedging of the risk will be highly effective (within the meaning of the principles or standards referred to in paragraph 230315(2)(a)) in reducing your exposure to changes in the fair value of the hedged item or items or cash flows attributable to the hedged risk throughout the remainder of the period for which you expect to have the arrangement.

##### 230370  When election ceases to apply

    * (2) Subsection (1) does not prevent you from making a new *hedging financial arrangement election at a later time if you become, at that later time, eligible under subsection 230315(2) to make an election for an income year.

          * Note: The new election will only apply to financial arrangements you start to have after the start of the income year in which the new election is made.

      * (b) reacquired the arrangement at its fair value immediately after the election ceases to have effect.

    * (3) To avoid doubt, this Subdivision applies, for the purposes of working out the consequences of the disposal referred to in paragraph (2)(a), as if the *hedging financial arrangement were one to which the *hedging financial arrangement election applied at the time of the disposal.

##### 230380  Commissioner may determine that requirement met

    * Commissioner may determine that requirement met

    * (1) If (apart from this section) the requirements of sections 230355 to 230365 are not met in relation to a *hedging financial arrangement that you have, treat those requirements as having been so met if the Commissioner makes a determination under subsection (1A) in relation to the arrangement.

    * (1A) The Commissioner may make the determination if the Commissioner considers that this is appropriate, having regard to:

      * (a) the respects in which the arrangement does not meet those requirements; and

      * (b) your compliance history; and

      * (c) any changes that have been made to:

        * (i) your accounting systems and controls; and

        * (ii) your internal governance processes;

      * to ensure that breaches of the kind referred to in subsection (3) do not happen again; and

      * (d) any other relevant matter.

    * Commissioner may determine matter under section 230360

    * (6) If:

      * (a) the Commissioner makes a determination under subsection (1A) in relation to a *hedging financial arrangement; and

      * (b) either or both of the following applies:

        * (i) you fail to determine a matter in relation to the arrangement under section 230360;

        * (ii) you determine a matter in relation to the arrangement under section 230360 but the determination does not satisfy the requirements of subsection 230360(2);

    * the Commissioner may determine that matter, in a way that satisfies the requirements of section 230360. The Commissioner's determination has effect as if you had made the determination and recorded it under that section.

##### 230385  Consequences of failure to meet requirements

      * (d) any other relevant matter.

    * Commissioner may still exercise powers under section 230380

##### 230395  Election to rely on financial reports

      * (a) you prepare a financial report for that income year in accordance with:

        * (i) the *accounting principles; or

          * Note 2: For the purposes of paragraphs (c) and (e), a qualification or assessment may be relevant to the taxation treatment of financial arrangements even though it does not deal with the amount or timing of recognition of gains or losses (but relates, for example, to the reliability of the accounting systems through which information about financial arrangements is recorded).

    * (3) Paragraph (2)(e) does not apply to a report of:

      * (a) firstly, work out the gain or loss you make from the arrangement for the first year in accordance with section 230420 (treating the first year as an income year);

      * (b) next, work out how much of the gain or loss mentioned in paragraph (a) is attributable to the income year in accordance with subsection (4);

      * (c) next, work out the gain or loss you make from the arrangement for the second year in accordance with section 230420 (treating the second year as an income year);

        * (iii) if one of the amounts worked out under paragraphs (b) and (d) is a loss and the other is a gain--subtract the loss from the gain. If the result is positive, this is the gain from the arrangement for the income year. If the result is negative, this is the loss from the arrangement for the income year.

    * (4) For the purposes of paragraphs (3)(b) and (d), work out how much of the gain or loss is attributable to the income year by:

      * (a) using a methodology that is reasonable; and

      * (b) using the same methodology for the first and second years.

    * (5) For the purposes of paragraph (4)(a), treat a methodology that attributes the gain or loss on a prorata basis as _not _being reasonable.

##### 230405  Commissioner discretion to waive requirements in paragraphs 230395(2)(c) and (e)

    * (1) Paragraph 230395(2)(c) or (e) does not apply in relation to your *election to rely on financial reports for a particular income year or income years if the Commissioner determines that the paragraph does not apply to the election for that income year or those income years.

    * (2) In deciding whether to make the determination under subsection (1), the Commissioner must have regard to:

      * (a) the reasons for the noncompliance with the principles or standards concerned; and

      * (c) if you, or your activities, are subject to regulatory oversight or review--any opinions expressed by the regulator about the adequacy of remedial action of the kind referred to in paragraph (b); and

      * (d) any other relevant matter.

##### 230410  Financial arrangements to which the election applies

    * (1) An *election to rely on financial reports applies in relation to a *financial arrangement that you have if:

      * (a) the arrangement is a *Division 230 financial arrangement; and

      * (b) you start to have the arrangement in the income year in which you make the election or in a later income year; and

      * (c) the arrangement is recognised in financial reports of the kind referred to in paragraph 230395(2)(a) that are audited as referred to in paragraph 230395(2)(b); and

      * (d) if the arrangement is a financial arrangement under section 23050--the arrangement is an asset or liability that you are required (whether or not as a result of a choice you make) by:

        * (i) the *accounting principles; or

        * (ii) if the accounting principles do not apply to the preparation of the financial report--comparable standards for accounting that apply to the preparation of the financial report under a *foreign law;

      * to classify or designate, in the financial reports, as at fair value through profit or loss; and

      * (e) it is reasonably expected that the following is, or will be, the same:

        * (i) the amount of the overall gain or loss you make from the arrangement (as determined in accordance with the financial reports);

        * (ii) the amount of the overall gain or loss you make from the arrangement (as determined in accordance with the provisions of this Division if the election under this subsection did not apply to the arrangement); and

      * (f) the differences between the results of the following methods would reasonably be expected not to be substantial:

        * (i) the method used in your financial reports to work out the amounts of the gain or loss you make from the arrangement for each income year;

        * (ii) the method that would be applied by this Division to work out the amounts of those gains or losses if the election did not apply to the arrangement.

    * This subsection has effect subject to section 230415.

    * (2) In applying paragraph (1)(f) at the time when you start to have the *financial arrangement, disregard any differences between the results of the methods referred to in subparagraphs (1)(f)(i) and (ii) that are attributable solely to the provision for the possible impairment of debts required by the principles or standards referred to in paragraph 230395(2)(a).

    * (3) Subsections (4), (5) and (6) apply if, but for this subsection, paragraphs (1)(c) and (d) would not be satisfied in relation to a *financial arrangement because the arrangement is an intragroup transaction for the purposes of:

      * (a) *accounting standard AASB 127 (or another accounting standard prescribed by the regulations for the purposes of this paragraph); or

      * (b) if that standard does not apply to the preparation of the financial report--a comparable accounting standard that applies to the preparation of the financial report under a *foreign law.

          * Note: Financial arrangements between members of a consolidated group or MEC group are not covered by this subsection because the single entity rule in subsection 7011(1) operates to treat them as not being financial arrangements for the purposes of this Division.

    * (4) Paragraphs (1)(c) and (d) are taken to be satisfied in relation to the *financial arrangement.

    * (5) Paragraph (1)(e) applies as if the reference in subparagraph (1)(e)(i) to the amount of the overall gain or loss you make from the *financial arrangement (as determined in accordance with the financial reports) were a reference to the amount of that overall gain or loss (as would be determined in accordance with the financial reports if the arrangement had not been an intragroup transaction for the purposes of the standard referred to in subsection (3)).

    * (6) Paragraph (1)(f) applies as if the reference in subparagraph (1)(f)(i) to the method used in your financial reports to work out the amounts of the gain or loss you make from the arrangement for each income year were a reference to the method that would be used in your financial reports to work out those amounts if the arrangement had not been an intragroup transaction for the purposes of the standard referred to in subsection (3).

    * (7) For the purposes of applying subparagraphs (1)(e)(ii) and (f)(ii) to a *financial arrangement, assume that you had made any election that:

      * (a) you could make under Subdivision 230C or 230D; and

      * (b) could apply to the arrangement.

    * (8) If:

      * (a) the *financial arrangement would not be a financial arrangement if the following provisions were disregarded:

        * (i) Division 9A of Part III of the _Income Tax Assessment Act 1936 _(which deals with offshore banking units);

        * (ii) Part IIIB of that Act (which deals with Australian branches of foreign banks etc.); and

      * (b) paragraphs (1)(c) and (d) would be satisfied in relation to the financial arrangement if the arrangement had been between 2 separate entities; and

      * (c) the *election to rely on financial reports is made by:

        * (i) if section 121EB of the _Income Tax Assessment Act 1936 _applies--the OBU mentioned in that section (disregarding the operation of that section); or

        * (ii) if section 160ZZW of that Act applies--the bank mentioned in that section (disregarding the operation of that section);

    * paragraphs (1)(c) and (d) are taken to be satisfied in relation to the arrangement.

##### 230415  Financial arrangements not covered by election

    * (1) An *election to rely on financial reports does not apply to a *financial arrangement if:

      * (a) the arrangement is an *equity interest; and

      * (b) you are the issuer of the equity interest.

    * (2) An *election to rely on financial reports does not apply to a *financial arrangement if:

      * (a) you are:

        * (i) an individual; or

        * (ii) an entity (other than an individual) that satisfies subsection 230455(2), (3) or (4) for the income year in which you start to have the arrangement; and

      * (b) the arrangement is a *qualifying security; and

      * (c) you have not made an election under subsection 230455(7).

    * (3) An *election to rely on financial reports does not apply to a *financial arrangement if:

      * (a) the election is made by the *head company of a *consolidated group or *MEC group; and

      * (b) the election specifies that the election is not to apply to financial arrangements in relation to *life insurance business carried on by a member of the consolidated group or MEC group; and

      * (c) the arrangement is one that relates to the life insurance business carried on by a member of the consolidated group or MEC group.

    * (4) An *election to rely on financial reports does not apply to a *financial arrangement if the arrangement is associated with a business of a kind specified in regulations made for the purposes of this subsection.

##### 230420  Effect of election to rely on financial reports

    * (1) If an *election to rely on financial reports applies to a *financial arrangement, the gain or loss you make from the arrangement for an income year is:

      * (a) the gain or loss that the principles or standards referred to in paragraph 230395(2)(a) require you to recognise in profit or loss from that arrangement for that income year; or

      * (b) if subsection 230410(3) applies to the arrangement--the gain or loss that the principles or standards referred to in paragraph 230395(2)(a) would have required you to recognise in profit or loss from that arrangement for that income year if the arrangement had not been an intragroup transaction for the purposes of the standard referred to in paragraph 230410(3)(b); or

      * (c) if subsection 230410(8) applies to the arrangement--the gain or loss that the principles or standards referred to in paragraph 230410(1)(d) would have required you to recognise in profit or loss for the year from the asset or liability mentioned in paragraph 230410(1)(d) if the arrangement had been between 2 separate entities.

          * Note: Subsection 23040(7) provides that this Subdivision does not apply to a gain or loss from a financial arrangement to the extent to which Subdivision 230E (hedging financial arrangements method) applies to the arrangement.

    * (2) Subsection (3) applies if:

      * (a) a *head company of a *consolidated group or *MEC group has a *financial arrangement; and

      * (c) a subsidiary member of the group ceases to be a member of the group at a particular time (the **_leaving time_**); and

      * (d) immediately after the leaving time, the subsidiary member has the arrangement.

    * (3) The gain or loss the group makes from the *financial arrangement for the income year in which the leaving time occurs is taken to be the gain or loss that the principles or standards referred to in paragraph 230395(2)(a) would require the group to recognise in profit or loss from the arrangement for that income year if:

      * (a) the circumstances that existed in relation to the arrangement (including its value) immediately before the leaving time had continued to exist until the end of the income year; and

      * (b) any circumstances that arise in relation to the arrangement after the leaving time were disregarded.

##### 230425  When election ceases to apply

    * (1) An election under subsection 230395(1) ceases to have effect from the start of an income year if you cease to be eligible to make an *election to rely on financial reports for that income year.

    * (2) Subsection (1) does not prevent you from making a new election under subsection 230395(1) at a later time if you become, at that later time, eligible to make an *election to rely on financial reports for an income year.

          * Note: The new election will only apply to financial arrangements you start to have after the start of the income year in which the new election is made.

    * (3) An election under subsection 230395(1) ceases to apply to a *financial arrangement from the start of an income year if the arrangement ceases to satisfy a requirement of paragraph 230410(1)(c), (d), (e) or (f) during that income year.

    * (4) If the election ceases to apply to a particular *financial arrangement under subsection (3), the election cannot subsequently apply to that arrangement (even if the requirements of paragraphs 230410(1)(c), (d), (e) and (f) are satisfied once more in relation to the arrangement).

##### 230430  Balancing adjustment if election ceases to apply

    * (1) You must make balancing adjustments under subsection (2) if an election under subsection 230395(1) ceases to have effect under subsection 230425(1).

    * (2) The balancing adjustments under this subsection are the balancing adjustments you would make under Subdivision 230G in relation to each of the *financial arrangements to which the election applied if you disposed of the arrangement for its fair value when the election ceases to have effect.

    * (3) You must make balancing adjustments under subsection (5) if an election under subsection 230395(1) ceases to apply to a particular *financial arrangement under subsection 230425(3).

    * (4) Subsection (3) does not apply to a *financial arrangement if:

      * (a) the arrangement is not one that you are required (whether or not as a result of a choice you make) by the principles or standards referred to in paragraph 230395(2)(a) to classify or designate, in your financial reports, as at fair value through profit or loss; and

      * (b) the election under subsection 230395(1) ceases to apply to the arrangement because the arrangement fails to satisfy the requirements of paragraph 230410(1)(e) or (f); and

      * (c) the arrangement ceases to satisfy the requirements of that paragraph because the arrangement becomes impaired for the purposes of those principles or standards.

    * (5) The balancing adjustment under this subsection is the balancing adjustment you would make under Subdivision 230G if you disposed of the *financial arrangement for its fair value when the election ceases to apply to the arrangement.

    * (6) If a balancing adjustment is made under subsection (2) or (5) in relation to a *financial arrangement, you are taken, for the purposes of this Division, to have reacquired the arrangement at its fair value immediately after the election ceased to have effect or ceased to apply to the arrangement.

             * Note: This would include financial benefits you provide in relation to the transfer or cessation (see paragraph 23060(1)(c)).

          * (b) the total of the amounts that have been included in your assessable income, because of circumstances that have occurred before the transfer or cessation, as gains from the arrangement;

          * (c) the total of the other amounts that would have been included in your assessable income, because of circumstances that have occurred before the transfer or cessation, as gains from the arrangement if all your gains from the arrangement were assessable;

             * Note: The gains from the arrangement here include amounts of exempt income or nonassessable nonexempt income.

          * (d) the total of the amounts that will be included in your assessable income after the transfer or cessation because of a balancing adjustment under subitems 104(12) to (18) of the _Tax Laws Amendment (Taxation of Financial Arrangements) Act 2009 _to the extent to which those amounts are attributable to the arrangement.

          * (e) the total of the amounts that will be included in your assessable income after the transfer or cessation because of sections 230160 and 230165 to the extent to which those amounts are attributable to the arrangement.

        * Step 3.	Compare the amount obtained under step 1 (the **_step 1 amount_**) with the amount obtained under step 2 (the **_step 2 amount_**). If the step 1 amount exceeds the step 2 amount, an amount equal to the excess is taken, as a balancing adjustment, to be a gain you make from the *financial arrangement for the purposes of this Division. If the step 2 amount exceeds the step 1 amount, an amount equal to the excess is taken, as a balancing adjustment, to be a loss that you make from the arrangement. If the step 1 amount and the step 2 amount are equal, no balancing adjustment is made.

    * Proportionate transfer of all rights and/or obligations under financial arrangement

    * (2) If subparagraph 230435(1)(c)(i) applies, you make the balancing adjustment by applying the method statement in subsection (1) but reduce:

      * (a) the amounts referred to in step 1; and

      * (b) the amounts referred to in step 2;

    * by applying the proportion referred to in subparagraph 230435(1)(c)(i) to them.

    * Transfer of specifically identified right or obligation under financial arrangement

    * (3) If subparagraph 230435(1)(c)(ii) applies, you make the balancing adjustment by applying the method statement in subsection (1) as if the references to:

      * (a) the amounts referred to in step 1; and

      * (b) the amounts referred to in step 2;

    * were references to those amounts to the extent to which they are reasonably attributable to the right or obligation referred to in subparagraph 230435(1)(c)(ii).

    * Proportionate transfer of specifically identified right or obligation under financial arrangement

    * (4) If subparagraph 230435(1)(c)(iii) applies, you make the balancing adjustment by applying the method statement:

      * (a) as if the references to:

        * (i) the amounts referred to in step 1; and

        * (ii) the amounts referred to in step 2;

      * were references to those amounts to the extent to which they are reasonably attributable to the right or obligation referred to in subparagraph 230435(1)(c)(iii); and

      * (b) by reducing those amounts by applying the proportion referred to in subparagraph 230435(1)(c)(iii) to them.

    * Attribution must reflect appropriate and commercially accepted valuation principles

    * (5) Any attribution made under subsection (3) or paragraph (4)(a) must reflect appropriate and commercially accepted valuation principles that properly take into account:

      * (a) the nature of the rights and obligations under the *financial arrangement; and

      * (b) the risks associated with each *financial benefit, right and obligation under the arrangement; and

      * (c) the time value of money.

    * Income year for which gain or loss is made

    * (6) The gain or loss you are taken to make under subsection (1), (2), (3) or (4) is a gain or loss for the income year in which the event referred to in subsection 230435(1) occurs.

    * Treatment of bad debts in relation to financial arrangements

    * (7) For the purposes of applying paragraph (b) of step 1 of the method statement in subsection (1) to a *financial arrangement, a bad debt deduction in relation to the arrangement to which subsection 23025(3) applies is taken to be a deduction for a loss from the arrangement.

    * (1) The object of this section is to deal with your gains and losses for an income year in which you change residence by:

      * (a) allocating the gains and losses to your periods of Australian and foreign residence in that income year; and

      * (b) determining the assessability of the gains and the deductibility of the losses according to:

        * (i) your residency in each period; and

        * (ii) the sources of the gains and the connection of the losses with your assessable income.

    * (2) This section applies if:

      * (a) assuming that you disregarded this section and subsection 23040(2), you would apply the fair value or foreign exchange retranslation method or the method of relying on your financial reports to determine the amount of:

        * (i) a gain included in your assessable income under section 23015 for the income year; or

        * (ii) a loss you can deduct under section 23015 for the income year; and

      * (b) subsection (4) does not apply in relation to any gain or loss under the arrangement.

    * (8) Apply that method to work out:

      * (a) a gain or loss from the arrangement for the foreign residency period; and

      * (b) a gain or loss from the arrangement for the Australian residency period.

##### 230490  Effect of change of residence--disposal and reacquisition etc. after ceasing to be Australian resident where no further recognised gains or losses from arrangement

    * (1) This section applies if:

      * (a) you cease to be an Australian resident at a particular time (the **_residence change time_**); and

      * (b) you have a *financial arrangement at the residence change time; and

      * (c) at the residence change time you expect that any gains and losses you make from the arrangement after that time will not be assessable or deductible under this Division.

    * (2) You are taken for the purposes of this Division:

      * (a) to have disposed of the arrangement just before that time for its fair value just before that time; and

      * (b) to have acquired the arrangement again at the residence change time for its fair value at that time.

##### 230495  Effect of change of accounting principles or standards

    * (1) This section applies if:

      * (a) one of these methods apply to take account of a gain or loss you make from a *financial arrangement:

        * (i) the fair value method provided for in Subdivision 230C; or

        * (ii) the foreign exchange retranslation method provided for in Subdivision 230D; or

        * (iii) the method of relying on your financial reports provided for in Subdivision 230F; and

      * (b) there is a change in, or in the application of, the relevant principles or standards (as mentioned in section 230230 (fair value method), 230280 (foreign exchange retranslation method) or 230420 (method of relying on financial reports)) that apply in relation to the arrangement; and

      * (c) that change applies to a particular income year and later years; and

      * (d) as a result of the change, those principles or standards require you to recognise in your statement of financial position an amount (the **_equity amount_**), in order to avoid the need to increase or decrease gains or losses recognised in profit or loss from the financial arrangement in respect of previous income years.

    * (2) If the equity amount is positive, include in your assessable income for the particular income year mentioned in paragraph (1)(c) so much of it as relates to the *financial arrangement mentioned in paragraph (1)(a).

    * (3) If the equity amount is negative, you are entitled to a deduction for the particular income year mentioned in paragraph (1)(c) equal to so much of it as relates to the *financial arrangement mentioned in paragraph (1)(a).

##### 230500  Comparable foreign accounting and auditing standards

    * The regulations may: 

      * (a) specify that particular standards that apply under a *foreign law are to be taken for the purposes of this Division to be comparable to the *accounting principles; and

      * (b) specify that particular standards that apply under a foreign law are to be taken for the purposes of this Division to be comparable to the *auditing principles.

##### 230505  Financial arrangement as consideration for provision or acquisition of a thing

    * (1) This section applies if you start or cease to have a *Division 230 financial arrangement as consideration for the provision or acquisition of a thing.

    * (2) Work out the *market value of the thing at the time at which you (in fact) provide or acquire it. For the purposes of applying this Act to you, treat the amount:

      * (a) you obtain for providing the thing; or

      * (b) you provide for acquiring the thing;

    * as being that market value.

          * Note 1: The amount may be relevant, for example, for the purposes of applying the provisions of this Act dealing with capital gains, capital allowances or trading stock to the thing.

          * Note 2: This subsection does not affect the financial benefits received or provided under the financial arrangement from you starting or ceasing to have it (except in the circumstances described in Note 3). However:

           * (a) the market value of the thing will be, or form part of, those financial benefits for the purposes of section 230445; and

           * (b) in the case of a non arm's length transaction, the amount of those financial benefits may be affected by section 230510.

          * Note 3: If the thing is itself a Division 230 financial arrangement and subsection (3) does not apply, this subsection will determine the financial benefits received or provided under the financial arrangement from you starting or ceasing to have it.

    * (3) Subsection (2) does not apply if:

      * (a) you start or cease to have the *financial arrangement as mentioned in subsection (1) under an arrangement (the **_starting or ceasing arrangement_**); and

      * (b) the thing is itself a *Division 230 financial arrangement; and

      * (c) the starting or ceasing arrangement is _not _itself a Division 230 financial arrangement.

          * Example: An arrangement for exchanging a share subject to Subdivision 230C for another share subject to Subdivision 230C, where the arrangement itself is not a Division 230 financial arrangement.

    * (4) For the purposes of this section:

      * (a) treat yourself as providing a thing to another entity if:

        * (i) you have provided, or are to provide, the thing to the other entity; or

        * (ii) you cease to have, have ceased to have or are to cease to have, the thing; or

        * (iii) the other entity starts to have, has started having or is to start to have, the thing; and

      * (b) treat yourself as acquiring a thing if:

        * (i) another entity has provided, or is to provide, the thing to you; or

        * (ii) another entity ceases to have, has ceased to have or is to cease to have, the thing; or

        * (iii) you start to have, have started to have or are to start to have, the thing.

    * (5) For the purposes of this section, treat part of a *Division 230 financial arrangement as a Division 230 financial arrangement.

    * (6) Without limiting subsection (1), the thing provided, or the thing acquired, need not be a tangible thing and may take the form of services, conferring a right, incurring an obligation or extinguishing or varying a right or obligation.

    * (7) To avoid doubt, this section applies even if your starting or ceasing to have the *financial arrangement mentioned in subsection (1) is only part of the consideration for the provision or acquisition of the thing.

    * (8) For the purposes of this section, treat your starting or ceasing to have the *financial arrangement mentioned in subsection (1) as consideration for the provision or acquisition of the thing if that starting or ceasing is, in substance or effect, done for the provision or acquisition of the thing.

          * Example: Starting to have a financial arrangement in satisfaction of an obligation, where the obligation itself was incurred as consideration for the thing.

##### 230510  Nonarm's length dealings in relation to financial arrangement

    * (1) This section applies if:

      * (a) a balancing adjustment is made under Subdivision 230G in relation to a *Division 230 financial arrangement you have; and

      * (b) if the balancing adjustment was made because of paragraph 230435(1)(b) or (d) (cessations without transfer)--the arrangement is not a *debt interest or loan.

    * Nonarm's length transaction resulting in change of an amount of a financial benefit that you provided or received under the financial arrangement

    * (2) The provisions are as follows:

    * (4) However, if the circumstances that give rise to the adjustment result in section 230510 having the effect of altering the amount of the gain or loss, do not treat the relevant amount as having been adjusted under subsection (3) to the extent of that alteration.

##### 230520  Disregard gains or losses covered by value shifting regime

    * (1) Disregard a gain or loss under this Division from a *financial arrangement to the extent that it is attributable to:

      * (a) a shifting of value that has consequences under Division 723; or

      * (b) a *direct value shift that has consequences under Division 725; or

      * (c) an *indirect value shift that has consequences under Division 727; or

##### Guide to Division 240

##### 2401  What this Division is about

    * For income tax purposes, some arrangements (such as hire purchase agreements) are recharacterised as a sale of property, combined with a loan, by the notional seller to the notional buyer, to finance the purchase price.

##### 2403  How the recharacterisation affects the notional seller

    * Effect of notional sale

    * (1) The consideration for the notional sale is either the price stated as the cost or value of the property or its arm's length value. If the notional seller is disposing of the property as trading stock, the normal consequences of disposing of trading stock follow. In particular, the notional seller will be assessed on the sale price.

    * (2) Where the property is not trading stock the notional seller's assessable income will include any profit made by the notional seller on the notional sale or on the sale of the property after a notional reacquisition.

    * Effect of notional loan

    * (3) The notional seller's assessable income will include notional interest over the period of the loan.

    * Other effects

    * (4) These effects displace the income tax consequences that would otherwise arise from the arrangement. For example, the actual payments to the notional seller are not included in its assessable income. Also, the notional seller loses the right to deduct amounts under Division 40 (about capital allowances).

##### 2407  How the recharacterisation affects the notional buyer

    * Effect of notional purchase

    * (1) The cost of the acquisition is either the price stated as the cost or value of the property or its arm's length value. If the notional buyer is acquiring the property as trading stock, the normal consequences of acquiring trading stock follow. In particular, the notional buyer can usually deduct the purchase price.

    * (2) If the property is not trading stock, the notional buyer may be able to deduct amounts for the expenditure under Division 40 (about capital allowances).

    * Effect of notional loan

    * (3) The notional buyer may be able to deduct notional interest payments over the period of the loan.

    * Other effects

    * (4) These effects displace the income tax consequences that would otherwise arise from the arrangement. For example, the notional buyer cannot deduct the actual payments to the notional seller.

##### Operative provisions

##### 24017  Who is the notional seller and the notional buyer?

    * (1) An entity is the **_notional seller_** if it is a party to the *arrangement and:

      * (a) actually owns the property; or

      * (b) is the owner of the property because of a previous operation of this Division.

    * (2) An entity is the **_notional buyer_** if it is a party to the *arrangement and, under the arrangement, has the *right to use the property.

          * Example: If the arrangement is a hire purchase agreement, the finance provider will be the notional seller and the hirer will be the notional buyer.

##### 24020  Notional sale of property by notional seller and notional acquisition of property by notional buyer

    * (1) The *notional seller is taken to have disposed of the property by way of sale to the *notional buyer, and the notional buyer is taken to have acquired it, at the start of the *arrangement.

    * (2) The *notional buyer is taken to own the property until:

      * (a) the *arrangement ends; or

      * (b) the notional buyer becomes the *notional seller under a later arrangement to which this Division applies.

##### 24025  Notional loan by notional seller to notional buyer

    * (1) On entering into the *arrangement, the *notional seller is taken to have made a loan (the **_notional loan_**) to the *notional buyer.

    * (2) The notional loan is for a period:

      * (a) starting at the start of the *arrangement; and

      * (b) ending on the day on which the arrangement is to cease to have effect or, if the arrangement is of indefinite duration, on the day on which it would be reasonable to conclude, having regard to the terms and conditions of the arrangement, that the arrangement will cease to have effect.

    * (3) The notional loan is of an amount (the **_notional loan principal_**) equal to the consideration for the sale of the property less any amount paid, or credited by the *notional seller as having been paid, by the *notional buyer to the notional seller, at or before the start of the *arrangement, for the cost of the property.

          * Note: Section 24080 affects the amount of the notional loan principal where the arrangement is an extension or renewal of another arrangement.

    * (4) The notional loan is subject to payment of interest.

    * (5) The consideration for the sale of the property by the *notional seller, and the cost of the acquisition of the property by the *notional buyer, are each taken to have been:

      * (a) if an amount is stated to be the cost or value of the property for the purposes of the *arrangement and the notional seller and the notional buyer were dealing with each other at *arm's length in connection with the arrangement--the amount so stated; or

      * (b) otherwise--the amount that could reasonably have been expected to have been paid by the notional buyer for the purchase of the property if:

        * (i) the notional seller had actually sold the property to the notional buyer at the start of the arrangement; and 

        * (ii) the notional seller and the notional buyer were dealing with each other at arm's length in connection with the sale.

    * (6) The notional loan principal is taken to be repaid, and the interest is taken to be paid, by the making of the payments under the *arrangement.

    * Profit on notional sale

    * (2) If the property is not *trading stock of the *notional seller and the consideration for the notional sale of the property exceeds the cost of the acquisition of the property by the notional seller, the excess is included in the notional seller's assessable income of the income year of the notional sale.

    * Profit on actual sale after notional reacquisition

    * (3) If:

##### Operative provisions

##### 24060  Notional interest

    * (1) The ***_notional interest_** for an *arrangement payment period is worked out as follows:

Calculating *notional interest

        * Step 1.	Add the *notional interest from previous *arrangement payment periods to the notional loan principal.

        * Step 2.	Subtract any *arrangement payments that have already been made or that are due but that have not been made. The result is the **_outstanding notional loan principal _**as at the start of the *arrangement payment period.

        * Step 3.	Work out the **_implicit interest rate_** for the *arrangement payment period, taking into account the *arrangement payments payable by the *notional buyer under the *arrangement and any *termination amounts.

        * Step 4.	Multiply the outstanding notional loan principal by the implicit interest rate. The result is the **_notional interest_** for the *arrangement payment period.

    * (2) If only part of an *arrangement payment period occurs during an income year, the *notional interest for that part of the arrangement payment period is so much of the notional interest for that arrangement payment period as may appropriately be related to that income year in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles.

    * (3) In calculating the implicit interest rate, if any of the relevant amounts are not known at the start of the *arrangement, a reasonable estimate of the amount is to be made and is to be used for the purposes of calculating the implicit interest rate for each income year of the *notional seller.

    * (4) If a reasonable estimate cannot be made at that time, an estimate of the amount is to be made at the end of each income year of the *notional seller for the purposes of calculating the implicit interest rate for each income year of the notional seller.

##### 24065  Arrangement payments

    * An **_arrangement payment_** is an amount that the *notional buyer is required to pay under the *arrangement but does not include:

      * (a) an amount in the nature of a penalty payable for failure to make a payment on time; or

      * (b) a *termination amount.

##### 24070  Arrangement payment periods

    * (1) An ***_arrangement payment period_** is a period for which a payment under the *arrangement is allocated or expressed to be payable.

    * (2) However, if a period exceeds 6 months, the period is not an *arrangement payment period but each of the following parts of the period is a separate arrangement payment period:

      * (a) the part of the period beginning at the start of that period and ending 6 months later;

      * (b) each part of the period:

        * (i) beginning immediately after a part of the period that is an arrangement payment period under paragraph (a) or under a previous application of this paragraph; and

        * (ii) ending 6 months after the start of that later part or at the end of the period, whichever first occurs.

##### Subdivision 240F--The end of the arrangement

##### Table of sections

  * Operative provisions

       * 24075	When is the end of the arrangement?

       * 24080	What happens if the arrangement is extended or renewed

       * 24085	What happens if an amount is paid by or on behalf of the notional buyer to acquire the property

       * 24090	What happens if the notional buyer ceases to have the right to use the property

##### Operative provisions

##### 24075  When is the end of the arrangement?

    * (1) If the *arrangement is stated to cease to have effect at a particular time, it is taken for the purposes of this Division to end (even if it is extended or renewed) at the earlier of:

      * (a) that time; or

      * (b) the time at which the arrangement ceases to have effect (whether because the arrangement is terminated or for any other reason).

          * Note: Section 24080 deals with extensions and renewals.

    * (2) An *arrangement is taken to have ended if it is extended or renewed.

    * (3) If the *arrangement is of indefinite duration, it ends at the time at which the arrangement ceases to have effect even if the *arrangement is renewed.

          * Note: Section 24080 deals with extensions and renewals.

    * (4) An *arrangement is taken to have ended if it is reasonable to conclude, having regard to the terms and conditions of the *arrangement, that the arrangement has ceased to have effect.

    * (5) An *arrangement is also taken to have ended if the property has been lost or destroyed.

##### 24080  What happens if the arrangement is extended or renewed

    * (1) This section sets out what happens if, after the end of the *arrangement, the *notional buyer and *notional seller extend or renew the *arrangement.

    * (2) This Division applies as if the original *arrangement has ended and the extended arrangement or renewed arrangement is a separate arrangement (the **_new arrangement_**).

    * (3) There is not, however, taken to be any disposal or acquisition as a result of the original arrangement ending or of the new arrangement starting and the *notional buyer does not cease to own the property.

    * (4) Also, the notional loan principal for the new loan is:

      * (a) if the *arrangement as extended or renewed states an amount as the cost or value of the property for the purposes of the extension or renewal and the *notional seller and the *notional buyer were dealing with each other at *arm's length in connection with the extension or renewal--the amount so stated; or

      * (b) otherwise--the amount that could reasonably have been expected to have been paid by the notional buyer for the purchase of the property if:

        * (i) the notional seller had actually sold the property to the notional buyer when the arrangement was extended or renewed; and

        * (ii) the notional seller and notional buyer were dealing with each other at arm's length in connection with the sale.

    * (5) Subdivision 240G applies to the notional loan for the original arrangement. For that purpose, the notional loan principal for the new arrangement is taken to be a *termination amount paid to the *notional seller under the original arrangement.

##### 24085  What happens if an amount is paid by or on behalf of the notional buyer to acquire the property

    * If, at or after the end of the *arrangement, an amount is paid to the *notional seller by, or on behalf of, the *notional buyer to acquire the property, the following provisions have effect:

      * (a) the amount paid is not included in the notional seller's assessable income;

      * (b) the notional buyer cannot deduct the payment;

      * (c) the notional buyer is taken to continue to own the property;

      * (d) the transfer to the notional buyer of legal title to the property is not taken to be a disposal of the property by the notional seller.

##### 24090  What happens if the notional buyer ceases to have the right to use the property

    * (1) This section applies if, at the end of the *arrangement:

      * (a) the arrangement is not extended or renewed in the way mentioned in subsection 24080(1); and

      * (b) no amount is paid to the *notional seller by, or on behalf of, the *notional buyer to acquire the property; and

      * (c) the property is not lost or destroyed.

    * (2) The property is taken to have been disposed of by the *notional buyer by way of sale back to the *notional seller, and to have been acquired by the *notional seller, at the end of the *arrangement.

    * (3) The consideration for the sale of the property by the *notional buyer, and the cost of the acquisition of the property by the *notional seller, are each taken to be equal to the *market value of the property at the end of the *arrangement.

    * (4) Subsection (5) applies where the property is a *car and if it:

      * (a) had been bought from the *notional seller, when this Division first applied to an *arrangement in respect of the car, by the *notional buyer for a price equal to the notional loan principal; and

      * (b) had been first used by the notional buyer for any purpose in the *financial year in which that time occurred;

    * the cost of the car, for the purpose of working out its decline in value for that person under Division 40, would have been limited by section 40230.

    * (5) Where an associate of the *notional buyer acquires the *car, the *cost of the car for the purposes of the application of Division 40 to the associate is taken to be whichever is the lesser of:

      * (a) the sum of:

        * (i) the amount that would have been the *adjustable value of the car at that time for the purposes of the application of that Division to the notional buyer if the notional buyer were not taken under this Division to have disposed of the car; and

        * (ii) any amount that is included in the notional buyer's assessable income under section 40285 because the notional buyer is taken to have disposed of the car; or

      * (b) the cost of the acquisition of the car by the associate.

##### Subdivision 240G--Adjustments if total amount assessed to notional seller differs from amount of interest

##### Guide to Subdivision 240G

##### 240100  What this Subdivision is about

    * This Subdivision provides for adjustments if the sum of the amounts included in the notional seller's assessable income are greater or less than the interest, worked out at the end of the arrangement, for the notional loan.

##### Table of sections

  * Operative provisions

       * 240110	Adjustments for notional buyer

##### Operative provisions

##### 240105  Adjustments for notional seller

    * (1) This section applies at the end of the *arrangement.

    * (2) If the sum of:

      * (a) all amounts (other than *termination amounts) that were paid or payable to the *notional seller under the *arrangement; and

      * (b) any termination amounts paid or payable to the notional seller;

    * exceeds the amount worked out using the formula in subsection (4), the excess is included in the notional seller's assessable income of the income year in which the arrangement ends.

          * Note: Subsection 24080(5) provides that the amount of a notional loan that is taken to be made by an extended or renewed arrangement is a termination amount paid under the previous arrangement.

    * (3) If the amount worked out using the formula in subsection (4) exceeds:

      * (a) all amounts (other than *termination amounts) that were paid or payable to the *notional seller under the *arrangement; and

      * (b) any termination amounts paid or payable to the notional seller;

    * the notional seller is entitled to deduct the excess in the income year in which the arrangement ends.

          * Note: Subsection 24080(5) provides that the amount of a notional loan that is taken to be made by an extended or renewed arrangement is a termination amount paid under the previous arrangement.

    * (4) The formula for the purposes of subsections (2) and (3) is:

    * where: 

    * **_assessed notional interest_** means the *notional interest that has been or is to be included in the *notional seller's assessable income of any income year.

##### 240110  Adjustments for notional buyer

    * (1) If:

      * (a) an amount is included in the *notional seller's assessable income of an income year under subsection 240105(2); or

      * (b) an amount would have been so included if the notional seller had been subject to tax on assessable income;

    * the *notional buyer is entitled to deduct a corresponding amount in the notional buyer's income year.

    * (2) If:

      * (a) the *notional seller is entitled to deduct an amount for an income year under subsection 240105(3); or

      * (b) the notional seller would have been so entitled if the *notional seller had been subject to tax on assessable income;

    * a corresponding amount is included in the notional buyer's assessable income for the notional buyer's income year.

    * (3) The *notional buyer is entitled to a deduction, and is required to include an amount in his or her assessable income only to the extent (if any) that the notional buyer would, apart from this Division, have been entitled to deduct *arrangement payments if no part of those payments were capital in nature.

##### Subdivision 240H--Application of Division 16E to certain arrangements

##### 240112  Division 16E applies to certain arrangements

    * (1) Division 16E of Part III of the _Income Tax Assessment Act 1936_ applies in relation to an arrangement (the **_assignment arrangement_**) between the notional seller and another person (the **_holder_**) to transfer the right to payments (the **_Division 240 payments_**) under an arrangement that is treated as a sale and loan by this Division (the **_sale and loan arrangement_**).

    * (2) In applying Division 16E, the following assumptions are to be made:

      * (a) the assignment arrangement is the qualifying security;

      * (b) the notional seller is the issuer;

      * (c) the qualifying security is issued when the assignment arrangement is entered into;

      * (d) the issue price is consideration provided to the notional seller under the assignment arrangement;

      * (e) the Division 240 payments are payments made by the notional seller under the assignment arrangement;

      * (f) no part of the payments represent periodic interest.

    * (3) This Subdivision does not apply if the assignment arrangement gives rise to a termination of the sale and loan arrangement for the purposes of this Division.

    * (4) To avoid doubt, Division 6A of Part III of the _Income Tax Assessment Act 1936_ does not apply to an assignment arrangement to which this Subdivision applies.

##### Subdivision 240I--Provisions applying to hire purchase agreements

  * Operative provisions

       * 240115	Another person, or no person taken to own property in certain cases

##### Operative provisions

##### 240115  Another person, or no person taken to own property in certain cases

    * (1) This section sets out special modifications of the effect of this Division that apply in relation to a *hire purchase agreement unless:

      * (a) the notional buyer would have been the owner or the *quasiowner of the property if the *arrangement had been a sale of the property; and

      * (b) it is reasonably likely that the right, obligation or contingent obligation to acquire the property will be exercised by, or in respect of, the notional buyer.

           * Note: An example of a contingent obligation is a put option.

    * (2) The modifications also apply if the *notional buyer:

      * (a) disposes of his or her interest in the property; or

      * (b) enters into a lease covered by Division 242 (about luxury car leases) under which he or she leases the property to another person.

    * Modifications

    * (3) For the purpose of the *capital allowance provisions, if, apart from the operation of this Division, an entity other than the *notional seller would own the property that is the subject of an agreement covered by this section, that entity is taken to be the owner of the property.

    * (4) For the purpose of the *capital allowance provisions, if, apart from the operation of this Division, the *notional seller would own the property that is the subject of an agreement covered by this section, no entity is taken to be the owner of the property.

##### Guide to Division 242

##### 2421  What this Division is about

    * A luxury car is one whose market value exceeds the car limit set for a car's capital allowance deductions by section 40230.

    * If the lessor of a luxury car is tax exempt, or taxed at a lower rate than the lessee, the lease could be structured to give both parties a better aftertax outcome than if the lessee had bought the car. The lessee could fully deduct the lease payments, thereby avoiding the capital allowance limit for luxury cars, and the lessor would receive higher lease payments.

    * This Division removes the tax benefit for the lessee by putting both parties in the same position as if the lessor had sold the car to the lessee and lent the lessee the purchase price.

##### Subdivision 242A--Notional sale and loan

##### Guide to Subdivision 242A

##### 2425  What this Subdivision is about

    * A leased luxury car is treated for income tax purposes as if it had been sold by the lessor to the lessee for the car's market value. The lessor is treated as having lent the lessee the money to buy the car, and the lease payments are treated as payments of the principal and interest on that notional loan.

       * 24225	Notional loan by lessor to lessee

##### Operative provisions

##### 24210  Application

    * (1) This Division applies to a *car that:

      * (a) is leased (but not under a *shortterm hire agreement or a *hire purchase agreement) for consideration; and

      * (b) was a *luxury car when the lessor first leased it; and

      * (c) is not *trading stock of the lessee; and

      * (d) is not a car covered by subsection 40230(2) (about cars modified to carry individuals with a disability).

    * (2) The provisions of this Division do not have effect for the purposes of Division 11A of Part III of the _Income Tax Assessment Act 1936 _(about withholding tax on dividends, interest and royalties).

          * Note: This subsection prevents interest on the notional loan that this Division creates being subject to withholding tax under Division 11A.

    * (3) For the purposes of paragraph (1)(a), the question whether an agreement is a *shortterm hire agreement is determined on the basis that an employee or employer of an entity is an *associate of the entity.

          * Note: Under the definition of **_shortterm hire agreement_** in subsection 9951(1), successive agreements for the hire of the same asset to an entity or its associates are not shortterm hire agreements if they result in substantial continuity of hiring.

##### 24215  Notional sale and acquisition

    * (1) This Act has effect as if:

      * (a) the *car had been disposed of (the **_notional sale_**) by the lessor to the lessee; and

      * (b) the car had been acquired by the lessee;

    * at the start of the term of the lease.

          * Note: This Act will apply as it would have if the lessor had actually disposed of the car to the lessee. For example, if the lessor had been deducting an amount for the car's decline in value, the notional disposal will activate the balancing adjustment rules in Subdivision 40D because the lessor would be treated as no longer holding the car.

    * (2) This Act also has effect as if the lessee owns the *car until:

      * (a) the lease (not including any extension or renewal of the lease) ends; or

      * (b) the lessee enters into a sublease of the car and this Division applies to the car in relation to the sublease.

          * Note 1: This means that the lessee (and not the lessor) may be able to deduct amounts for the decline in value of the car under Division 40.

          * Note 2: The lessee will be treated as continuing to own the car until the end of any extension or renewal: see section 24280.

##### 24220  Consideration for notional sale, and cost, of car

    * (1) The consideration for the notional sale by the lessor, and the first element of the *cost of the *car for the lessee, are the car's *market value at the start of the term of the lease.

    * (2) If:

      * (a) the lease is a sublease; and

      * (b) the lessee is one or more of the following:

        * (i) an *associate of the lessor;

        * (ii) an employer of the lessor;

        * (iii) an employee of the lessor;

    * the first element of the *cost of the *car to the lessee is the sum of:

      * (c) the amount that would have been the car's *adjustable value at the start of the term of the lease for the purposes of applying this Act to the lessor if the lessor were not taken under this Division to have disposed of the car; and

      * (d) any amount that is included in the lessor's assessable income under section 40285 as a balancing adjustment because the lessor is treated as having disposed of the car.

          * Note: Section 24220 of the _Income Tax (Transitional Provisions) Act 1997_ extends paragraph (2)(d) to cover amounts included in assessable income under former provisions corresponding to section 40285.

##### 24225  Notional loan by lessor to lessee

    * (1) This Act has effect as if, on the grant of the lease, the lessor had made a loan (the **_notional loan_**) to the lessee:

      * (a) for a period equal to the term of the lease (not including the term of any extension or renewal); and

      * (b) of an amount (the **_notional loan principal_**) equal to the consideration for the notional sale of the *car less any amount paid, or credited by the lessor as having been paid, by the lessee to the lessor, at or before the start of the term of the lease, for the first element of the *cost of the car to the lessee; and

      * (c) subject to payment of interest.

          * Note: There is a further notional loan if the lease is extended or renewed: see section 24280.

    * (2) This Act has effect as if the notional loan principal were repaid, and the interest were paid, by the making of the *luxury car lease payments.

##### Subdivision 242B--Amount to be included in lessor's assessable income

##### Guide to Subdivision 242B

##### 24230  What this Subdivision is about

    * The lessor's assessable income includes the interest on the notional loan.

    * The lease payments to the lessor are nonassessable nonexempt income.

             * Note: If the consideration for a notional sale of a car exceeds the adjustable value of the car to the lessor, the excess will be included in the lessor's assessable income under section 40285.

             * There would be a similar result if the lessor is treated as having reacquired the car and then sells the car for more than the cost of reacquisition.

##### Table of sections

  * Operative provisions

       * 24235	Amount to be included in lessor's assessable income

       * 24240	Treatment of lease payments

##### Operative provisions

##### 24235  Amount to be included in lessor's assessable income

    * Accrual amounts

    * (1) The lessor's assessable income for an income year includes:

      * (a) if a *luxury car lease payment period for the lease of a *car occurs wholly during that income year--the amount (an **_accrual amount_**) worked out under subsection (2) for that luxury car lease payment period; and

      * (b) if part of a luxury car lease payment period for the lease of a car occurs during that income year--so much of the amount (also an **_accrual amount_**) worked out under subsection (2) for that luxury car lease payment period as may appropriately be related to that income year in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles.

    * (2) The amount is:

    * where: 

    * **_implicit interest rate_** is the implicit interest rate under the lease for the *luxury car lease payment period, taking into account the payments to be made by the lessee under the lease and any *termination amounts.

    * **_outstanding notional loan principal at the start of the lease payment period_** is:

      * (a) the sum of the notional loan principal and the accrual amounts for earlier *luxury car lease payment periods; less

      * (b) the sum of the *luxury car lease payments that the lessee was required to make before the start of the relevant luxury car lease payment period.

    * Excessive periods

    * (3) If, apart from this subsection, a *luxury car lease payment period for the lease of a *car would exceed 6 months, this Division applies as if each of the following were a separate luxury car lease payment period:

      * (a) the first 6 months of the original luxury car lease payment period;

      * (b) if the original luxury car lease payment period was not longer than 12 months--the remaining part of the original luxury car lease payment period;

      * (c) if the original luxury car lease payment period was longer than 12 months--each successive 6 month period in the original luxury car lease payment period;

      * (d) the period (if any) after the end of the last of the periods to which paragraph (c) applies.

##### 24240  Treatment of lease payments

    * (1) The *luxury car lease payments under the lease are not assessable income and are not *exempt income of the lessor.

          * Note: Those lease payments are instead taken into account in calculating accrual amounts that are included in the lessor's assessable income under section 24235.

    * (2) In working out the amounts the lessor can deduct for any income year, ignore the fact that subsection (1) makes the *luxury car lease payments *nonassessable nonexempt income.

          * Note: This allows the lessor to continue to deduct amounts related to earning the lease payments (such as interest on an amount the lessor borrowed to acquire the car), just as if the amounts related to earning interest on the notional loan to the lessee.

##### Subdivision 242C--Deductions allowable to lessee

##### Guide to Subdivision 242C

##### 24245  What this Subdivision is about

    * The lessee is entitled to deduct the interest on the notional loan to the same extent that the lessee would have been able to deduct the lease payments apart from this Division.

##### Table of sections

       * 24250	Extent to which deductions are allowable to lessee

       * 24255	Lease payments not deductible

##### Operative provisions

##### 24250  Extent to which deductions are allowable to lessee

    * (1) If a *luxury car lease payment period for the lease of a *car occurs wholly during an income year of the lessee, the lessee can deduct the accrual amount for that period for that income year.

          * Note 1: If a luxury car lease payment period would otherwise be longer than 6 months, subsection 24235(3) divides the original period into periods of no longer than 6 months.

          * Note 2: For **_accrual amount_**, see subsection 24235(1).

    * (2) If part of a *luxury car lease payment period for the lease of a *car occurs during an income year of the lessee, the lessee can deduct so much of the accrual amount for that period as may appropriately be related to that income year in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles.

    * (3) The lessee can deduct an accrual amount, or part of an accrual amount, for a *luxury car lease payment period under subsection (1) or (2) for an income year only to the extent that the lessee could deduct the luxury car lease payments made for that year apart from this Division.

##### 24255  Lease payments not deductible

    * The lessee cannot deduct the *luxury car lease payments that the lessee makes under the lease for any income year.

          * Note: Those payments are instead taken into account in calculating accrual amounts that are deductible under section 24250.

##### Subdivision 242D--Adjustments if total amount assessed to lessor differs from amount of interest

##### Guide to Subdivision 242D

##### 24260  What this Subdivision is about

    * When a luxury car lease is extended, renewed or ends, the overall nominal gain to the lessor is compared to the nominal interest so far paid under the lease.

    * If the overall nominal gain is greater, the difference is assessable income of the lessor, and the lessee may be able to deduct it.

    * If the overall nominal gain is less, the lessor can deduct the difference, which may also be assessable income of the lessee.

    * This process ensures that the right amount has been taxed over the term of the lease.

##### Operative provisions

##### 24265  Adjustments for lessor

    * (1) This section applies at the following times:

      * (a) if the term of the lease is extended--when the extension takes effect;

      * (b) if the lease is renewed--when the renewal takes effect;

      * (c) when the lease (including any extension or renewal of the lease) ends.

    * (2) If the sum of all amounts (whether *luxury car lease payments, a *termination amount or any other payments) that were paid or payable to the lessor under the lease exceeds the amount worked out under subsection (4), the excess is included in the lessor's assessable income for the income year in which the relevant time occurs.

          * Note: Subsection 24280(8) treats the amount of a notional loan that is taken to be made by an extended or renewed lease to be a termination amount paid under the previous lease.

    * (3) If the sum of all amounts (whether *luxury car lease payments, a *termination amount or any other payments) that were paid or payable to the lessor under the lease is less than the amount worked out under subsection (4), the lessor can deduct the difference for the income year in which the relevant time occurs.

    * (4) The amount for the purposes of subsections (2) and (3) is the sum of:

      * (a) the notional loan principal; and

      * (b) the sum of the accrual amounts that have been or are to be included in the lessor's assessable income of any income year.

          * Note: For **_accrual amount_**, see subsection 24235(1).

##### 24270  Adjustments for lessee

    * (1) If:

      * (a) an amount is included in the lessor's assessable income for an income year under subsection 24265(2); or

      * (b) an amount would have been so included if the lessor had been subject to tax on assessable income;

    * the lessee can deduct a corresponding amount for the same income year.

    * (2) If:

      * (a) the lessor can deduct an amount for an income year under subsection 24265(3); or

      * (b) the lessor could have deducted an amount under that subsection if the lessor had been subject to tax on assessable income;

    * a corresponding amount is included in the lessee's assessable income for the same income year.

    * (3) The lessee cannot deduct an amount for any income year under subsection (1), and an amount is not included in the lessee's assessable income of any income year under subsection (2), except to the extent (if any) that the lessee could deduct the *luxury car lease payments made apart from this Division.

##### Subdivision 242E--Extension, renewal and final ending of the lease

##### Guide to Subdivision 242E

##### 24275  What this Subdivision is about

    * When a luxury car lease ends (whether it expires or is terminated before its expiry date), one of 3 things will happen:

          * (a) if the lease is extended or renewed--the original notional loan is treated as having been repaid and the lessor is treated as having made a new loan to the lessee; or

          * (b) if the lessee acquires the car from the lessor--the lessee continues to own the car for tax purposes, and the actual transfer and the termination payment to acquire the car are ignored for tax purposes; or

          * (c) if the lessee's right to use the car ends--the lessee is treated as having sold the car back to the lessor.

    * In each case, there may be adjustments under Subdivision 242D to ensure that the right amount has been taxed over the term of the lease.

       * 24285	What happens if an amount is paid by the lessee to acquire the car

       * 24290	What happens if the lessee stops having the right to use the car

##### Operative provisions

##### 24280  What happens if the term of the lease is extended or the lease is renewed

    * (1) The rules in this section have effect if, after the end of the lease (or the end of any extension of the lease term or renewal of the lease), the lessee continues to have the *right to use the *car because the term of the lease is extended (or further extended) or the lease is renewed (or further renewed).

    * (2) This Act has effect as if the lessee continued to be the owner of the *car until the end of the lease as extended or renewed.

    * (3) However, this Act has effect as if the lessee stopped being the owner of the *car if:

      * (a) the lessee enters into a sublease in respect of the car; and

      * (b) this Division applies to the car in respect of that sublease.

    * (4) This Act has effect as if the notional loan that arose because of the grant of the lease, or because of the previous extension or renewal, had been repaid.

          * Note: Also, Subdivision 242D (about balancing adjustments) will apply to the ending, extension or renewal.

    * (5) This Act has effect as if, on the grant of the extension or renewal, the lessor had made a new loan (the **_notional loan_**) to the lessee:

      * (a) for the period of the extension of the term of the lease or the period of the renewed lease, as the case may be; and

      * (b) of an amount (the **_notional loan principal_**) equal to the *car's *market value when the extension or renewal is granted; and

      * (c) subject to the payment of interest.

    * (6) This Act has effect as if the notional loan principal were repaid, and the interest were paid, by the making of the *luxury car lease payments under the lease as extended or renewed (or further extended or renewed).

    * (7) In determining whether subsection (1) applies to the lessee, disregard any period after the end of the lease (or the end of any extension of the lease term or renewal of the lease) and before the extension or renewal (or further extension or renewal) is granted and during which the lessee did not have the *right to use the *car if the extension or renewal (or further extension or renewal):

      * (a) has effect from the time immediately after the end of that term, extension or renewal; or

      * (b) otherwise results in substantial continuity of the leasing of the car to the lessee.

    * (8) The amount of the notional loan is treated, for the purposes of section 24265 (about the lessor's balancing adjustments), as a *termination amount paid to the lessor under the lease or under the previous extension or renewal.

##### 24285  What happens if an amount is paid by the lessee to acquire the car

    * If, at the end of the lease or, if it is extended or renewed, at the end of any extension or renewal (the **_end time_**), an amount is paid to the lessor by, or on behalf of, the lessee to acquire the *car, the following provisions have effect:

      * (a) the amount paid is not included in the lessor's assessable income;

      * (b) the lessee cannot deduct the payment;

      * (c) this Act has effect as if:

        * (i) the lessee continued to be the owner of the car until the lessee disposes of it; and

        * (ii) the transfer to the lessee of legal title to the car were not a disposal of the car by the lessor.

##### 24290  What happens if the lessee stops having the right to use the car

    * (1) If, at the end time:

      * (a) the lessee stops having the *right to use the *car; and

      * (b) no amount is paid to the lessor by, or on behalf of, the lessee to acquire the car;

    * the following provisions have effect.

          * Note: For **_end time_**, see section 24285.

    * (2) This Act has effect as if the *car:

      * (a) were sold by the lessee to the lessor; and

      * (b) were acquired by the lessor;

    * at the end time.

    * (3) The consideration for the sale of the *car by the lessee, and the first element of the *cost of the car to the lessor, are the *market value of the car at the end time.

    * (4) If the *car is afterwards acquired by an *associate of the lessee or an employer or employee of the lessee, this Act has effect as if the first element of the *cost of the car as a *depreciating asset were the lesser of:

      * (a) the sum of:

        * (i) the amount that would have been the *adjustable value of the car at that time for the purposes of applying this Act to the lessee if the lessee were not treated under this Division as having disposed of the car; and

        * (ii) any amount that is included in the lessee's assessable income under section 40285 as a balancing adjustment because the lessee is treated as having disposed of the car; and

      * (b) the cost of the acquisition of the car by the associate, employer or employee.

          * Note: Section 24220 of the _Income Tax (Transitional Provisions) Act 1997_ extends subparagraph (a)(ii) to cover amounts included in assessable income under former provisions corresponding to section 40285.

    * (5) For the purposes of paragraph (1)(a), the lessee is not treated as having stopped to have the *right to use the *car if:

      * (a) the term of the lease is extended (or further extended), or the lease is renewed (or further renewed), at a time after, but not immediately after, the end of that term, extension or renewal with effect from the time immediately after that end; or

      * (b) the extension or renewal (or further extension or renewal) otherwise results in substantial continuity of the leasing of the car to the lessee.

##### Guide to Division 243

##### 24310  What this Division is about

    * This Division tells you when you must include an additional amount in your assessable income at the termination of a limited recourse debt arrangement. It also tells you what the additional amount is.

    * Basically, the Division applies where the capital allowance deductions that have been obtained for expenditure that is funded by the debt and the deductions are excessive having regard to the amount of the debt that was repaid.

    * The reason for the adjustment is to ensure that, where you have not been fully at risk in relation to an amount of expenditure, you do not get a net deduction if you fail to pay that amount.

       * 24325	When is a debt arrangement terminated?

       * 24330	What is the financed property and the debt property?

##### Operative provisions

##### 24315  When does this Division apply?

    * (1) This Division applies if:

      * (a) *limited recourse debt has been used to wholly or partly finance or refinance expenditure; and

      * (b) at the time that the debt *arrangement is terminated, the debt has not been paid in full by the debtor; and

      * (c) the debtor can deduct an amount as a *capital allowance for the income year in which the termination occurs, or has deducted or can deduct an amount for an earlier income year, in respect of the expenditure or the *financed property.

          * Note: This Division does not apply to certain limited recourse debts that are used to refinance limited recourse debt to which this Division has applied (see subsection 24350(4)).

    * (2) However, unless the net *capital allowance deductions have been excessive having regard to the amount of the debt that remains unpaid (see section 24335), no amount is included in the debtor's assessable income under this Division although future deductions may be reduced.

    * (3) In working out if the debt has been paid in full, and in working out the unpaid amount of the debt, the following amounts are to be treated as if they were not payments in respect of the debt:

      * (a) any reduction in the debt as a result of the *financed property being surrendered or returned to the creditor at the termination of the debt;

      * (b) any payment to reduce the debt that is funded directly or indirectly by *nonarm's length limited recourse debt or by proceeds from the disposal of the debtor's interest in the financed property.

    * However, any amounts accrued that are interest, *notional interest or in the nature of interest are taken not to be unpaid.

    * (4) In working out if the debt has been paid in full, and in working out the unpaid amount of the debt, payments are to be attributed first to the payment of any accrued amounts that are interest, *notional interest or in the nature of interest.

    * (5) A notional loan arising because of Division 240 (about arrangements treated as a sale and loan) is taken to be a debt that has been used to wholly or partly finance or refinance expenditure.

##### 24320  What is limited recourse debt?

    * (1) A **_limited recourse debt_** is an obligation imposed by law on an entity (the **_debtor_**) to pay an amount to another entity (the **_creditor_**) where the rights of the creditor as against the debtor in the event of default in payment of the debt or of interest are limited wholly or predominantly to any or all of the following:

      * (a) rights (including the right to money payable) in relation to any or all of the following:

        * (i) the *debt property or the use of the debt property;

        * (ii) goods produced, supplied, carried, transmitted or delivered, or services provided, by means of the debt property;

        * (iii) the loss or disposal of the whole or a part of the debt property or of the debtor's interest in the debt property;

      * (b) rights in respect of a mortgage or other security over the debt property or other property;

      * (c) rights that arise out of any *arrangement relating to the financial obligations of an enduser of the *financed property towards the debtor, and are financial obligations in relation to the financed property.

    * (2) An obligation imposed by law on an entity (the **_debtor_**) to pay an amount to another entity (the **_creditor_**) is also a **_limited recourse debt_** if it is reasonable to conclude that the rights of the creditor as against the debtor in the event of default in payment of the debt or of interest:

      * (a) are capable of being limited in the way mentioned in subsection (1); or

      * (b) are in substance or effect limited wholly or predominantly to rights (including the right to money payable) in relation to any or all of the following:

        * (i) the *debt property or the use of the debt property;

        * (ii) goods produced, supplied, carried, transmitted or delivered, or services provided, by means of the debt property;

        * (iii) the loss or disposal of the whole or a part of the debt property or of the debtor's interest in the debt property.

          * Note: Paragraph (b) could apply to a special purpose entity. For example, an entity's only significant asset is one that it financed by way of a bank loan. The bank's rights to recover the debt (if the entity defaults) are not contractually limited, however they are in effect limited to rights in relation to the asset.

    * (3) An obligation imposed by law on an entity (the **_debtor_**) to pay an amount to another entity (the **_creditor_**) is also a **_limited recourse debt_** if there is no *debt property and it is reasonable to conclude that the rights of the creditor as against the debtor in the event of default in payment of the debt or of interest are capable of being limited.

    * (3A) In reaching a conclusion for the purposes of subsection (2) or (3), have regard to the following:

      * (a) the debtor's assets (other than assets that are indemnities or guarantees provided in relation to the debt);

      * (b) any *arrangement to which the debtor is a party;

      * (c) except for the purposes of paragraph (2)(b)--whether all of the debtor's assets would be available for the purpose of discharging the debt (other than assets that are security for other debts of the debtor or any other entity);

      * (d) whether the debtor and creditor are dealing at *arm's length in relation to the debt.

    * (4) A notional loan arising because of Division 240 (about arrangements treated as a sale and loan) under a *hire purchase agreement is also a **_limited recourse debt_**.

    * (5) However, an obligation that is covered by subsection (1) is not a limited recourse debt if the creditor's recourse is not in practice limited due to the creditor's rights in respect of a mortgage or other security over property of the debtor (other than the financed property) the value of which exceeds, or is likely to exceed, the amount of the debt.

    * (6) Also, an obligation that is covered by subsection (1), (2) or (3) is not a limited recourse debt if, having regard to all relevant circumstances, it would be unreasonable for the obligation to be treated as limited recourse debt.

    * (7) A *limited recourse debt is a **_nonarm's length limited recourse debt_** if the debtor and creditor do not deal with each other at *arm's length in relation to the debt.

##### 24325  When is a debt arrangement terminated?

    * (1) A debt arrangement is taken to have terminated if:

      * (a) it is actually terminated; or

      * (b) the debtor's obligation to repay the debt is waived, novated or otherwise varied so as to reduce, transfer or extinguish the debt; or

      * (c) an agreement is entered into to waive, novate or otherwise vary the debtor's obligation to repay the debt so as to reduce, transfer or extinguish the debt; or

      * (d) the creditor ceases to have an entitlement to recover the debt from the debtor (other than as a result of an *arm's length assignment of some or all of the creditor's rights under the debt arrangement); or

      * (e) the debtor ceases to be the owner or the *quasiowner of some or all of the *debt property because that property is surrendered to the creditor because of the debtor's failure to pay the whole or a part of the debt; or

      * (f) the debtor ceases to be the owner of a beneficial interest in some or all of the debt property because the interest is surrendered to the creditor because of the debtor's failure to pay the whole or a part of the debt; or

      * (g) the debt becomes a bad debt.

    * (2) However, a debt arrangement that is a notional loan arising because of Division 240 (about arrangements treated as a sale and loan) is not taken to have terminated merely because it has been renewed or extended.

          * Note: Under Division 240, notional loans are taken to have ended if the relevant arrangement is renewed or extended.

    * (3) Where a debt is terminated under paragraph (1)(b) or (c) as a result of the debt being reduced, the remaining debt is taken to be a new debt to which section 24315 applies.

##### 24330  What is the financed property and the debt property?

    * (1) Property is the **_financed property_** if the expenditure referred to in paragraph 24315(1)(a) is on the property, is on the acquisition of the property, results in the creation of the property or is otherwise connected with the property.

    * (2) If the debt agreement is a notional loan arising under Division 240 (about arrangements treated as a sale and loan), the property that is the subject of the agreement is the **_financed property_**.

    * (3) Property is the **_debt property_** if:

      * (a) it is the *financed property; or

      * (b) the property is provided as security for the debt.

##### Subdivision 243B--Working out the excessive deductions

##### Table of sections

  * Operative provisions

       * 24335	Working out the excessive deductions

##### Operative provisions

##### 24335  Working out the excessive deductions

    * (1) The *capital allowance deductions have been excessive having regard to the amount of the debt that remains unpaid if the amount worked out under subsection (2) exceeds the amount worked out under subsection (4).

    * (2) This is how to work out the total net *capital allowance deductions:

Working out the total net capital allowance deductions

        * Step 1.	Add up all of the debtor's *capital allowance deductions in respect of the expenditure or the *financed property (including deductions because of balancing adjustments) for the income year in which the termination occurs or an earlier income year.

             * Note: The amount of a capital allowance deduction may be reduced under section 707415.

        * Step 2.	Deduct from that any amount that is included in the assessable income of the debtor of any income year by virtue of a provision of this Act (other than this Division) as a result of the disposal of the *financed property the effect of which is to reverse a deduction covered by Step 1.

        * Step 3.	Deduct from the result an amount equal to the sum of any amounts included in the entity's assessable income as a result of an earlier application of this Division to the debt.

        * Step 4.	Add to the result an amount equal to the sum of any deductions to which the entity is entitled under section 24345 (repayments of the original debt after termination) or 24350 (repayments of the replacement debt) because of payments in respect of the debt.

    * (3) The reference in step 2 of the method statement in subsection (2) to an amount that is included in the assessable income of a taxpayer as a result of the disposal of the *financed property includes a reference to an amount that is included under section 26AG of the _Income Tax Assessment Act 1936_ as a result of the disposal of the financed property.

          * Note: Division 20 deals with amounts included to reverse the effect of past deductions.

    * (4) This is how to work out the total net capital allowance deductions that would otherwise be allowable taking into account the amount of the debt that is unpaid:

Working out the total net capital allowance deductions that would otherwise be allowable

    * Work out the amount that would be worked out under subsection (2) if the deductions and the amounts included in assessable income had been calculated using the following assumptions:

      * (1) The original expenditure in respect of which deductions were calculated was reduced by the amount of the debt that was unpaid by the debtor when the debt was terminated. (In calculating the amount unpaid the following are to be disregarded:

          * (a) any reduction in the amount as a result of the *financed property being surrendered or returned to the creditor at the termination of the debt;

          * (b) any reduction in the amount to the extent that it is funded directly or indirectly by *nonarm's length limited recourse debt or by the consideration for the disposal of the debtor's interest in the financed property.)

      * (2) Deductions for income years after the income year in which the termination occurred were also taken into account.

      * (3) The original expenditure in respect of which deductions were calculated was increased by any amount that is paid by the debtor as consideration for another person assuming a liability under the debt. (This assumption does not apply to the extent that the consideration is funded directly or indirectly by *nonarm's length limited recourse debt or by the consideration for the disposal of the debtor's interest in the *financed property.)

      * (4) Step 2 were omitted from subsection (2).

##### Operative provisions

##### 24340  Amount included in debtor's assessable income

    * The debtor's assessable income for the income year in which the termination occurs is to include the excess referred to in subsection 24335(1).

          * Note: Section 24360 applies in relation to certain partnership debts.

##### 24345  Deduction for later payments in respect of debt

    * (1) This section applies if:

      * (a) an amount was included in the debtor's assessable income under section 24340 or a deduction was reduced under section 24355; and

      * (b) the debtor makes a payment to the creditor, after the termination of the debt arrangement, in respect of the debt (other than an amount to the extent to which it is a payment of interest, of *notional interest or in the nature of interest).

    * (2) This is how to work out the amount of the deduction:

Working out the amount of the deduction

        * Step 1.	Work out the amount that would be worked out under subsection 24335(2) if the debt were terminated immediately before the payment.

        * Step 2.	Work out the amount that would have been worked out under subsection 24335(4) at that time if the payment had been taken into account.

        * Step 3.	The **_amount of the deduction_** is the amount (if any) by which the amount worked out under Step 2 exceeds the amount worked out under Step 1.

    * (3) The amount can be deducted for the income year in which the payment is made.

    * Limit on deductions

    * (4) The total amounts deducted under this section in respect of a debt, and under section 24350 in respect of a replacement debt, cannot exceed the sum of:

      * (a) any amounts included in the debtor's assessable income under this Division in respect of the original debt; and

      * (b) any amount by which deductions in respect of the original debt were reduced under section 24355.

##### 24350  Deduction for payments for replacement debt

    * Payments where debt refinanced

    * (1) This section applies if:

      * (a) an amount was included in the debtor's assessable income under section 24340 or a deduction was reduced under section 24355; and

      * (b) an amount funded by a *nonarm's length limited recourse debt (the **_replacement debt_**) was disregarded in calculations under subsection 24335(4); and

      * (c) the debtor makes a payment, after the termination of the original debt arrangement, in respect of the replacement debt (other than to the extent to which it is a payment of interest, of *notional interest or in the nature of interest).

    * (2) This is how to work out the amount of the deduction:

Working out the amount of the deduction

        * Step 1.	Work out the amount that would be worked out under subsection 24335(2) if the replacement debt were terminated immediately before the payment.

        * Step 2.	Work out the amount that would have been worked out under subsection 24335(4) at that time if the payment had been made in respect of the original debt and it had been taken into account.

        * Step 3.	The **_amount of the deduction_** is the amount (if any) by which the amount worked out under Step 2 exceeds the amount worked out under Step 1.

    * (3) The amount can be deducted for the income year in which the payment is made.

    * Division not to apply to termination of replacement debt

    * (4) This Division does not apply to termination of the replacement debt referred to in paragraph (1)(b).

    * Limit on deductions

    * (5) The total amounts deducted under section 24345 in respect of the original debt, or under this section in respect of the replacement debt, cannot exceed the sum of:

      * (a) any amounts included in the debtor's assessable income under this Division in respect of the original debt; and

      * (b) any amount by which deductions in respect of the original debt were reduced under section 24355.

##### 24355  Effect of Division on later capital allowance deductions

    * (1) This section applies where this Division (other than section 24365) has applied in relation to a debt and the debtor is entitled to a *capital allowance deduction in respect of the expenditure or the *financed property in relation to a time or period after the termination of the debt.

    * (2) The *capital allowance deduction is reduced if the amount that would have been worked out under subsection 24335(2) would have exceeded the amount worked out under subsection 24335(4) if the following assumptions were applied in both subsections:

Assumptions to be applied

      * (1) That the debt was terminated at the time, or at the end of the period, referred to in subsection (1) of this section.

      * (2) That the amount unpaid at the time, or at the end of the period, is reduced by any amounts paid under a replacement debt.

      * (3) The debtor's *capital allowance deductions in respect of the expenditure or the *financed property were increased by the amount of the capital allowance deduction referred to in subsection (1) of this section.

    * (3) The deduction is to be reduced by the amount of the excess.

##### 24357  Effect of Division on later capital allowance balancing adjustments

    * (1) This section applies where this Division (other than section 24365) has applied in relation to a debt and an amount is later included in the assessable income of an entity by virtue of a provision of this Act (other than this Division) as a result of the disposal of the *financed property the effect of which is to reverse a deduction covered by Step 1 in subsection 24335(2).

    * (2) Any amount that would be included in the debtor's assessable income is reduced if the amount that would have been worked out under subsection 24335(4) would have exceeded the amount worked out under subsection 24335(2) if the following assumptions were applied in both subsections:

Assumptions to be applied

      * (1) That the debt was terminated at the time of the disposal of the *financed property, referred to in subsection (1) of this section.

      * (2) The amount in Step 2 in subsection 24335(2) were increased by the amount that would otherwise be included in the debtor's assessable income.

      * (3) The amount worked out under subsection 24335(4) were reduced by any amount by which:

          * (a) the amount arising as a result of the disposal that is taken into account for the purposes of the provision mentioned in subsection (1);

      * exceeds: 

          * (b) the unpaid amount of the debt immediately before the time of the disposal of the *financed property, referred to in subsection (1).

    * (3) The amount is to be reduced by the amount of the excess.

##### 24358  Adjustment where debt only partially used for expenditure

    * If the debt is only partially used to finance the expenditure, or the property, in respect of which the *capital allowance deductions referred to in Step 1 in subsection 24335(2) are allowed, the amount of any deduction, any reduction in a deduction or any amount included in assessable income is to be so much as is reasonable taking into account the proportion of the debt that is used for that purpose.

       * 24375	Application of Division where debt forgiveness rules also apply

##### Operative provisions

##### 24360  Application of Division to partnerships

    * This Division applies to a partnership in respect of the partnership's debts and in respect of debts of a partner, and references to a debtor include a reference to a partnership.

##### 24365  Application where partner reduces liability

    * (1) This section applies to a debt in relation to a partner in a partnership if:

      * (a) in connection with an *arrangement, the partner's liability to pay the debt is reduced or eliminated and the partner's interest in the partnership ceases or is varied or transferred; and

      * (b) an excess would have been worked out under subsection 24335(1) if, at the time when the debt is reduced or eliminated, the debt had been terminated and remained unpaid and this section had not applied.

    * (2) If this section applies to a debt in relation to a partner in a partnership, an amount is to be included in his or her assessable income.

    * (3) This is how to work out the amount to be included:

Working out the amount included

        * Step 1.	Work out which income years the partner was a member of the partnership and the partnership was entitled to a *capital allowance deduction in respect of the expenditure or the *financed property (including deductions because of balancing adjustments).

        * Step 2.	For each of those income years, work out the proportion of net income of the partnership or the partnership loss (as the case requires) that was included in the assessable income of the partner or which the partner could deduct.

        * Step 3.	For each of those income years, multiply the *capital allowance deductions in respect of the expenditure or the *financed property (including deductions because of balancing adjustments) of the partnership by the corresponding proportion worked out under Step 2. Sum all of the amounts.

        * Step 4.	Divide the sum by the total of the *capital allowance deductions in respect of the expenditure or the *financed property (including deductions because of balancing adjustments) of the partnership for all of those income years.

        * Step 5.	Work out the amount that would have been included in the partnership's assessable income under section 24340 if the debt had been terminated and remained unpaid and this section had not applied.

        * Step 6.	Multiply the amount worked out in Step 5 by the factor worked out in Step 4. The result is the amount to be included in the partner's assessable income.

##### 24370  Application of Division to companies ceasing to be 100% subsidiary

    * (1) This section applies to a company if:

      * (a) the company ceases to be a *100% subsidiary in relation to at least one other company; and

      * (b) at that time, the company is the debtor for a *limited recourse debt that has not been paid in full by the company; and

      * (c) the creditor's rights under the debt are transferred or assigned to another entity.

    * (2) If this section applies, this Division applies as if the debt were terminated, and refinanced with *nonarm's length limited recourse debt, at the time the company ceased to be a *100% subsidiary of that other company.

##### 24375  Application of Division where debt forgiveness rules also apply

    * (1) This section is to remove doubt about how this Division and Division 245 apply where both apply to the same debt.

    * (2) Where both apply:

      * (a) this Division is to be applied first and is to be applied disregarding any operation of Division 245; and

      * (b) any amounts included in assessable income under this Division are taken into account under paragraph 24585(1)(a).

##### Guide to Division 245

##### 2451  What this Division is about

    * When a creditor forgives a commercial debt you owe, you make a gain. This is usually not included in your assessable income. Instead, this Division offsets the forgiven amount against amounts that could otherwise reduce your taxable income in the same or a later income year. Those amounts are:

          * (a) your tax losses and net capital losses; and

          * (b) capital allowances and some similar deductions; and

          * (c) the cost bases of your CGT assets.

##### 2452  Simplified outline of this Division

    * (1) This Division applies to any commercial debt (or part of a commercial debt) you owe that is forgiven.

          * Note: This Division does not apply if:

           * (a) the debt is waived and the waiver constitutes a fringe benefit; or

           * (b) the amount of the debt has been, or will be, included in your assessable income in any income year; or

           * (c) the debt is forgiven under an Act relating to bankruptcy; or

           * (d) the debt is forgiven by will; or

           * (e) the debt is forgiven for reasons of natural love and affection; or

           * (f) the debt is a taxrelated liability.

    * (2) The net forgiven amount of a debt is worked out by reducing the value of your forgiven debt by:

      * (a) any consideration you provided for the forgiveness; and

      * (b) any amounts that this Act already brings to account because of the forgiveness.

    * (3) The net forgiven amounts of all your forgiven debts in an income year are added up. This total net forgiven amount is applied to reduce the following amounts (in the following order):

      * (a) your tax losses from previous income years;

      * (b) your net capital losses from previous income years;

      * (c) the deductions you would otherwise get in the income year, or in a later year, because of expenditure from a previous year (e.g. the capital allowance deductions you would get for the cost of a depreciating asset);

      * (d) the cost bases of your CGT assets.

    * (4) Any unapplied total net forgiven amount is disregarded.

    * (5) Special rules apply to debts of partnerships.

       * 24520	Parts of debts

##### Application of Division

##### 24510  Commercial debts

    * Subdivisions 245C to 245G apply to a debt of yours if: 

      * (a) the whole or any part of interest, or of an amount in the nature of interest, paid or payable by you in respect of the debt has been deducted, or can be deducted, by you; or

      * (b) interest, or an amount in the nature of interest, is not payable by you in respect of the debt but, had interest or such an amount been payable, the whole or any part of the interest or amount could have been deducted by you; or

      * (c) interest or an amount mentioned in paragraph (a) or (b) could have been deducted by you apart from the operation of a provision of this Act (other than paragraphs 81(2)(a), (b) and (c)) that has the effect of preventing a deduction.

          * Note: Paragraphs 81(2)(a), (b) and (c) prevent deductions for capital, private or domestic outgoings and for outgoings relating to exempt income or nonassessable nonexempt income.

##### 24515  Nonequity shares

    * This Division applies to a *nonequity share issued by a company as if it were a debt to which section 24510 applies that is owed by the company to the relevant shareholder.

##### 24520  Parts of debts

    * This Division applies to part of a debt in the same way as it applies to a whole debt.

          * Note: This Division treats interest, or an amount in the nature of interest, payable on a debt as being a separate debt if the interest or amount has accrued but has not been paid.

##### Subdivision 245B--What constitutes forgiveness of a debt

##### Guide to Subdivision 245B

##### 24530  What this Subdivision is about

    * A debt is **_forgiven_** if you no longer have to pay it.

    * However, this Division does not apply to some cases of forgiveness, such as bankruptcy.

       * 24545	Application of operative rules if forgiveness involves an arrangement

##### Operative provisions

##### 24535  What constitutes forgiveness of a debt

    * A debt is **_forgiven_** if and when:

      * (a) the debtor's obligation to pay the debt is released or waived, or is otherwise extinguished other than by repaying the debt in full; or

      * (b) the period within which the creditor is entitled to sue for the recovery of the debt ends, because of the operation of a statute of limitations, without the debt having been paid.

##### 24536  What constitutes forgiveness of a debt if the debt is assigned

    * A debt is **_forgiven_** if and when the creditor assigns the right to receive payment of the debt to another entity (the **_new creditor_**) and the following conditions are met:

      * (a) either the new creditor is the debtor's *associate or the assignment occurred under an *arrangement to which the new creditor and debtor were parties;

      * (b) the right to receive payment of the debt was not acquired by the new creditor in the ordinary course of *trading on a market, exchange or other place on which, or facility by means of which, offers to sell, buy or exchange securities (within the meaning of Division 16E of Part III of the _Income Tax Assessment Act 1936_) are made or accepted.

          * Note 1: Division 16E of Part III of the _Income Tax Assessment Act 1936_ brings to account gains and losses on some securities on an accruals basis.

          * Note 2: This Division also applies if an assigned debt is subsequently forgiven by the new creditor. Section 24561 tells you how to work out the value of the debt in that case.

##### 24537  What constitutes forgiveness of a debt if a subscription for shares enables payment of the debt

    * If an entity subscribes for *shares in a company to enable the company to make a payment in or towards discharge of a debt it owes to the entity, the debt is **_forgiven_** when, and to the extent that, the company applies any of the money subscribed in or towards payment of the debt.

##### 24540  Forgivenesses to which operative rules do not apply

    * Subdivisions 245C to 245G do not apply to a *forgiveness of a debt if:

      * (a) the debt is waived and the waiver constitutes a *fringe benefit; or

           * Note: The waiver by an employer of a debt owed by an employee is usually a fringe benefit: see section 14 of the _Fringe Benefits Tax Assessment Act 1986_.

      * (b) the amount of the debt has been, or will be, included in the assessable income of the debtor in any income year; or

      * (c) the forgiveness is effected under an Act relating to bankruptcy; or

      * (d) the forgiveness is effected by will; or

      * (e) the forgiveness is for reasons of natural love and affection; or

      * (f) the debt is a *taxrelated liability or a civil penalty under Division 290 in Schedule 1 to the _Taxation Administration Act 1953_ (about penalties for promoters and implementers of tax avoidance schemes).

          * Note: If the forgiveness of your debt involved an arrangement which was entered into before 28 June 1996, see section 24510 of the _Income Tax (Transitional Provisions) Act 1997_.

##### 24545  Application of operative rules if forgiveness involves an arrangement

    * (1) If:

      * (a) the debtor and the creditor in relation to a debt enter into an *arrangement; and

      * (b) under the arrangement, the debtor's obligation to pay the debt is to cease at a particular future time; and

      * (c) the cessation of the obligation is to occur without the debtor incurring any financial or other obligation (other than an obligation that, having regard to the debtor's circumstances, is of a nominal or insignificant amount or kind);

    * Subdivisions 245C to 245G apply as if the debt were *forgiven when the arrangement is entered into.

    * (2) If, after the arrangement is entered into, the debt is forgiven, the later forgiveness is disregarded for the purposes of those Subdivisions.

##### Subdivision 245C--Calculation of gross forgiven amount of a debt

##### Guide to Subdivision 245C

##### 24548  What this Subdivision is about

    * The amount of forgiveness (called the gross forgiven amount) for the debtor reflects the loss that the creditor makes for tax purposes. It is worked out in 2 steps:

          * (a) the value of the debt when it was forgiven is worked out on the basis that you were solvent both then and when you incurred the debt; and

          * (b) the value of the debt is then offset by any consideration given for the forgiveness of the debt.

    * The difference between the value of the debt and the amount offset is the gross forgiven amount.

    * If the debt was owed by several debtors, the gross forgiven amount is divided between them equally_._

##### Working out the value of a debt

##### 24550  Extent of forgiveness if consideration is given

    * If any consideration is paid or given in respect of the *forgiveness of a debt, the debt that is forgiven is:

      * (a) the obligation that existed before the forgiveness to pay so much of the debt as is expressed, or is taken, to be forgiven; and

      * (b) the obligation that existed before the forgiveness to pay any part of the debt to which paragraph (a) does not apply but which ceases to be payable as a result of the payment or giving of the consideration.

          * Example: Daniel owes Samara $100. Samara agrees to accept $60 in full payment of the debt.

          * If their agreement specifies that Samara forgives the whole debt in return for $60, paragraph (a) provides that the forgiven debt is $100.

          * If their agreement instead requires Daniel to repay $60 and specifies that Samara forgives the remaining $40, paragraph (a) would deal with the $40 and paragraph (b) would add the remaining $60, again producing a forgiven amount of $100.

          * In either case, the $60 Daniel pays is offset against the forgiven amount of $100 in working out the gross forgiven amount of the debt: see sections 24565 and 24575.

##### 24555  General rule for working out the value of a debt

    * (1) The value of your debt at the time (the **_forgiveness time_**) when it is *forgiven is the amount that would have been its *market value (considered as an asset of the creditor) at the forgiveness time, assuming that:

      * (a) when you incurred the debt, you were able to pay all your debts (including that one) as and when they fell due; and

      * (b) your capacity to pay the debt is the same at the forgiveness time as when you incurred it.

    * (2) However, the value of the debt at the forgiveness time is the sum of the following amounts, if that sum is less than the amount applicable under subsection (1):

      * (a) what would have been the amount applicable under subsection (1) if there had been no change, from the time the debt was incurred until the forgiveness time, in any rate of interest, or rate of exchange between currencies, that affects the *market value of the debt;

      * (b) each amount:

        * (i) that you have deducted or can deduct as a result of the *forgiveness of the debt; and

        * (ii) that is attributable to such a change.

    * (3) Paragraph (1)(a) does not apply to the debt if:

      * (a) either:

        * (i) the creditor was an Australian resident at the forgiveness time; or

        * (ii) the *forgiveness of the debt was a *CGT event involving a *CGT asset that was *taxable Australian property; and

      * (b) you and the creditor were not dealing with each other at *arm's length in respect of you incurring the debt; and

      * (c) the debt was not a *moneylending debt.

          * Note: This subsection reduces your gross forgiven amount to reflect the reduction in the creditor's loss on the forgiven debt under the capital gains tax regime.

    * (4) This section has effect subject to sections 24560 and 24561 (about nonrecourse and assigned debts).

##### 24560  Special rule for working out the value of a nonrecourse debt

    * (1) The value of a debt when it is *forgiven is the lesser of:

      * (a) the amount of the debt outstanding at that time; and

      * (b) the *market value at that time of the creditor's rights mentioned in paragraph (2)(b).

    * (2) Subsection (1) applies to a debt if:

      * (a) you incurred the debt directly in respect of financing:

        * (i) the acquisition of property by you; or

        * (ii) the construction or development of property by you;

      * (but not including the manufacture of goods); and

      * (b) the creditor's rights against you in the event of default in the payment of the debt or interest were, just before the debt was forgiven, limited to all or any of the following:

        * (i) rights (including the right to money payable) in relation to all or any of the matters mentioned in subsection (3);

        * (ii) rights in respect of a mortgage or other security over the property;

        * (iii) rights arising out of any *arrangement relating to the financial obligations, in relation to the property, of the *end user of the property to you.

    * (3) For the purposes of subparagraph (2)(b)(i), the matters are as follows:

      * (a) the property or the use of the property;

      * (b) goods produced, supplied, carried, transmitted or delivered by means of the property;

      * (c) services provided by means of the property;

      * (d) the loss or *disposal of the whole or a part of the property or of your interest in the property.

##### 24561  Special rule for working out the value of a previously assigned debt

    * If your debt has been assigned as mentioned in section 24536 and is later *forgiven by the new creditor, the value of that debt when it is later forgiven is:

      * (a) if the debt was not a *moneylending debt and the creditor and the new creditor were not dealing with each other at *arm's length in connection with the assignment--the *market value of the debt at the time of the assignment; or

      * (b) in any other case--the sum of:

        * (i) the amount or market value of the consideration (if any) you paid or gave, or are required to pay or give, to the creditor in respect of the assignment; and

        * (ii) the amount or market value of the consideration (if any) the new creditor paid or gave in respect of the assignment.

##### Working out if an amount is offset against the value of the debt

##### 24565  Amount offset against amount of debt

    * (1) The table explains how to work out the amount (if any) that is offset against the value of a debt when it is forgiven (calculated under section 24555, 24560 or 24561) in working out the *gross forgiven amount of the debt.

    * (2) The conditions for the purposes of item 3 of the table in subsection (1) are:

      * (a) at least one of the following is satisfied:

        * (i) at the time when the debt was *forgiven, the creditor was an Australian resident;

        * (ii) the forgiveness of the debt was a *CGT event involving a *CGT asset that was *taxable Australian property; and

      * (b) at least one of the following is satisfied:

        * (i) there is no amount, and no property, covered by column 2 of item 2 of the table;

        * (ii) the amount worked out under item 2 of the table is greater or less than the *market value of the debt at the time of the forgiveness and the debtor and creditor did not deal with each other at *arm's length in connection with the forgiveness.

    * (3) The formula for the purposes of item 6 of the table in subsection (1) is:

    * where: 

    * **_amount applied_** means the amount applied by the company as mentioned in section 24537.

    * **_amount subscribed_** means the amount subscribed as mentioned in section 24537.

    * **_market value of shares subscribed for_** means the *market value of all the shares in the company that were subscribed for as mentioned in section 24537, immediately after those shares were issued.

##### Working out the gross forgiven amount

##### 24575  Gross forgiven amount of a debt

    * (1) The **_gross forgiven amount_** of a debt is:

      * (a) if section 24565 does not apply to the debt--the value of the debt when it was *forgiven (worked out under section 24555, 24560 or 24561); or

      * (b) if the value of the debt when it was forgiven exceeds the amount offset under section 24565 in relation to the debt--the excess.

    * (2) If the value of the debt when it was *forgiven is equal to or less than the amount offset:

      * (a) there is no **_gross forgiven amount_** in respect of the debt; and

      * (b) Subdivisions 245D to 245F (about how to work out the net forgiven amount of a debt and how to treat it) do not apply in respect of the debt.

##### 24577  Gross forgiven amount shared between debtors

    * If 2 or more entities were liable (except as partners in a partnership) to pay a debt, whether their liability was joint or several, or joint and several, this Subdivision applies as if each entity had a *gross forgiven amount worked out using the formula:

##### Subdivision 245D--Calculation of net forgiven amount of a debt

##### Guide to Subdivision 245D

##### 24580  What this Subdivision is about

    * The net forgiven amount of a debt is worked out by subtracting, from the gross forgiven amount of the debt, any amount that this Act already takes into account for the debtor because the debt was forgiven (for example, if some part of the forgiven amount is treated as the debtor's ordinary income).

    * If the debtor and creditor were companies under common ownership, they may agree to transfer some of the net forgiven amount from the debtor to the creditor. The creditor must apply that amount to reduce the capital loss or deduction it has because of the forgiveness.

##### Table of sections

  * Operative provisions

       * 24585	Reduction of gross forgiven amount

       * 24590	Agreement between companies under common ownership for creditor to forgo capital loss or deduction

##### Operative provisions

##### 24585  Reduction of gross forgiven amount

    * (1) The *gross forgiven amount of your debt is reduced by the sum of the following amounts:

      * (a) any amount that, under a provision of this Act other than this Division, has been, or will be, included in your assessable income for any income year as a result of the *forgiveness of the debt;

      * (b) any amount by which, under a provision of this Act other than this Division, an amount you could otherwise have deducted for any income year has been, or will be, reduced as a result of the forgiveness of the debt (except a reduction under Division 727 (about indirect value shifting));

      * (c) any amount by which the *cost base of any of your *CGT assets has been, or will be, reduced under Part 31 or 33 as a result of the forgiveness of the debt.

          * Note: Paragraph (1)(c) does not cover a reduction under Division 727 (indirect value shifting) because that Division is not in Part 31 or 33.

    * (2) Subject to section 24590, the amount remaining after reducing the *gross forgiven amount under subsection (1) is the **_net forgiven amount _**of the debt.

##### 24590  Agreement between companies under common ownership for creditor to forgo capital loss or deduction

    * (1) This section applies if:

      * (a) a debt owed by a company to another company is *forgiven; and

      * (b) from the time when the debt was incurred until the time when the debt is forgiven, the companies were *under common ownership.

    * (2) If, apart from this subsection, the creditor would have made a *capital loss as a result of the *forgiveness of the debt:

      * (a) the debtor and creditor may agree that the creditor is to forgo so much of the loss as is stated in the agreement and does not exceed the amount that would be the net forgiven amount of the debt apart from this section (the **_provisional net forgiven amount_** of the debt); and

      * (b) if such an agreement is made:

        * (i) the creditor's capital loss is reduced by the agreed amount; and

        * (ii) the provisional net forgiven amount of the debt is also reduced by the agreed amount; and

        * (iii) the amount remaining after the reduction of the provisional net forgiven amount of the debt under subparagraph (ii) is the **_net forgiven amount _**of the debt.

    * (3) If, apart from this subsection, the creditor could deduct an amount in respect of the debt under section 81 (about general deductions) or section 2535 (about bad debts) for the *forgiveness income year:

      * (a) the debtor and creditor may agree that the creditor is to forgo so much of the deduction as is stated in the agreement and does not exceed the amount that would be the net forgiven amount of the debt apart from this section (the **_provisional net forgiven amount_** of the debt); and

      * (b) if such an agreement is made:

    * (4) Neither subsection (2) nor (3) applies in relation to an agreement unless the agreement:

      * (a) is in writing and signed by the public officer of each company; and

      * (b) is made before:

        * (ii) any later day that the Commissioner determines in writing.

    * (5) A determination made under subparagraph (4)(b)(ii) is not a legislative instrument.

##### Subdivision 245E--Application of net forgiven amounts

##### Guide to Subdivision 245E

##### 24595  What this Subdivision is about

    * The total of the net forgiven amounts of all your debts forgiven in an income year is applied to reduce 4 classes of amounts that could otherwise reduce your taxable income in the same or a later income year. It is applied in the following order:

          * (a) to your tax losses from previous income years;

          * (b) to your net capital losses from previous income years;

          * (c) to the deductions you would otherwise get in the income year, or in a later income year, because of expenditure from a previous year (for example, the capital allowance deductions you would get for expenditure on acquiring a depreciating asset);

          * (d) to the cost bases of your CGT assets.

    * You can choose the order in which the net forgiven amounts reduce the amounts within each class.

    * If all the amounts in the 4 classes are reduced to nil, any remaining net forgiven amounts are disregarded.

      * (b) apart from this Subdivision, could be deducted by you for the forgiveness income year or a later income year if no event or circumstance (other than a *recoupment of the expenditure by you in the forgiveness income year) occurred that would affect its deductibility.

          * Note: If the asset to which the expenditure relates was disposed of, lost or destroyed before 28 June 1996 or the expenditure was recouped before 28 June 1996, see section 24510 of the_ Income Tax (Transitional Provisions) Act 1997_.

      * (a) before the *forgiveness income year; and

      * (b) for the purposes of any provision of this Act that includes an amount in your assessable income or allows you a deduction:

      * (g) a CGT asset that, throughout the period before the forgiveness income year when it was owned by you, was your *trading stock;

      * (h) a CGT asset if:

        * (i) expenditure by you (of a kind which is subject to reduction under section 245145) relates to the asset; and

        * (ii) a *CGT event in relation to the asset would result in an amount being included in your assessable income, or in you being able to deduct an amount;

      * (i) if you are a foreign resident at the beginning of the forgiveness income year--an asset of yours that is not *taxable Australian property.

##### 245185  Relevant cost bases of investments in associated entities are reduced last

    * If your *CGT assets that are subject to reduction under section 245175 include investments in, or in relation to, an *associate of yours (including *membership interests, or *debt interests, in your associate), the:

      * (a) *cost base; and

      * (b) *reduced cost base;

    * of those assets are not subject to reduction under section 245175 until the *total net forgiven amount (if any) remaining has been applied, to the maximum extent possible, in reduction of the cost bases of your other CGT assets.

##### 245190  Reduction of the relevant cost bases of a CGT asset

    * (1) Subject to subsection (3), if you choose to apply an amount in reduction of the *cost base and *reduced cost base of a particular *CGT asset, the cost base and reduced cost base of the asset, as at any time on or after the beginning of the *forgiveness income year, are reduced by that amount.

    * (2) The reduction by a particular amount of the *cost base and *reduced cost base of a particular *CGT asset is, for the purpose of working out the amount by which the *total net forgiven amount remaining is applied, taken to be a reduction by the particular amount (and not by the sum of the amounts by which those cost bases are reduced).

    * (3) The maximum amount by which the *cost base and *reduced cost base of a *CGT asset may be reduced is the amount that, apart from sections 245175 to 245185, would be the reduced cost base of the asset calculated as if a *CGT event had happened to the asset:

      * (a) subject to paragraph (b), on the first day of the *forgiveness income year; or

      * (b) if, after the beginning of that income year, an event occurred that would cause the reduced cost base of the asset to be reduced--on the day on which the event occurred;

    * and the asset had been *disposed of at its *market value on the day concerned.

##### Unapplied total net forgiven amount

##### 245195  No further consequences if there is any remaining unapplied total net forgiven amount

    * Capital protection provided under a relevant capital protected borrowing to the extent that it is not provided by an explicit put option is treated (for the borrower) as if it were a put option.

    * An amount attributable to capital protection under any relevant capital protected borrowing is treated (for the borrower) as a payment for a put option.

       * 24730	Exercise or expiry of option

##### Operative provisions

##### 2475  Object of Division

    * The object of this Division is to ensure that amounts for *capital protection under all relevant *capital protected borrowings are treated (for the borrower) under this Act as a payment for a put option.

##### 24710  What capital protected borrowing and capital protection are

    * (1) An *arrangement under which a *borrowing is made, or credit is provided, is a **_capital protected borrowing_** if the borrower is wholly or partly protected against a fall in the *market value of a thing (the **_protected thing_**) to the extent that:

      * (a) the borrower uses the amount borrowed or credit provided to acquire the protected thing; or

      * (b) the borrower uses the protected thing as security for the borrowing or provision of credit.

    * (2) That protection is called **_capital protection_**.

##### 24715  Application of this Division

    * (1) This Division applies to a *capital protected borrowing only if the protected thing is a beneficial interest in:

      * (a) a *share, a unit in a unit trust or a stapled security; or

      * (b) an entity that holds a beneficial interest in a share, unit in a unit trust or stapled security either directly, or indirectly through one or more interposed entities.

    * (2) This Division applies only to borrowers under *capital protected borrowings.

    * (3) This Division does not apply to a *capital protected borrowing if:

      * (a) an *ESS interest is acquired under the borrowing; and

      * (b) Subdivision 83AB or 83AC (about employee share schemes) applies to the ESS interest.

    * (4) This Division does not apply to a *capital protected borrowing entered into before 1 July 2007 (except to the extent that it is extended on or after that day) unless the *share, unit in a unit trust or stapled security is listed for quotation in the official list of an *approved stock exchange.

    * (5) This Division does not apply to a *capital protected borrowing entered into on or after 1 July 2007 if:

      * (a) the protected thing is a beneficial interest in:

        * (i) a *share, unit or stapled security that is not listed for quotation in the official list of an *approved stock exchange; or

        * (ii) an entity that holds a beneficial interest in a share, unit in a unit trust or stapled security either directly, or indirectly through one or more interposed entities, that is not so listed; and

      * (b) one of these conditions is satisfied:

        * (i) for a nonlisted share--the company is not a *widely held company;

        * (ii) for a nonlisted unit--the trust is not a widely held unit trust as defined in section 272105 in Schedule 2F to the _Income Tax Assessment Act 1936_;

        * (iii) for a nonlisted stapled security--any company involved is not a widely held company and any trust involved is not such a widely held unit trust.

##### 24720  Treating capital protection as a put option

    * (1) This section applies to a borrower if:

      * (aa) the borrower has an excess using the method statement in subsection (3) for:

        * (i) a *capital protected borrowing entered into after 7.30 pm, by legal time in the Australian Capital Territory, on 13 May 2008 (the **_2008 Budget time_**); or

        * (ii) an extension of the capital protected borrowing; or

      * (a) the borrower has an amount that is reasonably attributable to the *capital protection as mentioned in subsection (2) for a capital protected borrowing entered into or extended on or after 1 July 2007 and at or before the 2008 Budget time; or

      * (b) the borrower has an amount that is reasonably attributable to the capital protection as mentioned in subsection (2) for a capital protected borrowing entered into or extended at or after 9.30 am, by legal time in the Australian Capital Territory, on 16 April 2003 and before 1 July 2007.

          * Note: If a capital protected borrowing covered by paragraph (1)(a) or (b) is extended or otherwise changed after the 2008 Budget time, section 24785 of the _Income Tax (Transitional Provisions) Act 1997_ applies to the capital protected borrowing.

    * (2) For paragraphs (1)(a) and (b), the amount that is reasonably attributable to the *capital protection is worked out under Division 247 of the _Income Tax (Transitional Provisions) Act 1997_.

    * (3) This is the method statement.

Method statement

        * Step 1.	Work out the total amount incurred by the borrower under or in respect of the *capital protected borrowing for the income year, ignoring amounts that are not in substance for *capital protection or interest.

        * Step 2.	Work out the total interest that would have been incurred for the income year on a *borrowing or provision of credit of the same amount as under the *capital protected borrowing at the rate applicable under either or both of subsections (4) and (5A).

        * Step 3.	If the step 1 amount exceeds the step 2 amount, the excess is reasonably attributable to the *capital protection for the income year.

          * Example: Amounts that would be ignored under step 1 include amounts that are in substance the repayment of a loan or credit, the payment of an application fee or brokerage commission and the payment of stamp duty or other tax.

    * (4) If:

      * (a) the *capital protected borrowing is at a fixed rate for all or part of the term of the capital protected borrowing; and

      * (b) that fixed rate is applicable to the capital protected borrowing for all or part of the income year;

    * use the rate worked out under subsection (5) at the first time an amount covered by step 1 of the method statement in subsection (3) was incurred, in any income year, during the term of the capital protected borrowing or that part of the term.

    * (5) The rate (the **_adjusted loan rate_**), at a particular time, is the sum of:

      * (a) the Reserve Bank of Australia's Indicator Lending Rate for Standard Variable Housing Loans at that time; and

      * (b) 100 basis points.

    * (5A) If:

      * (a) the *capital protected borrowing is at a variable rate for all or part of the term of the capital protected borrowing; and

      * (b) a variable rate is applicable to the capital protected borrowing for all or part of the income year;

    * use the average of the adjusted loan rates applicable during those parts of the income year when the capital protected borrowing is at a variable rate.

    * (6) If this section applies to a borrower, this Act applies as if:

      * (a) the borrower's excess from the method statement in subsection (3); or

      * (b) the amount that is reasonably attributable to *capital protection as mentioned in paragraph (1)(a) or (b);

    * (reduced by any amount the borrower incurred under or in respect of the *capital protected borrowing for an explicit put option) were incurred only for a put option granted by the lender or by another entity under the *arrangement.

##### 24725  Number of put options

    * (1) If a *capital protected borrowing specifies more than one occasion on which the *capital protection can be invoked, this Act applies as if there were a separate put option for each of those occasions. So much of the amount to which subsection 24720(6) applies as is reasonably attributable to each option is taken to have been incurred for that option.

    * (2) However, if a borrower may invoke the *capital protection under a *capital protected borrowing at any time up to the end of a period, or only at the end of a period, for which there is capital protection, this Act applies as if there were a single put option for that period.

##### 24730  Exercise or expiry of option

    * (1) If the *capital protection under a *capital protected borrowing is invoked:

      * (a) the borrower is taken to have exercised the put option; and

      * (b) any interest in a *share, unit in a unit trust or stapled security that is acquired by the lender or another entity under the *arrangement as a result of that capital protection being invoked is taken to have been disposed of by the borrower as a result of the exercise of the option.

    * (2) If the *capital protection under a *capital protected borrowing is not invoked on or before the last occasion on which it could have been, the put option is taken to have expired.

          * Note: If a borrower under a capital protected borrowing holds the protected things on capital account, the exercise or expiry of the put option may give rise to a capital gain or capital loss: see sections 10425 (CGT event C2) and 1341 (exercise of options).

##### Guide to Division 250

##### 2501  What this Division is about

    * This Division denies or reduces certain capital allowance deductions that would otherwise be available to you in relation to an asset if the asset is put to a tax preferred use in certain circumstances.

    * If the capital allowance deductions are denied or reduced, certain financial benefits in relation to the tax preferred use of the asset are assessed only to the extent of a notional gain component. This component is worked out on the basis of treating the arrangements under which the asset is put to a tax preferred use, and financial benefits are provided in relation to that tax preferred use, as a loan. Subdivision 250E then applies to determine the amounts that are to be assessed.

      * (b) if your capital allowance deductions are denied or reduced, to treat the *arrangement for the tax preferred use of the asset as a loan that is taxed as a financial arrangement (on a compounding accruals basis).

        * (ii) any *tax preferred entity (or a connected entity); or

        * (iii) any entity that is a foreign resident; and

      * (d) disregarding this Division, you would be entitled to a *capital allowance in relation to:

        * (i) a decline in the value of the asset; or

        * (ii) expenditure in relation to the asset; and

      * (e) you lack a *predominant economic interest in the asset at that time.

##### 25020  First exclusion--small business entities

    * This Division does not apply to you and an asset if: 

      * (a) you are a *small business entity for the income year in which the *arrangement period for the *tax preferred use of the asset starts; and

      * (b) you choose to deduct amounts under Subdivision 328D for the asset for that income year.

##### 25025  Second exclusion--financial benefits under minimum value limit

    * (1) This Division does not apply to you and an asset that is being *put to a tax preferred use under a particular *arrangement if, at the start of the *arrangement period, the total of the nominal values of all the *financial benefits that have been, or will be or can reasonably be expected to be, provided to you (or a *connected entity):

      * (a) by *members of the tax preferred sector; and

      * (b) in relation to the *tax preferred use of the asset or any other asset that is being, or is to be, put to a tax preferred use under the arrangement;

    * does not exceed $5 million.

    * (2) The amount referred to in subsection (1) is indexed annually.

          * Note: Subdivision 960M shows you how to index amounts.

##### 25030  Third exclusion--certain short term or low value arrangements

    * Certain short term or low value arrangements generally excluded

    * (1) This Division does not apply to you and an asset that is being *put to a tax preferred use under a particular *arrangement if:

      * (a) the *arrangement period for the *tax preferred use of the asset does not exceed:

        * (i) 5 years if the asset is real property and the tax preferred use of the asset is a lease; or

        * (ii) 3 years in any other case; or

      * (b) at the start of the arrangement period, the total of the nominal values of all the *financial benefits that have been, will be or can reasonably be expected to be, provided to you (or a *connected entity):

        * (i) by *members of the tax preferred sector; and

        * (ii) in relation to the tax preferred use of the asset or any other asset that is being, or is to be, put to a tax preferred use under the arrangement;

        * (ii) $20 million in any other case.

    * This subsection has effect subject to section 25035.

    * (2) The amounts referred to in paragraphs (1)(b) and (c) are indexed annually.

          * Note: Subdivision 960M shows you how to index amounts.

##### 25035  Exceptions to section 25030

    * Debt interests

    * (1) Section 25030 does not apply if the *arrangement (either alone or together with any arrangement in relation to the *tax preferred use of the asset or the provision of *financial benefits in relation to the tax preferred use of the asset) is a *debt interest.

    * (2) In applying subsection (1), disregard subsection 974130(4).

    * Member of tax preferred sector having certain rights in relation to the asset

    * (3) Section 25030 does not apply if:

      * (a) a *member of the tax preferred sector has:

        * (i) a right, obligation or contingent obligation to purchase or acquire the asset or a legal or equitable interest in the asset; or

        * (ii) a right to require the transfer of the asset or a legal or equitable interest in the asset; or

        * (iii) a residual or reversionary interest in the asset that will arise or become exercisable at or after the end of the *arrangement period; and

      * (b) the consideration for the purchase, acquisition or transfer of the right, obligation or interest is not fixed as the *market value of the asset at the time of the purchase, acquisition or transfer.

    * To avoid doubt, this subsection does not apply to the asset merely because your interest in the asset is one that ceases to exist after the passage of a particular period of time.

    * Member of tax preferred sector providing financing

    * (4) Section 25030 does not apply if a *member of the tax preferred sector provides financing, or support for financing, in relation to your interest in the asset (including by way of a loan, a guarantee, an indemnity, a security, hedging or undertaking to provide *financial benefits in the event of the termination of an *arrangement).

    * Finance leases, noncancellable operating leases, service concessions and similar arrangements

    * (5) Section 25030 does not apply if an *arrangement in relation to the *tax preferred use of the asset, or the provision of *financial benefits in relation to the tax preferred use of the asset, is or involves:

      * (a) a finance lease; or

      * (b) a noncancellable operating lease; or

      * (c) a service concession or similar arrangement;

    * that generally accepted accounting principles, as in force at the start of the *arrangement period, require to be included as an asset or a liability in your balance sheet.

    * Financial benefits irregular, not based on comparable marketbased rates or not reflecting value of tax preferred use of asset

    * (6) Section 25030 does not apply if the *financial benefits that have been, or are to be provided, to you (or a *connected entity) by *members of the tax preferred sector in relation to the *tax preferred use of the asset:

      * (a) are not provided on a regular periodic basis (and at least annually); or

      * (b) are not based on comparable marketbased rates; or

      * (c) do not reflect the value of the tax preferred use of the asset.

    * Special rules if tax preferred use is a lease or hire of the asset

    * (7) If the *tax preferred use of the asset is a lease or hire of the asset (or the use of the asset under a lease or hire arrangement), section 25030 does not apply if:

      * (a) the asset is so specialised that the *end user could not carry out one or more of its functions effectively without the asset; and

      * (b) you would be unlikely to be able to release, rehire or resell the asset to another person who is not a *member of the tax preferred end user group.

          * Note: For particular arrangements that are treated as leases, see section 25080.

    * Special rules if tax preferred use is not a lease or hire of the asset

    * (8) If the *tax preferred use of the asset is not the lease or hire of the asset (or the use of the asset under a lease or hire arrangement), section 25030 does not apply if:

      * (a) a *member of the tax preferred sector has a right, if particular circumstances occur, to manage, or to assume control over, the asset (other than temporarily for the purpose of ensuring public health or safety, protecting the environment or continuing the supply of an essential service); or

      * (b) the asset is so specialised that it is unlikely that it could effectively be put to any use other than the tax preferred use; or

      * (c) neither you (nor a *connected entity) has effective day to day control and physical possession of the asset.

          * Note: For particular arrangements that are treated as leases, see section 25080.

##### 25040  Fourth exclusion--sum of present values of financial benefits less than amount otherwise assessable

    * (1) This Division does not apply to you and an asset that is being *put to a tax preferred use under a particular *arrangement if, when that *tax preferred use of the asset starts, the Division 250 assessable amount is less than the alternative assessable amount.

    * (2) For the purposes of subsection (1), the **_Division 250 assessable amount_** is the sum of the present values of all the amounts that would be likely to be included in your assessable income under this Division in relation to the *tax preferred use of the asset if this Division applied to you and the asset.

    * (3) This is how to work out the **_alternative assessable amount_** for the purposes of subsection (1):

Method statement

        * Step 1.	Add up the present values of the amounts that would be included in your assessable income in relation to the *financial benefits *provided in relation to the tax preferred use of the asset during the *arrangement period if this Division did not apply to you and the asset.

        * Step 2.	Add up the present values of the amounts that you would be able to deduct in relation to the asset, or expenditure in relation to the asset, under Division 40 or Division 43 in relation to the *arrangement period if this Division did not apply to you and the asset.

        * Step 3.	Deduct the amount obtained in Step 2 from the amount obtained in Step 1. The result is the **_alternative assessable amount_**.

    * (4) To avoid doubt, the amounts referred to in subsections (2) and (3) are all the amounts that would be likely to be included in your assessable income, or deducted, for all the income years during the whole, or a part, of which the asset is *put to the tax preferred use.

    * (5) The point in time to be used in determining, for the purposes of this section:

      * (a) the present value of an amount that is included in your assessable income for an income year; or

      * (b) the present value of an amount that you would be able to deduct for an income year;

    * is the end of the income year.

##### 25045  Fifth exclusion--Commissioner determination

    * This Division does not apply to you and an asset at a particular time if: 

      * (a) you request the Commissioner to make a determination under this subsection; and

      * (b) the Commissioner determines that it is unreasonable that the Division should apply to you and the asset at that time, having regard to:

        * (i) the circumstances because of which this Division would apply to you and the asset; and

        * (ii) any other relevant circumstances.

##### Tax preferred use of asset

##### 25050  End user of an asset

    * (1) An entity (other than you) is an **_end user _**of an asset if the entity (or a *connected entity):

      * (a) uses, or effectively controls the use of, the asset; or

      * (b) will use, or effectively control the use of, the asset; or

      * (c) is able to use, or effectively control the use of, the asset; or

      * (d) will be able to use, or effectively control the use of, the asset.

    * (2) The control referred to in subsection (1) may be direct or indirect.

    * (3) For the purposes of subsection (1), disregard any temporary control of the asset that is for the purpose of ensuring public health or safety, protecting the environment or continuing the supply of an essential service.

    * (4) To avoid doubt, an entity is taken to be an **_end user _**of an asset if the entity (or a *connected entity) holds rights as a lessee under a lease of the asset.

          * Note: For particular arrangements that are treated as leases, see section 25080.

##### 25055  Tax preferred end user

    * An *end user of an asset is a **_tax preferred end user_** if:

      * (a) the end user (or a *connected entity) is a *tax preferred entity; or

      * (b) the end user is:

        * (i) an entity that is a foreign resident; or

        * (ii) an entity that is an Australian resident, to the extent that the entity carries on *business in a foreign country at or through a *permanent establishment of the entity in that country.

##### 25060  Tax preferred use of an asset

    * (1) An asset is **_put to a tax preferred use_** at a particular time if:

      * (a) an *end user (or a *connected entity) holds, at that time, rights as lessee under a lease of the asset; and

      * (b) either or both of the following subparagraphs is satisfied at that time:

        * (i) the asset is, or is to be, used by or on behalf of an end user who is a *tax preferred end user because of paragraph 25055(a) (tax preferred entity);

        * (ii) the asset is, or is to be, used wholly or principally outside Australia and an end user of the asset is a tax preferred end user because of paragraph 25055(b) (foreign resident or business).

    * If this subsection applies, the **_tax preferred use _**of the asset is the lease referred to in paragraph (a).

          * Note: For particular arrangements that are treated as leases, see section 25080.

    * (2) An asset is also **_put to a tax preferred use_** at a particular time if:

      * (a) at that time the asset is, or is to be, used (whether or not by you) wholly or partly in connection with:

        * (i) the production, supply, carriage, transmission or delivery of goods; or

        * (ii) the provision of services or facilities; and

      * (b) either or both of the following subparagraphs is satisfied at that time:

        * (i) some or all of the goods, services or facilities are, or are to be, produced for or supplied, carried, transmitted or delivered to or for an *end user who is a *tax preferred end user because of paragraph 25055(a) (tax preferred entity) but is not an *exempt foreign government agency;

        * (ii) the asset is, or is to be, used wholly or principally outside Australia and an end user of the asset is a tax preferred end user because of paragraph 25055(b) (foreign resident or business).

    * If this subsection applies, the **_tax preferred use_** of the asset is the production, supply, carriage, transmission, delivery or provision referred to in paragraph (a).

    * (3) To avoid doubt, the facilities referred to in subsection (2) include:

      * (a) hospital or medical facilities; or

      * (b) prison facilities; or

      * (c) educational facilities; or

      * (e) transport facilities; or

      * (f) the supply of water, gas or electricity; or

      * (g) housing or accommodation; or

      * (h) premises from which to operate a *business or other undertaking.

    * (4) If the asset is being *put to a tax preferred use:

      * (a) the **_members of the tax preferred end user group_** are:

        * (i) the *tax preferred end user; and

        * (ii) the *connected entities of the tax preferred end user; and

      * (b) the **_members of the tax preferred sector_** are:

        * (i) the tax preferred end user (and connected entities); and

        * (ii) any *tax preferred entity (or a connected entity); and

        * (iii) any entity that is a foreign resident.

##### 25065  Arrangement period for tax preferred use

    * Start of the arrangement period

    * (1) The **_arrangement period _**for a particular *tax preferred use of an asset starts when that tax preferred use of the asset starts.

    * End of the arrangement period

    * (2) Subject to subsection (3), the **_arrangement period_** for a particular *tax preferred use of an asset is taken to end on the day that is the date on which the tax preferred use of the asset may reasonably be expected, or is likely, to end.

    * (3) The **_arrangement period_** for the *tax preferred use of the asset ends when this Division ceases to apply to you and the asset if that happens before the day referred to in subsection (2).

    * (4) In determining when a particular *tax preferred use of an asset is likely to end:

      * (a) regard must be had to:

        * (i) the terms of, and any other circumstances relating to, any *arrangement dealing with that tax preferred use of the asset; and

        * (ii) the terms of, and any other circumstances relating to, any arrangement dealing with the *provision of *financial benefits in relation to that tax preferred use of the asset; and

      * (b) it must be assumed that any right that an entity has to renew or extend such an arrangement will not be exercised (unless it is reasonable to assume that the right will be exercised because of the commercial consequences for the entity (or a *connected entity) of not exercising the right).

    * Tax preferred uses of asset by entity and connected entity

    * (5) For the purposes of this section:

      * (a) the *tax preferred use of an asset by an entity; and

      * (b) the tax preferred use of the asset by a *connected entity of that entity;

    * are taken to constitute a single tax preferred use of the asset.

##### 25070  New tax preferred use at end of arrangement period if tax preferred use continues

    * If: 

      * (a) this Division applies to you and an asset because the asset is *put to a tax preferred use; and

      * (b) the *arrangement period for the *tax preferred use of the asset ends on a particular date (the **_termination date_**); and

      * (c) the asset continues to be put to the tax preferred use after the termination date;

    * the tax preferred use of the asset after the termination date is taken to be a separate and distinct tax preferred use of the asset from the tax preferred use of the asset before the termination date.

          * Note: This means, among other things, that there is a new arrangement period for the tax preferred use after the termination date and that the arrangement is retested under section 25015 against circumstances as they stand immediately after the termination date.

##### 25075  What constitutes a separate asset for the purposes of this Division

    * (1) This Division applies to:

      * (a) an improvement to land; or

      * (b) a fixture on land;

    * whether the improvement or fixture is removable or not, as if it were an asset separate from the land.

    * (2) Whether a particular composite item is itself an asset or whether its components are separate assets is a question of fact and degree which can only be determined in the light of all the circumstances of the particular case.

          * Example 1: A car is made up of many separate components, but usually the car is an asset rather than each component.

          * Example 2: A floating restaurant consists of many separate components (like the ship itself, stoves, fridges, furniture, crockery and cutlery), but usually these components are treated as separate assets.

    * (3) This Division applies to a renewal or extension of an asset that is a right as if the renewal or extension were a continuation of the original right.

    * (4) This Division applies to an asset (the **_underlying asset_**) in which:

      * (a) you have an interest; and

      * (b) one or more other entities also have an interest;

    * as if your interest in the underlying asset were itself the underlying asset.

##### 25080  Treatment of particular arrangements in the same way as leases

    * This Division applies to an *arrangement that:

      * (a) in substance or effect, depends on the use of a specific asset that is:

        * (i) real property; or

        * (ii) goods or a personal chattel (other than money or a money equivalent); and

      * (b) gives a right to control the use of the asset (other than temporarily for the purpose of ensuring public health or safety, protecting the environment or continuing the supply of an essential service); and

      * (c) is not a lease;

    * in the same way as it applies to a lease.

          * Note: Even if this section applies to treat an arrangement in relation to an asset as a lease, the requirements in section 25050 still need to be satisfied before an entity can be an end user of the asset.

##### Financial benefits in relation to tax preferred use

##### 25085  Financial benefits in relation to tax preferred use of an asset

    * (1) For the purposes of this Division, the *financial benefits **_provided in relation to a tax preferred use of an asset_** include (but are not limited to):

      * (a) a financial benefit provided in relation to:

        * (i) bringing the asset into a state, condition or location in which it can be *put to the tax preferred use; or

        * (ii) the start of the *tax preferred use of the asset; and

      * (b) a financial benefit provided in relation to the end of the tax preferred use of the asset; and

      * (c) a financial benefit provided in relation to the termination or expiration of an *arrangement that deals with:

        * (i) the tax preferred use of the asset; or

        * (ii) the provision of financial benefits in relation to the tax preferred use of the asset; and

      * (d) a financial benefit provided in relation to the purchase or acquisition of the asset by, or transfer of the asset to, the *tax preferred end user (or a *connected entity).

    * (2) Without limiting paragraph (1)(b), if the asset has a *guaranteed residual value:

      * (a) the amount of the guaranteed residual value is taken to be a *financial benefit **_provided in relation to the tax preferred use of the asset_**; and

      * (b) that financial benefit is taken to be provided when the relevant payment is made in relation to the guaranteed residual value.

    * (3) The asset has a **_guaranteed residual value_** if there is an *arrangement that provides to the effect that if:

      * (a) on or after the end of the *arrangement period, you (or a *connected entity) sell or otherwise dispose of the asset to any person; and

      * (b) you (or a connected entity) receives in respect of the sale or disposal:

        * (i) no consideration; or

        * (ii) consideration that is less than an amount (the **_guaranteed amount_**) specified in, or ascertainable under, the provision;

    * a *member of the tax preferred sector will pay to you (or a connected entity), or to someone else for your benefit (or for the benefit of a connected entity), an amount equal to:

      * (c) the guaranteed amount if subparagraph (b)(i) applies; or

      * (d) the amount by which the guaranteed amount exceeds the consideration if subparagraph (b)(ii) applies.

    * The amount of the guaranteed residual value is taken to be the guaranteed amount.

    * (4) If:

      * (a) an asset is *put to a tax preferred use; and

      * (b) an entity is an *end user of the asset because the entity manages the asset or the use to which the asset is put;

    * any *financial benefit that the entity (or a *connected entity) provides that is calculated by reference to the receipts, revenue or income generated by the use of the asset is also taken to be a financial benefit **_provided in relation to the tax preferred use of the asset_**.

    * (5) For the purposes of this Division (other than this subsection), a *financial benefit provided by a *member of the tax preferred sector is taken not to be **_provided in relation to the tax preferred use of an asset _**to the extent to which the financial benefit merely passes on, or represents:

      * (a) financial benefits provided in relation to the use of the asset; or

      * (b) something derived from the use of the asset;

    * by someone who is not a member of the tax preferred sector.

    * (6) For the purposes of this Division, disregard a *financial benefit *provided in relation to the tax preferred use of the asset to the extent to which it consists solely of routine maintenance of the asset.

    * (7) For the purposes of this Division, if a *financial benefit is provided in relation to the use of a number of assets, a separate financial benefit of an amount or value that is reasonably attributable to each asset is taken to be provided in relation to each asset.

    * (8) To avoid doubt, a *financial benefit may be **_provided in relation to a tax preferred use of an asset _**even though it is provided before the *tax preferred use of the asset starts.

    * (9) For the purposes of this Division:

      * (a) a *financial benefit that is not an amount:

        * (i) is taken to become due and payable when the entity providing the financial benefit becomes liable to provide the financial benefit; and

        * (ii) is taken to be paid when it is provided; and

      * (b) a financial benefit that is paid without becoming due and payable is taken to have become due and payable on the day on which it was paid.

##### 25090  Financial benefit provided directly or indirectly

    * For the purposes of this Division, a person (the **_provider_**) is taken to provide a *financial benefit to a person (the **_recipient_**) in relation to a *tax preferred use of an asset whether the financial benefit is provided to the recipient:

      * (a) directly; or

      * (b) indirectly (including indirectly through an entity that is not a *connected entity of the recipient and is not a connected entity of the provider).

##### 25095  Expected financial benefits in relation to an asset put to tax preferred use

    * For the purposes this Division, the **_expected financial benefits _**at a particular time in relation to an asset that is *put to a tax preferred use are the *financial benefits that, at that time:

      * (a) have been; or

      * (b) will, assuming normal operating conditions, be; or

      * (c) can, assuming normal operating conditions, reasonably be expected to be;

    * *provided in relation to the tax preferred use of the asset by a *member of the tax preferred sector to someone who is not a member of the tax preferred sector.

          * Note: Paragraphs 25085(1)(b), (c) and (d) provide for certain benefits provided in relation to the end of the tax preferred use of the asset or in relation to the purchase, disposal or transfer of the asset to be treated as financial benefits provided in relation to the tax preferred use of the asset.

##### 250100  Present value of financial benefit that has already been provided

    * For the purposes of this Division, the **_present value_** of a *financial benefit at a particular time is the nominal amount or value of the financial benefit if the financial benefit has been provided before that time.

##### Discount rate to be used in working out present values

##### 250105  Discount rate to be used in working out present values

    * (1) For the purposes of section 25040, the discount rate to be used in working out the present value of a future amount is the *long term bond rate for the *financial year in which the relevant *arrangement period starts.

    * (2) For the purposes of section 250135 and Subdivisions 250C and 250D, the discount rate to be used in working out the present value of a future amount is a rate that reflects a constant periodic rate of return (worked out on a compounding basis) on the investment in:

      * (a) the asset referred to in subparagraph 25015(d)(i) if that subparagraph applies; or

      * (b) the expenditure referred to in paragraph 25015(d)(ii) if that subparagraph applies;

    * that is implicit in the *arrangements under which the asset is *put to a tax preferred use and *financial benefits are *provided in relation to that tax preferred use.

##### Predominant economic interest

##### 250110  Predominant economic interest

    * You lack a **_predominant economic interest_** in an asset at a particular time only if one or more of the following sections apply to you and the asset at that time:

      * (a) section 250115 (limited recourse debt test);

      * (b) section 250120 (right to acquire asset test);

      * (c) section 250125 (effectively noncancellable, long term arrangement test);

      * (d) section 250135 (level of expected financial benefits test).

##### 250115  Limited recourse debt test

    * (1) You lack a **_predominant economic interest_** in an asset at a particular time if more than the allowable percentage of the cost of your acquiring or constructing the asset is financed (directly or indirectly) by a *limited recourse debt or debts.

    * (2) For the purposes of subsection (1):

      * (a) the amount of a *limited recourse debt is to be reduced by the value of any * debt property (other than the *financed property) that is provided as security for the debt; and

      * (b) if the limited recourse debt finances the acquisition or construction of 2 or more assets, only the amount of the debt that is reasonably attributable to the asset referred to in subsection (1) is to be taken into account.

    * (3) For the purposes of subsection (1), the allowable percentage is:

      * (a) 80% if the asset is taken to be *put to a tax preferred use because of subparagraph 25060(1)(b)(i) or (2)(b)(i) (end use by *tax preferred entities); or

      * (b) 55% if the asset is taken to be put to a tax preferred use because of subparagraph 25060(1)(b)(ii) or (2)(b)(ii) (end use by foreign residents or businesses).

    * (4) This section does not apply to the asset if:

      * (a) you are a *corporate tax entity; and

      * (b) the *tax preferred use of the asset is not the lease or hire of the asset (and is not the use of the asset under a lease or hire arrangement); and

      * (c) the asset is *put to the tax preferred use wholly or principally in Australia; and

      * (d) no *member of the tax preferred sector provides financing, or support for financing, in relation to your interest in the asset (including by way of a loan, a guarantee, an indemnity, a security, hedging or undertaking to provide *financial benefits in the event of the termination of an *arrangement).

    * (5) Paragraph (4)(b) does not apply if:

      * (a) the asset is real property (or an interest in real property); and

      * (b) the *tax preferred use of the asset is a lease; and

      * (c) the space within the property that is occupied by tenants who are *members of the tax preferred sector is less than half of the total space within the property that is either occupied by tenants or available to be occupied by tenants.

    * (6) This section also does not apply to the asset if:

      * (a) you hold the asset as a trustee; and

      * (b) the asset is real property (or an interest in real property); and

      * (c) the *tax preferred use of the asset is a lease; and

      * (d) the space within the property that is occupied by tenants who are *members of the tax preferred sector is less than half of the total space within the property that is either occupied by tenants or available to be occupied by tenants; and

      * (e) the asset is *put to the tax preferred use wholly or principally in Australia; and

      * (f) no member of the tax preferred sector provides financing, or support for financing, in relation to your interest in the asset (including by way of a loan, a guarantee, an indemnity, a security, hedging or undertaking to provide *financial benefits in the event of the termination of an *arrangement).

##### 250120  Right to acquire asset test

    * (1) You lack a **_predominant economic interest_** in an asset at a particular time if, at that time:

      * (a) the asset is to be transferred to a *member of the tax preferred sector after the end of the *arrangement period; and

      * (b) the consideration for the transfer is not fixed as the *market value of the asset at the time of the transfer.

    * (2) You also lack a **_predominant economic interest_** in an asset at a particular time if, at that time:

      * (a) a *member of the tax preferred end user group has, or will have:

        * (i) a right, obligation or contingent obligation to purchase or acquire the asset or a legal or equitable interest in the asset; or

        * (ii) a right to require the transfer of the asset or a legal or equitable interest in the asset; and

      * (b) the consideration for the purchase, acquisition or transfer is not fixed as the *market value of the asset at the time of the purchase, acquisition or transfer.

    * To avoid doubt, this section does not apply to the asset merely because your interest in the asset is one that ceases to exist after the passage of a particular period of time.

##### 250125  Effectively noncancellable, long term arrangement test

    * (1) You lack a **_predominant economic interest_** in an asset at a particular time if:

      * (a) any *arrangement that relates to:

        * (i) the *tax preferred use of the asset; or

        * (ii) the *financial benefits to be *provided by the *members of the tax preferred sector in relation to the tax preferred use of the asset;

      * is *effectively noncancellable (see section 250130); and

      * (b) the *arrangement period for the tax preferred use of the asset is:

        * (i) greater than 30 years; or

        * (ii) if the arrangement period is less than or equal to 30 years--75% or more of that part of the asset's *effective life that remains when the tax preferred use of the asset starts.

    * (2) Disregard section 40102 in working out the asset's *effective life for the purposes of subparagraph (1)(b)(ii).

##### 250130  Meaning of effectively noncancellable arrangement

    * (1) An *arrangement that relates to *financial benefits to be *provided by a *member of the tax preferred sector in relation to the tax preferred use of an asset is **_effectively noncancellable_** if:

      * (a) the arrangement can be cancelled only with:

        * (i) your permission; or

        * (ii) the permission of a *connected entity of yours; or

        * (iii) an agent or entity acting on your behalf (or on behalf of a connected entity of yours); or

      * (b) the arrangement can be cancelled without the permission of an entity referred to in paragraph (a) but, if the arrangement were cancelled, the member of the tax preferred sector or another member of the tax preferred sector:

        * (i) would be required to enter into a new arrangement for the *provision of financial benefits in relation to the tax preferred use of the asset; or

        * (ii) would incur a penalty and the magnitude of the penalty would be such as to discourage cancellation.

    * (2) For these purposes, if a *member of the tax preferred sector defaults under an *arrangement and the arrangement is cancelled, the arrangement is to be taken to have been cancelled without the permission of an entity referred to in paragraph (1)(a).

##### 250135  Level of expected financial benefits test

    * Effective guarantee or indemnity for value of asset

    * (1) You lack a **_predominant economic interest_** in an asset at a particular time if the asset has a *guaranteed residual value at that time.

    * Likely financial benefits exceeding 70% limit

    * (2) You also lack a **_predominant economic interest_** in an asset at a particular time if, at that time:

      * (a) the *arrangement under which the asset is *put to the tax preferred use (either alone or together with any other arrangement in relation to the *tax preferred use of the asset or the *provision of *financial benefits in relation to the tax preferred use of the asset) is a *debt interest; or

      * (b) the sum of the present values of the *expected financial benefits that *members of the tax preferred sector have provided, or are or are reasonably likely to provide, to you (or a *connected entity) in relation to the tax preferred use of the asset exceeds 70% of:

        * (i) the *market value of the asset if subparagraph 25015(d)(i) applies; or

        * (ii) so much of the market value of the asset as is attributable to the expenditure referred to subparagraph 25015(d)(ii) if that subparagraph applies.

##### 250140  When to retest predominant economic interest under section 250135

    * Purpose for applying section

    * (1) This section applies for the purposes of working out whether this Division applies to you and to an asset that is *put to a tax preferred use.

    * No need to keep retesting if section 250135 does not apply at start of tax preferred use of asset

    * (2) If section 250135 does not apply to you and the asset at the time when the *tax preferred use of the asset starts, that section is taken, subject to subsection (4), to continue not to apply to you and the asset.

          * Note: This subsection means that if section 250135 does not apply to the arrangement when the tax preferred use of the asset starts, the arrangement does not need to be retested against section 250135 until a change of the kind referred to in subsection (4) occurs.

    * No need to keep retesting if section 250135 does not apply when you do something to increase value of expected financial benefits

    * (3) If:

      * (a) you (or a *connected entity), or a *member of the tax preferred sector, do something, or omit to do something, at a particular time that increases the value of the *expected financial benefits in relation to the *tax preferred use of the asset; and

      * (b) section 250135 does not apply to the asset at that time;

    * that section is taken, subject to subsection (4), to continue not to apply to you and the asset.

          * Note: This subsection means that if the arrangement is retested against section 250135 at a particular time and section 250135 does not apply to the arrangement on that retesting, the arrangement does not need to be again retested against section 250135 until a change of the kind referred to in subsection (4) occurs.

    * Retesting when you do something to increase the value of expected financial benefits

    * (4) Subsection (2) or (3) ceases to apply to you and the asset if you (or a *connected entity), or a *member of the tax preferred sector, do something, or omit to do something, that increases the value of the *expected financial benefits in relation to the *tax preferred use of the asset.

    * Certain financial benefits ignored when retesting

    * (5) For the purposes of reapplying section 250135 to the asset, disregard *financial benefits provided before subsection (2) or (3) of this section ceased to apply to the asset.

          * Note: If:

           * (a) subsection (2) or (3) ceases to apply to the asset at a particular time under this subsection; and

           * (b) the asset is retested at that time against section 250135; and

           * (c) on the retesting, that section is found to apply to the asset at that time;

          * subsection (3) will start to apply to the asset again from that time because paragraph (3)(b) will have been satisfied.

    * Clarification that retesting only required if you do something to increase value of expected benefits

    * (6) To avoid doubt, subsection (2) or (3) does not cease to apply merely because the value of the *expected financial benefits in relation to the asset increase because of something other than action taken, or an omission made, by you (or a *connected entity) or a *member of the tax preferred sector.

          * Note: This subsection means that retesting under subsection (4) is not triggered by an increase in the value of expected financial benefits that happens because of external circumstances (circumstances external to activities and omissions of yours, your connected entities and members of the tax preferred sector).

       * 250150	Apportionment rule

##### 250145  Denial of capital allowance deductions

    * (1) If this Division applies to you and an asset at a particular time, any condition that needs to be satisfied for you to be able to deduct an amount under a *capital allowance provision in relation to:

      * (a) a decline in the value of the asset; or

      * (b) expenditure in relation to the asset;

    * is taken not to be satisfied at that time.

    * (2) This section has effect subject to section 250150.

##### 250150  Apportionment rule

    * (1) This section applies if:

      * (a) this Division applies to you and an asset that is *put to a tax preferred use; and

      * (b) it is reasonable to expect that, during the *arrangement period for the *tax preferred use of the asset, particular *financial benefits will be provided to you (or a *connected entity); and

      * (c) it is reasonable to expect that those financial benefits:

        * (i) will be provided in relation to a use of the asset that is not that tax preferred use and is not a private use; or

        * (ii) will be *provided in relation to that tax preferred use of the asset but will not be attributable, directly or indirectly, to financial benefits that are provided by *members of the tax preferred sector; and

      * (d) the amount or value of those financial benefits is known or can reasonably be estimated; and

      * (e) you choose to have this section apply to the asset.

    * In applying paragraph (c), disregard financial benefits that are provided under an *arrangement that is a *debt interest.

    * (2) A choice under paragraph (1)(e) in relation to an asset:

      * (a) must be made before the due date for you to lodge your *income tax return for the income year in which the *arrangement period for the *tax preferred use of the asset starts; and

      * (b) must be made for the whole of the arrangement period for the tax preferred use of the asset; and

      * (c) must extend to all assets that are, or are to be, *put to a tax preferred use under the *arrangement under which the asset is put to that use; and

      * (d) is irrevocable.

    * The choice may extend to an asset referred to in paragraph (c) even if it is likely that paragraphs (1)(b) and (c) will not apply to that asset.

    * (3) If this section applies, section 250145 applies to you and the asset only to the extent of the *disallowed capital allowance percentage.

    * (4) Subject to subsection (6), the **_disallowed capital allowance percentage_** is the following ratio (expressed as a percentage):

    * (5) The Commissioner may, before the due date for you to lodge your *income tax return for the income year to which the *arrangement period for the *tax preferred use of the asset starts, approve an alternative method for working out the *disallowed capital allowance percentage for you and the asset.

    * (6) If the Commissioner approves an alternative method under subsection (5), the **_disallowed capital allowance percentage_** is the percentage worked out in accordance with that alternative method.

##### 250155  Arrangement treated as loan

    * Loan with characteristics provided for in this section taken to exist

    * (1) If this Division applies to you and an asset at a particular time in an income year, a *financial arrangement in the form of a loan (with the characteristics provided for in this section) is taken to exist at that time for the purposes of working out your taxable income for that income year.

          * Note: See Subdivision 250E for the taxation treatment of the financial arrangement.

    * Lender

    * (2) You are taken to be the lender in relation to the loan.

    * Amount lent and unpaid at the start of the arrangement period

    * (3) The amount worked out under subsection (4) is taken to be the amount that you have lent, and that the borrower has not repaid, at the start of the *arrangement period.

    * (4) The amount is worked out by taking:

      * (a) the amount that, at the start of the *arrangement period, is:

        * (i) the *adjustable value of the asset if subparagraph 25015(d)(i) applies; or

        * (ii) the amount worked out under subsection (5) if subparagraph 25015(d)(ii) applies; or

      * (b) if section 250150 applies--the amount that, at the start of the arrangement period, is the *disallowed capital allowance percentage of:

        * (i) the adjustable value of the asset if subparagraph 25015(d)(i) applies; or

        * (ii) the amount worked out under subsection (5) if subparagraph 25015(d)(ii) applies;

    * and deducting the sum of all *financial benefits that are *subject to deemed loan treatment and that have become due and payable before the start of the arrangement period.

    * (5) If subparagraph 25015(d)(ii) applies, the amount worked out under this subsection for the purposes of subsection (4) is:

    * Amounts paid to you by borrower under the loan

    * (6) Any *financial benefit that:

      * (a) a person provides; and

      * (b) is *subject to deemed loan treatment;

    * is taken to be an amount that the borrower pays you under the loan.

          * Note 1: Section 250160 tells you which financial benefits are subject to the deemed loan treatment.

          * Note 2: These benefits may be ones that are provided either to you or to a connected entity.

    * Period of the loan

    * (7) The *arrangement period is taken to be the period of the loan.

    * Applying Subdivision 250E to the loan

    * (8) For the purposes of applying Subdivision 250E to the loan:

      * (a) you are taken to have an overall gain from the loan and that overall gain is taken to be sufficiently certain at the time when you start to have the loan; and

      * (b) the amount of that overall gain is taken to be the sum of the *financial benefits that are *subject to the deemed loan treatment less the amount worked out under subsection (4); and

      * (c) you are taken:

        * (i) to start to have the loan at the start of the *arrangement period; and

        * (ii) to cease to have the loan at the end of the arrangement period; and

      * (d) any right that you (or a connected entity) have to a financial benefit that is subject to deemed loan treatment is taken to be a right that you have under the loan; and

      * (e) if a *connected entity transfers to another person a right to a financial benefit subject to deemed loan treatment:

        * (i) you are taken to transfer the right to that other person; and

        * (ii) any consideration that the connected entity receives in relation to the transfer is taken to be consideration that you receive in relation to the transfer; and

      * (f) if a right that a connected entity has to a financial benefit subject to deemed loan treatment ceases and the connected entity receives consideration in relation to that cessation--you are taken to receive that consideration in relation to the cessation; and

      * (g) you are taken to start to have the loan, or to cease to have the loan, as consideration for something if you start to have the rights to the financial benefits that are subject to deemed loan treatment, or cease to have those rights, as consideration for that thing; and

      * (h) in applying sections 250265 to 250275:

        * (i) the amount that you are taken, under subsections (3), (4) and (5), to have lent are the only financial benefits that you provide under the loan; and

        * (ii) the financial benefits you have received under the loan are taken to include financial benefits that are subject to deemed loan treatment that a person is, at the end of the arrangement period, liable to provide to you.

    * (9) If, under subsection 250160(2), a particular percentage of a reasonable estimate of the *end value of the asset was taken to be a *financial benefit that is *subject to the deemed loan treatment, subsection 250275(1) applies to the loan at the end of the *arrangement period as if you had received under the loan a financial benefit equal to the relevant percentage of the end value of the asset.

##### 250160  Financial benefits that are subject to deemed loan treatment

    * General rule

    * (1) Subject to subsections (3) and (4), a *financial benefit is **_subject to deemed loan treatment_** if:

      * (a) the financial benefit:

        * (i) has been; or

        * (ii) will, assuming normal operating conditions, be; or

        * (iii) can, assuming normal operating conditions, reasonably be expected to be;

      * provided to you (or a *connected entity); and

      * (b) the financial benefit has been, will be or can reasonably be expected to be *provided directly or indirectly by a *member of the tax preferred sector in relation to the *tax preferred use of the asset; and

      * (c) the right to receive, or the obligation to provide, the financial benefit is *cash settlable; and

      * (d) the financial benefit has not been, will not be or can be expected not to be provided by one of your connected entities.

          * Note: Paragraph (d) stops a financial benefit passing between you and any of your connected entities from being counted twice.

    * End value also taken to be financial benefit subject to deemed loan treatment

    * (2) The relevant percentage of a reasonable estimate of the *end value of the asset is also taken to be a *financial benefit that is **_subject to deemed loan treatment_** if:

      * (a) the asset is not to be purchased or acquired by, or transferred to, a *member of the tax preferred sector at the end of the *arrangement period under a legally enforceable *arrangement; or

      * (b) the asset:

        * (i) is, or is to become, a *privatised asset; or

        * (ii) would be, or would become, a privatised asset if it were a *depreciating asset; or

        * (iii) would be a privatised asset if the asset were a depreciating asset and paragraphs 585(2)(a) and 585(4)(a) were not limited to acquisitions of depreciating assets that occurred on or after 1 July 2001.

    * The relevant percentage is the *disallowed capital allowance percentage if section 250150 applies. Otherwise it is 100%.

          * Note: See section 250180 for how to work out the end value of the asset.

    * Financial benefits only subject to deemed loan treatment to the extent to which they represent a return on investment

    * (3) The *financial benefit is **_subject to deemed loan treatment_** only to the extent to which it reasonably represents a return of, or on, an investment in the asset (as distinct, for example, from representing consideration for the provision of services or the recovery of production costs), having regard to:

      * (a) the *market value of the asset; and

      * (b) the discount rate applicable under subsection 250105(2); and

      * (c) your costs in relation to funding your interest in the asset; and

      * (d) any other relevant matter.

    * The regulations may provide rules to be applied in determining the extent to which a financial benefit reasonably represents a return of or on an investment in the asset.

    * Only financial benefits provided after Division starts applying to you and the asset

    * (4) If the *tax preferred use of the asset starts before this Division starts applying to you and the asset, only *financial benefits provided after this Division starts applying to you and the asset are **_subject to deemed loan treatment_**.

##### 250180  End value of asset

    * (1) The **_end value_** of an asset is worked out in accordance with this section.

    * (2) If the asset has a *guaranteed residual value, the **_end value_** of the asset is:

      * (a) the amount of the guaranteed residual amount if subparagraph 25015(d)(i) applies; or

      * (b) so much of the amount referred to in paragraph (a) as is attributable to the expenditure referred to in subparagraph 25015(d)(ii) if that subparagraph applies.

    * (3) If the asset does not have a *guaranteed residual value and is a *depreciating asset, the **_end value_** of the asset is:

      * (a) if subparagraph 25015(d)(i) applies--the amount that would have been the *adjustable value of the asset at the end of the *arrangement period if:

        * (i) this Division had not applied to you and the asset; and

        * (ii) the decline in the asset's value were worked out on the basis of the asset's *effective life and using the *prime cost method; or

      * (b) if subparagraph 25015(d)(ii) applies--so much of the amount referred to in paragraph (a) as is attributable to the expenditure referred to in that subparagraph.

    * (4) Disregard section 40102 in working out the asset's *effective life for the purposes of subparagraph (3)(a)(ii).

    * (5) If neither subsection (2) nor subsection (3) applies and an estimate of the value of the asset is recognised for accounting purposes, the **_end value_** of the asset is:

      * (a) the value of the relevant asset at the end of the *arrangement period that would be recognised for accounting purposes if subparagraph 25015(d)(i) applies; or

      * (b) so much of the value of referred to in paragraph (a) as is attributable to the expenditure referred to subparagraph 25015(d)(ii) if that subparagraph applies.

    * The **_end value_** must not, however, exceed the amount worked out under subsections 250155(4) and (5) (amount taken to have been lent).

    * (6) If none of subsections (2), (3) and (5) apply to the asset, the **_end value_** of the asset is:

      * (a) a reasonable estimate of the *market value of the asset at the end of the *arrangement period if subparagraph 25015(d)(i) applies; or

      * (b) so much of the estimate referred to in paragraph (a) as is attributable to the expenditure referred to in subparagraph 25015(d)(ii) if that subparagraph applies.

    * The **_end value_** must not, however, exceed the amount worked out under subsections 250155(4) and (5) (amount taken to have been lent).

##### 250185  Financial benefits subject to deemed loan treatment not assessed

    * A *financial benefit is not included in your assessable income if the financial benefit:

      * (a) is *provided to you in relation to the tax preferred use of the asset; and

      * (b) is provided directly or indirectly by a *member of the tax preferred sector; and

      * (c) is *subject to deemed loan treatment.

    * The financial benefit is not assessable income and is not *exempt income.

##### Guide to Subdivision 250E

##### 250190  What this Subdivision is about

    * This Subdivision is about the tax treatment of gains and losses from the financial arrangement that you are taken to have under section 250155.

    * You recognise gains and losses from the financial arrangement, as appropriate, over the life of the financial arrangement and ignore distinctions between income and capital. You use a compounding accruals method to recognise the gain or loss.

    * A change in circumstances may cause a reestimation of gains and losses that the accruals method is being applied to.

    * A balancing adjustment is made if you transfer particular rights or obligations or particular rights or obligations cease.

##### Application and objects of Subdivision

##### 250195  Application of Subdivision

    * This Subdivision applies for the purposes of working out the amount of the gain or loss that is to be included in your assessable income or allowed as a deduction in relation to the *financial arrangement that is taken to exist under section 250155.

##### 250200  Objects of this Subdivision

    * The objects of this Subdivision are: 

      * (a) to properly recognise gains and losses from the *financial arrangement by allocating them to appropriate periods of time; and

      * (b) to minimise tax deferral.

##### Tax treatment of gains and losses from financial arrangements

##### 250205  Gains are assessable and losses deductible

    * Gains

    * (1) Your assessable income includes a gain you make from the *financial arrangement.

    * Losses

    * (2) You can deduct a loss you make from the *financial arrangement, but only to the extent that:

      * (a) you make it in gaining or producing your assessable income; or

      * (b) you necessarily make it in carrying on a *business for the purpose of gaining or producing your assessable income.

##### 250210  Gain or loss to be taken into account only once under this Act

    * Purpose of this section

    * (1) The purpose of this section is to ensure that your gains that are assessable under this Subdivision, and your losses that are deductible under this Subdivision, are taken into account only once under this Act in working out your taxable income.

    * Gain or loss

    * (2) If a gain or loss is, or is to be, included in your assessable income or allowable as a deduction to you for an income year under this Subdivision, the gain or loss is not to be (to any extent):

      * (a) included in your assessable income; or

      * (b) allowable as a deduction to you;

    * under any other provisions of this Act for the same or any other income year.

    * Associated financial benefits

    * (3) If the amount or value of a *financial benefit is taken into account in working out whether you make, or the amount of, a gain or loss that is, or is to be, included in your assessable income or allowable as a deduction for you for an income year under this Subdivision, the benefit is not to be (to any extent):

      * (a) included in your assessable income; or

      * (b) allowable as a deduction to you;

    * under any other provision of this Act for the same or any other income year.

##### Method to be applied to take account of gain or loss

##### 250215  Methods for taking gain or loss into account

    * The methods that can be applied to take account of a gain or loss you make from the *financial arrangement you have are:

      * (a) the accruals method provided for in sections 250235 to 250255; or

      * (b) a balancing adjustment provided for in sections 250265 to 250275.

    * A gain or loss is not taken into account under the method referred to in paragraph (a) to the extent to which the gain or loss is taken into account under sections 250265 to 250275.

##### General rules

##### 250220  Consistency in working out gains or losses (integrity measure)

    * Object of section

    * (1) The object of this section is to stop you obtaining an inappropriate tax benefit from not working out your gains and losses in a consistent manner.

    * Consistent treatment for particular financial arrangement

    * (2) If:

      * (a) this Subdivision provides that a particular method applies to gains or losses you make from the *financial arrangement; and

      * (b) that method allows you to choose the particular manner in which you apply that method;

    * you must use that manner consistently for the arrangement for all income years.

    * Consistent treatment for financial arrangements of essentially the same nature

    * (3) If:

      * (a) this Subdivision provides that a particular method applies to gains or losses you make from 2 or more *financial arrangements; and

      * (b) that method allows you to choose the particular manner in which you apply that method;

    * you must use that same manner consistently for all of those financial arrangements that are essentially of the same nature.

##### 250225  Rights and obligations include contingent rights and obligations

    * To avoid doubt: 

      * (a) a right is treated as a right for the purposes of this Division even it is subject to a contingency; and

      * (b) an obligation is treated as an obligation for the purpose of this Division even if it is subject to a contingency.

##### The accruals method

##### 250230  Application of accruals method

    * The accruals method provided for in sections 250235 to 250255 applies to a gain or loss you make from the *financial arrangement if:

      * (a) the gain or loss is an overall gain or loss from the arrangement; and

      * (b) the gain or loss is sufficiently certain at the time when you start to have the arrangement.

##### 250235  Overview of the accruals method

    * If the accruals method applies to a gain or loss you make from the *financial arrangement:

      * (a) you use section 250240 to work out the period over which the gain or loss is to be spread; and

      * (b) you use section 250245 to work out how to allocate the gain or loss to particular intervals within the period over which the gain or loss is to be spread; and

      * (c) if an interval to which part of the gain or loss is allocated straddles 2 income years, you use section 250250 to work out how to allocate that part of the gain or loss allocated between those 2 income years.

##### 250240  Applying accruals method to work out period over which gain or loss is to be spread

    * If you have a sufficiently certain overall gain or loss from the *financial arrangement, the period over which the gain or loss is to be spread is the period that:

      * (a) starts when you start to have the arrangement; and

      * (b) ends when you will cease to have the arrangement.

    * In applying paragraph (b), you must assume that you will continue to have the arrangement for the rest of its life.

##### 250245  How gain or loss is spread

    * How to spread gain or loss

    * (1) This section tells you how to spread a gain or loss to which the accruals method applies.

    * Compounding accruals or approximation

    * (2) The gain or loss is to be spread using:

      * (a) compounding accruals (with the intervals to which parts of the gain or loss are allocated complying with subsection (3)); or

      * (b) a method whose results approximate those obtained using the method referred to in paragraph (a) (having regard to the length of the period over which the gain or loss is to be spread).

    * Intervals to which parts of gain or loss allocated

    * (3) The intervals to which parts of the gain or loss are allocated must:

      * (a) not exceed 12 months; and

      * (b) all be of the same length.

    * Paragraph (b) does not apply to the first and last intervals. These may be shorter than the other intervals.

    * Assumption of continuing hold arrangement for the rest of its life

    * (4) The gain or loss is to be spread assuming that you will continue to have the *financial arrangement for the rest of its life.

##### 250250  Allocating gain or loss to income years

    * (1) You are taken, for the purposes of section 250205, to make, for an income year, a gain or loss equal to a part of a gain or loss if:

      * (a) that part of the gain or loss is allocated to an interval under section 250245; and

      * (b) that interval falls wholly within that income year.

    * (2) If:

      * (a) a part of a gain or loss is allocated to an interval under section 250245; and

      * (b) that interval straddles 2 income years;

    * you are taken, for purposes of section 250205, to make a gain or loss equal to so much of that part of the gain or loss as is allocated between those income years on a reasonable basis.

    * (3) If:

      * (a) a *consolidated group or *MEC group has a *financial arrangement; and

      * (b) a subsidiary member of the group ceases to be a member of the group at a particular time (the **_exit time_**); and

      * (c) immediately after the exit time, the subsidiary member has the financial arrangement;

    * an income year of the group is taken, for the purposes of applying this section to the group and the financial arrangement, to end at the exit time.

##### 250255  When to reestimate

    * When reestimation necessary

    * (1) You reestimate a gain or loss from the *financial arrangement under subsection (4) if circumstances arise that materially affect:

      * (a) the amount or value; or

      * (b) the timing;

    * of *financial benefits that were taken into account in working out the amount of the gain or loss. You must reestimate the gain or loss as soon as reasonably practicable after you become aware of the circumstances referred to in paragraph (b).

    * (2) Without limiting subsection (1), the following are circumstances of the kind referred to in paragraph (1)(b):

      * (a) a material change in market conditions that are relevant to the amount or value of the *financial benefits to be received or provided under the *financial arrangement;

      * (b) cash flows that were previously estimated becoming known and the difference between the cash flows that become known and the cash flows that were previously estimated is not insignificant;

      * (c) a right to, or a part of a right to, a financial benefit under the arrangement is written off as a bad debt.

    * (3) You do not reestimate a gain or loss from a *financial arrangement under subsection (4) merely because of any one or more of the following:

      * (a) a change in the credit rating, or the creditworthiness, of a party or parties to the financial arrangement;

      * (b) the impairment (within the meaning of the *accounting standards) of the arrangement or a debt that forms part of the arrangement.

    * Nature of reestimation

    * (4) Making a reestimation in relation to a gain or loss under this subsection involves:

      * (a) a fresh determination of the amount of the gain or loss; and

      * (b) a reapplication of the accruals method to the redetermined gain or loss to make a fresh allocation of the part of the redetermined gain or loss that has not already been allocated to intervals ending before the reestimation is made to intervals ending after the reestimation is made.

    * Basis for reestimation

    * (5) You may make the fresh allocation of the gain or loss under subsection (4) on either of the following bases:

      * (a) by maintaining the rate of return being used and adjusting the amount to which you apply the rate of return to the present value of the estimated future cash flows discounted at the maintained rate of return;

      * (b) adjusting the rate of return and maintaining the amount to which you apply the rate of return.

    * The object to be achieved by both bases is allow you to bring the remainder of the gain or loss based on the new estimates properly to account over the remainder of the period over which you spread the gain or loss.

    * (6) If you adopt a particular basis under subsection (5) for a gain or loss from the *financial arrangement, you must use the same basis for all the reestimations you make under this section in relation to your gains and losses from all your financial arrangements.

    * Balancing adjustment if rate of return maintained

    * (7) If you make a fresh allocation of the gain or loss on the basis referred to in paragraph (5)(a), you must make the following balancing adjustment:

      * (a) if you reestimate a gain and the amount to which you apply the rate of return increases--you make a gain from the *financial arrangement, for the income year in which you make the reestimation, equal to the amount of the increase;

      * (b) if you reestimate a gain and the amount to which you apply the rate of return decreases--you make a loss from the arrangement, for the income year in which you make the reestimation, equal to the amount of the decrease;

      * (c) if you reestimate a loss and the amount to which you apply the rate of return increases--you make a loss from the arrangement, for the income year in which you make the reestimation, equal to the amount of the increase;

      * (d) if you reestimate a loss and the amount to which you apply the rate of return decreases--you make a gain from the arrangement, the income year in which you make the reestimation, equal to the amount of the decrease.

##### 250260  Reestimation if balancing adjustment on partial disposal

    * Reestimation if balancing adjustment on partial disposal

    * (1) You also reestimate a gain or loss from a *financial arrangement under subsection (2) if a balancing adjustment is made in relation to the financial arrangement under sections 250265 to 250275 because you transfer to another person:

      * (a) a proportionate share of all of your rights and/or obligations under a *financial arrangement; or

      * (b) a right or obligation that you have under a financial arrangement to a specifically identified *financial benefit; or

      * (c) a proportionate share of a right or obligation that you have under a financial arrangement to a specifically identified financial benefit.

    * You must reestimate the gain or loss as soon as reasonably practicable after the transfer occurs.

    * Nature of reestimation

    * (2) Making a reestimation in relation to a gain or loss under this subsection involves:

      * (a) a fresh determination of the amount of the gain or loss disregarding:

        * (i) *financial benefits; and

        * (ii) amounts of the gain or loss that have already been allocated to intervals ending before the reestimation is made;

      * to the extent to which they are reasonably attributable to the proportionate share, or the right or obligation, referred to in paragraph (1)(b); and

      * (b) a reapplication of the accruals method to the redetermined gain or loss to make a fresh allocation of the part of that gain or loss that has not already been allocated to intervals ending before the reestimation is made to intervals ending after the reestimation is made.

    * Basis for reestimation

    * (3) You make the fresh allocation of the gain or loss under subsection (2) by maintaining the rate of return being used and adjusting the amount to which you apply the rate of return to the present value of the estimated future cash flows discounted at the maintained rate of return. The object to be achieved by the fresh allocation is allow you to bring the remainder of the redetermined gain or loss properly to account over the remainder of the period over which you spread the gain or loss.

##### Balancing adjustment

##### 250265  When balancing adjustment made

    * When balancing adjustment made

    * (1) A balancing adjustment is made under section 250275 if:

      * (a) you transfer to another person all of your rights and/or obligations under the *financial arrangement; or

      * (b) all of your rights and/or obligations under the financial arrangement otherwise substantially cease; or

      * (c) you transfer to another person:

        * (i) a proportionate share of all of your rights and/or obligations under the financial arrangement; or

        * (ii) a right or obligation that you have under the financial arrangement to a specifically identified *financial benefit; or

        * (iii) a proportionate share of a right or obligation that you have under the financial arrangement to a specifically identified financial benefit.

    * Modifications for arrangements that are assets

    * (2) The following modifications are made if the *financial arrangement is an asset of yours at the time the event referred to in subsection (1) occurs:

      * (a) paragraphs (1)(a) and (c) do not apply unless the effect of the transfer is to transfer to the other person substantially all the risks and rewards of ownership of the interest transferred;

      * (b) for the purposes of applying section 250275 to the arrangement, you are treated as transferring a right under the arrangement to another person if:

        * (i) you retain the right but assume a new obligation; and

        * (ii) your assumption of the new obligation has the same effect, in substance, as transferring the right to another person; and

        * (iii) the new obligation arises only to the extent to which the right to *financial benefits under the financial arrangement is satisfied; and

        * (iv) you cannot sell or pledge the right (other than as security in relation to the new obligation); and

        * (v) you must, under the new obligation, provide financial benefits you receive in relation to the right to the person to whom you owe the new obligation without delay.

##### 250270  Exception for subsidiary member leaving consolidated group

    * A balancing adjustment is not made under section 250275 in relation to a subsidiary member of a*consolidated group or a *MEC group that has the *financial arrangement ceasing to be a member of the group.

##### 250275  Balancing adjustment

    * Complete cessation or transfer

    * (1) Use the following method statement to make the balancing adjustment if paragraph 250265(1)(a) or (b) applies:

Method statement for balancing adjustment

        * Step 1.	Add up the following:

          * (a) the total of all the *financial benefits provided to you under the *financial arrangement;

          * (b) the amount or value of any other consideration you receive in relation to the transfer or cessation referred to in subsection 250265(1);

          * (c) the total of the amounts that have been allowed to you as deductions, because of circumstances that have occurred before the transfer or cessation, for losses from the arrangement;

          * (d) the total of the other amounts that would have been allowed to you as deductions, because of circumstances that have occurred before the transfer or cessation, for losses from the arrangement if all your losses from the arrangement were allowable as deductions.

        * Step 2.	Add up the following:

          * (a) the total of all the *financial benefits you have provided under the *financial arrangement;

          * (b) the amount or value of any other consideration you provide in relation to the transfer or cessation referred to in subsection 250265(1);

          * (c) the total of the amounts that have been included in your assessable income, because of circumstances that have occurred before the transfer or cessation, as gains from the arrangement;

          * (d) the total of the other amounts that would have been included in your assessable income, because of circumstances that have occurred before the transfer or cessation, as gains from the arrangement if all your gains from the arrangement were assessable.

        * Step 3.	Compare the amount obtained under Step 1 (the **_Step 1 amount_**) with the amount obtained under Step 2 (the **_Step 2 amount_**). If the Step 1 amount exceeds the Step 2 amount, an amount equal to the excess is taken, as a balancing adjustment, to be a gain you make from the *financial arrangement for the purposes of this Subdivision. If the Step 2 amount exceeds the Step 1 amount, an amount equal to the excess is taken, as a balancing adjustment, to be a loss that you make from the arrangement. If the Step 1 amount and the Step 2 amount are equal, no balancing adjustment is made.

    * Proportionate transfer of all rights and/or obligations under financial arrangement

    * (2) If subparagraph 250265(1)(c)(i) applies, you make the balancing adjustment by applying the method statement in subsection (1) but reduce:

      * (a) the amounts referred to in paragraphs (a), (c) and (d) in step 1; and

      * (b) the amounts referred to in paragraphs (a), (c) and (d) in step 2;

    * by applying the proportion referred to in subparagraph 250265(1)(c)(i) to them.

    * Transfer of specifically identified right or obligation under financial arrangement

    * (3) If subparagraph 250265(1)(c)(ii) applies, you make the balancing adjustment by applying the method statement in subsection (1) as if the references to:

      * (a) the amounts referred to in paragraphs (a), (c) and (d) in step 1; and

      * (b) the amounts referred to in paragraphs (a), (c) and (d) in step 2;

    * were references to those amounts to the extent to which they are reasonably attributable to the right or obligation referred to in subparagraph 250265(1)(c)(ii).

    * Proportionate transfer of specifically identified right or obligation under financial arrangement

    * (4) If subparagraph 250265(1)(c)(iii) applies, you make the balancing adjustment by applying the method statement:

      * (a) as if the references to:

        * (i) the amounts referred to in paragraphs (a), (c) and (d) in step 1; and

        * (ii) the amounts referred to in paragraphs (a), (c) and (d) in step 2;

      * were references to those amounts to the extent to which they are reasonably attributable to the right or obligation referred to in subparagraph 250265(1)(c)(iii); and

      * (b) by reducing those amounts by applying the proportion referred to in subparagraph 250265(1)(c)(iii) to them.

    * Attribution must reflect appropriate and commercially accepted valuation principles

      * (a) this Division applies to you and an asset; and

      * (b) the *arrangement period for the *tax preferred use of the asset ends at a particular time; and

    * the adjustable value of the asset, immediately after the end of the arrangement period, is taken to be equal to the amount worked out using the following method statement:

Method statement

        * Step 1.	Work out whether section 250150 applies.

        * Step 2.	If section 250150 does not apply, the amount is the *end value of the asset at the end of the arrangement period.

        * Step 3.	If section 250150 does apply, the amount is worked out by:

          * (a) multiplying the *end value of the asset at the end of the *arrangement period by the *disallowed capital percentage; and

          * (b) then multiplying the adjustable value of the asset at the end of the arrangement period (worked out under section 4085) by 100% minus the disallowed capital percentage); and

          * (c) then adding the amount obtained under paragraph (a) and the amount obtained under paragraph (b).

    * (2) If:

      * (a) this Division applies to you and an asset; and

      * (b) the *arrangement period for the *tax preferred use of the asset ends; and

    * the *cost base, and the *reduced cost base, of the asset are each taken to be reduced at the end of the arrangement period by an amount equal to the sum of:

      * (d) the total amounts or values of the financial benefits that were subject to deemed loan treatment; and

      * (e) the net amount referred to in paragraph (c).

          * Note: See subsection (6) in relation to the application of paragraph (d).

    * then, in determining the profit or loss on the sale of the asset, a deduction equal to the difference between the following is taken to have been allowed for expenditure by you in connection with the asset:

      * (d) the total amounts or values of the financial benefits that were subject to deemed loan treatment; and

      * (e) the net amount referred to in paragraph (c).

          * Note: See subsection (6) in relation to the application of paragraph (d).

    * (5) If:

      * (a) this Division applies to you and an asset; and

      * (b) the *arrangement period for the *tax preferred use of the asset ends; and

      * (c) a net amount is allowed to you as a deduction in relation to the *financial benefits that are *subject to the deemed loan treatment (taking into account the adjustments under Subdivision 250E in relation to the financial benefits that are subject to the deemed loan treatment);

    * then, in determining the profit or loss on the sale of the asset, a deduction equal to the sum of the following is taken to have been allowed for expenditure by you in connection with the asset:

      * (d) the total amounts or values of the financial benefits that were subject to deemed loan treatment; and

      * (e) the net amount referred to in paragraph (c).

      * (c) the event would have been a *balancing adjustment event for the asset for the purposes of Subdivision 40D if this Division had not applied to you and the asset when the event happened.

    * (2) A balancing adjustment is made under Subdivision 40D as if:

    * This Act applies to a payment of an entitlement under Division 2AA (Financial claims scheme for accountholders with insolvent ADIs) of Part II of the _Banking Act 1959_ as if the payment were made by the ADI under the agreement for the account concerned.

    * Special rules prevent the arising and payment of such an entitlement from creating inappropriate capital gains or losses affecting assessable income.

##### Operative provisions

##### 2535  Payment of entitlement under financial claims scheme treated as payment from ADI

    * (1) This Act applies to you as if an amount paid to you, or applied for your benefit, to meet your entitlement under Division 2AA (Financial claims scheme for accountholders with insolvent ADIs) of Part II of the _Banking Act 1959_ connected with an account with an *ADI had been paid to you by the ADI under the terms and conditions of the agreement for keeping the account.

          * Note: This section has effect subject to more detailed provisions about:

           * (a) entitlements relating to retirement savings accounts (see section 30625); and

           * (b) entitlements relating to farm management deposits (see Subdivision 393C).

    * (2) To avoid doubt, subsection (1) does not affect the operation of Part 25 in Schedule 1 to the _Taxation Administration Act 1953_.

          * Note: Division 21 in Schedule 1 to the _Taxation Administration Act 1953_ contains special provisions about how Part 25 in that Schedule operates in relation to the meeting of entitlements under Division 2AA of Part II of the _Banking Act 1959_.

##### 25310  Disposal of rights against ADI to APRA and meeting of financial claims scheme entitlement have no CGT effects

    * Disregard a *capital gain or *capital loss you make:

      * (a) because of the operation of section 16AI of the _Banking Act 1959_; or

      * (b) because your entitlement under Subdivision C of Division 2AA of Part II of that Act is met.

          * Note: Section 16AI of the _Banking Act 1959_ reduces the right of an accountholder who has a protected account with a declared ADI to be paid an amount by the ADI, by the accountholder's entitlement under Subdivision C of Division 2AA of Part II of that Act to be paid an amount by APRA in connection with the account.

##### 25315  Cost base of financial claims scheme entitlement and any remaining part of account that gave rise to entitlement

    * (1) This section applies if an entitlement arises under Division 2AA (Financial claims scheme for accountholders with insolvent ADIs) of Part II of the _Banking Act 1959_ in connection with an accountholder's account with an *ADI.

    * (2) The *cost base and *reduced cost base of the *CGT asset consisting of the entitlement are each the amount of the entitlement.

    * (3) The *cost base of the *CGT asset representing the part (if any) of the accountholder's right to be paid an amount by the *ADI in connection with the account that remains after the reduction of that right by section 16AI of the _Banking Act 1959_ (by the amount of the entitlement) is the difference (if any) between:

      * (a) the cost base of the right as it was immediately before the reduction; and

      * (b) the amount of the entitlement.

    * The *reduced cost base is worked out similarly.

    * (4) This section has effect despite:

      * (a) Division 110 (Cost base and reduced cost base); and

      * (b) subsections 11230(2), (3), (4) and (5) (which are about apportioning a *cost base if a *CGT event happens to only part of a *CGT asset).

          * Note: If a trading trust is treated as a managed investment trust for the purposes of this Division for an income year, sections 275100 (CGT to be primary code for calculating MIT gains or losses) and 275120 (revenue account treatment) will not apply to the trust for the year (see subsections 275100(1), 275110(1) and 275120(1)).

      * (c) the trust satisfies the licensing requirements in section 12403 of that Schedule in relation to the income year.

    * (2) A requirement in paragraph (1)(a) is satisfied if, and only if, it is satisfied:

      * (a) at the time the trustee of the trust makes the first *fund payment in relation to the income year; or

      * (b) if the trustee does not make such a payment in relation to the income year--at both the start and the end of the income year.

##### 27520  No fund payment made in relation to the income year

    * For the purposes of this Division, treat a trust in the same way as a *managed investment trust in relation to an income year if:

      * (a) the trustee of the trust does not make a *fund payment in relation to the income year; and

      * (c) the trust would be a managed investment trust in relation to the income year (or a trust that would be treated in the same way as a managed investment trust in relation to the income year through the operation of this Subdivision) if the trustee of the trust had made the first fund payment in relation to the income year on the last day of the income year.

##### 27530  Temporary circumstances outside the control of the trustee

    * If, apart from a particular circumstance, a trust would be treated under this Subdivision in the same way as a *managed investment trust in relation to an income year, treat the trust in the same way as a managed investment trust in relation to the income year for the purposes of this Division if:

      * (a) the circumstance is temporary; and

      * (b) the circumstance arose outside the control of the trustee of the trust; and

      * (c) it is fair and reasonable to treat the trust as a managed investment trust in relation to the income year, having regard to the following matters:

        * (i) the matters in paragraphs (a) and (b);

        * (ii) the nature of the circumstance;

        * (iii) the actions (if any) taken by the trustee of the trust to address or remove the circumstance, and the speed with which such actions are taken;

        * (iv) the extent to which treating the trust as a managed investment trust in relation to the income year would increase or reduce the amount of tax otherwise payable by the trustee, the beneficiaries of the trust or any other entity;

        * (v) any other relevant matter.

##### 27535  Application of subsections 102L(15) and 102T(16)

        * (i) the matters in paragraphs (a), (b) and (c);

        * (ii) the nature of the circumstance;

        * (iii) the actions (if any) taken by the trustee of the trust to address or remove the circumstance, and the speed with which such actions are taken;

        * (v) any other relevant matter.

##### 275115  MIT CGT choices

      * (b) in the circumstances mentioned in paragraph (3)(b)--for the 200809 income year and later income years.

##### 275120  Consequences of not making choice--revenue account treatment

    * (1) This section applies if:

      * (a) the requirements in subsection 275100(1) are met in relation to a *CGT asset held by a *managed investment trust, apart from the requirement in paragraph 275100(1)(f); and

      * (b) the CGT asset is not:

        * (i) land (including an interest in land); or

##### 2801  Effect of this Division

    * (1) This Division is a *Guide.

    * (2) Tax concessions in this Part are intended to encourage Australians to save in order to make provision for their retirement, recognising that superannuation investments, and the income from them, are quarantined for retirement.

##### 2805  Overview

    * (1) There are 3 phases in the tax treatment of superannuation, as follows:

      * (a) the contributions phase;

      * (b) the investment phase;

      * (c) the benefits phase.

    * (2) In the contributions phase, contributions are made to a superannuation plan in respect of a member of the plan.

    * (3) In the investment phase, these contributions are invested by the superannuation provider.

    * (4) In the benefits phase, these contributions, plus earnings from investing them, are usually paid as benefits to the member when he or she retires after reaching preservation age. In the event of death, the benefits are usually paid to the member's dependants.

    * (5) There is also a regulatory scheme outside this Act that is relevant to the taxation treatment of superannuation. For example, other Acts set out prudential and operating standards for superannuation providers.

##### Contributions phase

##### 28010  Contributions phase--deductibility

    * Contributions that can be deducted

    * (1) Employers can usually deduct contributions they make in respect of their employees. Individuals can usually deduct contributions they make in respect of themselves if less than 10% of their total assessable income (plus reportable fringe benefits) for the income year is attributable to employment or similar activities.

    * Other contributions cannot be deducted

    * (2) Other contributions cannot be deducted. These include personal contributions made by individuals whose employment income is 10% or more of their total income, and contributions made by others in respect of them (such as contributions by a spouse or family member, or Government cocontributions).

##### 28015  Contributions phase--limits on superannuation tax concessions

    * (1) There is a limit to contributions that can be made in respect of an individual in a year that receive favourable tax treatment. This limit takes the form of a tax on excessive contributions, and neutralises the favourable tax treatment arising from the excessive contributions.

    * (2) If concessional contributions exceed an indexed cap, the excess is included in the individual's assessable income and gives rise to a tax offset. The individual can release the excess concessional contributions from his or her superannuation interests.

    * (3) If nonconcessional contributions exceed an indexed cap, the individual can:

      * (a) elect to release an amount corresponding to that excess, and 85% of the associated earnings on that excess, from the individual's superannuation interests; or

      * (b) elect not to release such an amount if the value of the individual's superannuation interests is nil.

    * An amount corresponding to those associated earnings is then included in the individual's assessable income and gives rise to a tax offset.

    * (4) The individual is taxed:

      * (a) if the amount released as described in paragraph (3)(a) fell short of that excess--on that shortfall; or

      * (b) on that excess, if the individual did not make either of those elections.

    * An amount equal to this tax liability must be released from the individual's superannuation interests.

##### Investment phase

##### 28020  Investment phase

    * (1) Contributions that can be deducted are assessable income of the superannuation provider. Contributions that cannot be deducted are not assessable income of the superannuation provider. (There are some exceptions.)

    * (2) Earnings on the investment of amounts in a superannuation plan are assessable income of the superannuation provider.

    * (3) The superannuation provider's taxable income is generally taxed at the concessional rate of 15%.

    * (4) However, superannuation providers pay no tax on earnings from the assets that support the payment of benefits in the form of income streams, once the income streams have commenced.

##### Benefits phase

##### 28025  Benefits phase--different types of superannuation benefit

    * Superannuation benefits can be drawn down as lump sums, income streams (such as pensions or annuities), or combinations of both. Different tax treatment may apply depending on whether a lump sum or income stream is paid.

##### 28030  Benefits phase--taxation varies with age of recipient and type of benefit

    * (1) The taxation of superannuation benefits depends primarily on the age of the member.

    * (2) If the member is aged 60 or over, superannuation benefits (both lump sums and income streams) are tax free if the benefits have already been subject to tax in the fund (that is, where the benefits comprise a taxed element). This covers the great majority of superannuation members.

    * (3) Where a superannuation benefit contains an amount that has not been subject to tax in the fund (an untaxed element), this element is subject to tax for those aged 60 or over, though at concessional rates. This is relevant generally to those people (for example, public servants), who are members of a superannuation fund established by the Australian Government or a state government.

    * (4) If the member is less than 60, superannuation benefits may receive concessional taxation treatment, though the treatment is less concessional than for those aged 60 and over.

    * (5) Superannuation benefits may also include a "tax free component"; this component of the benefit is always paid tax free.

    * (6) Additional tax concessions may apply when superannuation benefits are paid after a member's death.

##### 28035  Benefits phase--rollovers

    * A member can "roll over" their superannuation benefits from one complying superannuation plan to another, or between different interests in the same plan. This is usually done to keep the benefits invested in the superannuation system, or to convert a lump sum to a superannuation income stream. No tax is generally payable until the benefits are finally drawn down.

##### The regulatory scheme outside this Act

##### 28040  Other relevant legislative schemes

    * (1) The _Superannuation Industry (Supervision) Act 1993 _and the _Retirement Savings Accounts Act 1997 _regulate the prudential and operating standards for superannuation providers. Concessional tax treatment is generally available only if providers comply with these standards.

    * (2) Other legislative schemes relevant to superannuation include the following:

      * (a) the _Superannuation Guarantee (Administration) Act 1992_, which requires that employers provide a minimum level of superannuation contributions for each of their eligible employees;

      * (b) the _Superannuation (Government Cocontribution for Low Income Earners) Act 2003_, which provides for Government cocontributions to low income earners' superannuation;

      * (c) the _Small Superannuation Accounts Act 1995_, which provides a facility to accept payments of superannuation guarantee shortfalls;

      * (d) the _Superannuation (Unclaimed Money and Lost Members) Act 1999_, which provides for the payment of unclaimed superannuation money, and the maintenance of a register of lost members.

#### Division 285--General concepts relating to superannuation

##### 2855  Transfers of property

    * (1) Any of the following payments covered by this Part can be or include a transfer of property:

      * (a) a contribution;

      * (b) a *superannuation lump sum.

    * (2) The amount of the payment is or includes the *market value of the property.

    * (3) The *market value is reduced by the value of any consideration given for the transfer of the property.

      * (a) a contribution for which you or another entity have deducted or can deduct an amount for any income year; or

      * (b) earnings on a contribution of that kind.

          * Note: An example of an indirect return of a contribution is if the fund to which it was made transfers to another fund assets that include the contribution, and the other fund returns the contribution to the person who made it.

       * 2925	Object of this Division

##### 2925  Object of this Division

    * The object of this Division is to ensure, in relation to _nonconcessional_ contributions to superannuation, that the amount of concessionally taxed *superannuation benefits that an individual receives results from contributions that have been made gradually over the course of the individual's life.

          * Note: Division 291 has the same object, in relation to concessional contributions.

##### Subdivision 292B--Assessable income and tax offset

##### 29220  Amount in assessable income, and tax offset, relating to your nonconcessional contributions

    * Your assessable income for an income year includes an amount, and you are entitled to a *tax offset for the income year, if:

      * (a) you receive one or more *excess nonconcessional contributions determinations for a *financial year that corresponds to the income year; and

      * (b) you make one or more elections under paragraph 967(1)(a) or (b) in Schedule 1 to the _Taxation Administration Act 1953_ in relation to those determinations.

##### 29225  Amount included in assessable income

    * (2) However, if:

      * (a) the sum of any amounts paid to you in response to release authorities issued in relation to those determinations (the **_total amount_**) is less than the amount of the excess stated in the most recent of those determinations; and

      * (b) section 292467 does not apply to you for the *financial year;

    * the amount included in your assessable income for the income year is equal to the amount of associated earnings that would have been stated in that most recent determination if the total amount had been the amount of the excess stated in that determination.

          * Note 1: The amount included in your assessable income may be nil.

          * Note 2: Any amounts paid to you in response to those release authorities are nonassessable nonexempt income (see section 30317).

##### 29230  Amount of the tax offset

    * The *tax offset is equal to 15% of the amount included in your assessable income for the income year under section 29225.

          * Note 1: This tax offset compensates for any tax liability of the superannuation provider on earnings from investments made with the contributions making up the excess amount stated in the most recent determination.

##### 29510  How to work out the tax payable by superannuation entities

    * (1) Use this method for *superannuation funds, *approved deposit funds and *pooled superannuation trusts:

    * _Method statement_

        * _Step 1.	For a *superannuation fund, work out the *noTFN contributions income. Apply the applicable rates as set out in the _Income Tax Rates Act 1986_ to that income.

        * Step 2.	Work out the entity's assessable income and deductions taking account of the special rules in this Division. The special rules modify some provisions of this Act. They also include amounts in assessable income, allow deductions and exempt amounts from income tax.

        * Step 3.	Work out the entity's taxable income as if its trustee:

          * (a) were an Australian resident (except where paragraph (b) applies); or

          * (b) for a *noncomplying superannuation fund that is a *foreign superannuation fund for the income year--were not an Australian resident.

        * Step 4.	Work out the *low tax component and *nonarm's length component of the taxable income of a *complying superannuation fund, *complying approved deposit fund or *pooled superannuation trust.

        * Step 5.	Apply the applicable rates as set out in the _Income Tax Rates Act 1986_ to the components, or to the taxable income of a *noncomplying superannuation fund or *noncomplying approved deposit fund.

        * Step 6.	Subtract the entity's *tax offsets from the step 5 amount or, for a *superannuation fund, from the sum of the fund's step 1 and step 5 amounts.

    * (2) Use this method for *RSA providers:

    * _Method statement_

        * _Step 1.	Work out the entity's *noTFN contributions income. Apply the applicable rates as set out in the _Income Tax Rates Act 1986_ to that income.

        * Step 2.	Work out the entity's assessable income and deductions taking account of the special rules in this Division.

        * Step 3.	Work out the *RSA component and *standard component of the entity's taxable income.

        * Step 4.	If the entity is also an *FHSA provider, work out the *FHSA component of the entity's taxable income.

        * Step 5.	Apply the applicable rates as set out in the _Income Tax Rates Act 1986_ to the components. The *RSA component and the *FHSA component are taxed at a concessional rate.

        * Step 6.	Subtract the entity's *tax offsets from the sum of the entity's step 1 and step 5 amounts.

##### 29515  Division does not impose a tax on property of a State

    * This Division does not impose a tax on property of any kind belonging to a State (within the meaning of section 114 of the Constitution).

##### 29520  Exempting laws ineffective

    * A *Commonwealth law (other than this Act) does not have the effect of exempting the trustee of an entity to which this Division applies from the liability to pay tax unless it does so expressly.

##### 29525  Assessments on basis of anticipated SIS Act notice

    * (1) The Commissioner may make an assessment for a fund or trust that is not a *complying superannuation fund, *complying approved deposit fund or *pooled superannuation trust for the income year as if it were such an entity if the Commissioner considers it likely that a notice will be given under section 40 of the _Superannuation Industry (Supervision) Act 1993_ having the effect that it will become such an entity.

    * (2) However, the grounds for making an assessment under subsection (1) are taken never to have existed if:

      * (a) the Commissioner becomes satisfied that the notice will not be given; or

      * (b) *APRA does not receive the documents referred to in subsection 36(1) of the _Superannuation Industry (Supervision) Act 1993_ about the fund or trust before the end of 12 months after the assessment is made.

##### 29530  Effect of revocation etc. of SIS Act notices

    * This Division has effect as if a notice given under section 342 of the _Superannuation Industry (Supervision) Act 1993_ (about pre1 July 88 funding credits) or under regulations made for the purposes of that section had never been given if:

      * (a) the notice is revoked; or

      * (b) the decision to give the notice is set aside.

      * (b) the trustee owned at the commencement of this section;

    * as if the trustee had *acquired the asset on 30 June 1988.

    * (4) Subsection 10430(5) applies to an option granted by the trustee as if the reference in that subsection to 20 September 1985 were a reference to 1 July 1988.

##### 29595  Deductions related to contributions

    * (2) A *superannuation fund is an **_Australian superannuation fund_** at a time, and for the income year in which that time occurs, if:

      * (b) at that time, the central management and control of the fund is ordinarily in Australia; and

      * (c) at that time either the fund had no member covered by subsection (3) (an **_active member_**) or at least 50% of:

        * (i) the total *market value of the fund's assets attributable to *superannuation interests held by active members; or

        * (ii) the sum of the amounts that would be payable to or in respect of active members if they voluntarily ceased to be members;

        * (i) who is a foreign resident; and

        * (ii) who is not a contributor at that time; and

        * (iii) for whom contributions made to the fund on the individual's behalf after the individual became a foreign resident are only payments in respect of a time when the individual was an Australian resident.

    * (4) To avoid doubt, the central management and control of a *superannuation fund is ordinarily in Australia at a time even if that central management and control is temporarily outside Australia for a period of not more than 2 years.

##### 295100  Deductions for investing in PSTs and life policies

    * (1) Provisions of this Act about deducting amounts apply to *complying superannuation funds and *complying approved deposit funds as if *ordinary income and *statutory income received from these investments were included in their assessable income:

##### 295105  Distributions to PST unitholders

    * (2) The entity that made the contributions must consent to the choice.

          * Note: Making this choice effectively shifts the liability for tax on the contributions to the recipient of the benefit. The benefit is treated as an element untaxed in the fund: see Subdivision 301C.

    * Variation notice received before return lodged

    * (1) A contribution is not included in the assessable income of a *complying superannuation fund or *RSA provider under item 1 of the table in subsection 295190(1) to the extent that it has been reduced by a notice under section 290180 if the notice is received by the *superannuation provider before it has lodged its *income tax return for the income year in which the contribution was made.

      * (b) the provider exercises the option mentioned in subsection (3).

    * (3) An amount referred to in subsection (2) may, at the option of the provider, be excluded from the assessable income of the fund or *RSA provider for the income year referred to in subsection (2) if excluding it would result in a greater reduction in tax for that year than the reduction that would occur for the income year in which the notice is received if a deduction were allowed under item 2 of the table in subsection 295490(1).

          * Note: The exclusion is an alternative to the fund deducting the amount under item 2 of the table in subsection 295490(1).

##### 295197  Exclusion of personal contributions--successor funds

    * Scope

    * (1) This section applies to the *superannuation provider (the **_successor provider_**) of a *complying superannuation fund or *RSA if, apart from this section, a *rollover superannuation benefit would be included in the assessable income of the fund or *RSA provider under item 2A of the table in subsection 295190(1).

      * (b) the successor provider exercises the option mentioned in subsection (4).

    * (4) An amount referred to in subsection (3) may, at the option of the successor provider, be excluded from the assessable income of the fund or *RSA provider for the income year referred to in subsection (3) if excluding it would result in a greater reduction in tax for that year than the reduction that would occur for the income year in which the notice is received if a deduction were allowed under item 2B of the table in subsection 295490(1).

          * Note: The exclusion is an alternative to the fund deducting the amount under item 2B of the table in subsection 295490(1).

##### Transfers from foreign funds

##### 295200  Transfers from foreign superannuation funds

    * (1) The assessable income of a fund that is an *Australian superannuation fund for the income year includes an amount transferred to the fund from a fund that was a *foreign superannuation fund for the income year in relation to a member of the foreign fund to the extent that the amount transferred exceeds amounts vested in the member at the time of the transfer.

    * (2) The assessable income of the fund for the income year includes the sum of the *rollover superannuation benefits to the extent that they consist of the *element untaxed in the fund of the *taxable component that would be included in that assessable income if all contributions and earnings accumulated in the fund when the fund ceased to be a *constitutionally protected fund:

      * (a) had been paid out of the fund immediately before it ceased to be a constitutionally protected fund; and

##### Subdivision 295D--Contributions excluded

##### Table of sections

       * 295260	Transfer of liability to investment vehicle

       * 295265	Application of pre1 July 88 funding credits

       * 295270	Anticipated funding credits

##### 295260  Transfer of liability to investment vehicle

    * (1) The *superannuation provider in relation to a *complying superannuation fund or a *complying approved deposit fund (the **_transferor_**) may reduce the amount that would otherwise be included in the fund's assessable income for an income year under Subdivision 295C by agreement with another entity (the **_transferee_**) in which it holds investments.

    * What the transferee must be

    * (2) The transferee must be a *life insurance company or a *pooled superannuation trust.

          * Note: Amounts transferred are included in the transferee's assessable income: see section 295320 (for PSTs) and paragraph 32015(1)(i) (for life insurance companies).

    * Agreement requirements

    * (3) The transferor may make one agreement only for an income year with a particular transferee.

    * (4) An agreement:

      * (a) must be in writing, and must be signed by or for the transferor and transferee; and

      * (b) must be made by the day the transferor lodges its *income tax return for its income year to which the agreement relates; and

      * (c) cannot be revoked.

    * Limits on transfer

    * (5) The total amount covered by the agreements cannot exceed the amount that would otherwise be included in the transferor's assessable income under Subdivision 295C for that income year.

    * (6) The amount covered by an agreement with a particular transferee cannot exceed this amount:

    * where: 

    * **_greatest equity value_** is the greatest of these amounts during the transferor's income year:

      * (a) if the transferee is a *pooled superannuation trust--the *market value of the transferor's investment in units in the trust;

      * (b) if not--the market value of the transferor's investment in:

        * (i) *life insurance policies issued by the transferee; or

        * (ii) a trust whose assets consist only of life insurance policies issued by the transferee.

    * **_transferor's low tax component tax rate_** is the rate of tax imposed on the *low tax component of the fund's taxable income for the income year.

##### 295265  Application of pre1 July 88 funding credits

    * Choice to reduce contributions included in assessable income

    * (1) The *superannuation provider in relation to a *complying superannuation fund can choose to reduce the amount of contributions that would otherwise be included in the fund's assessable income for an income year under item 1 of the table in section 295160 if it has pre1 July 88 funding credits available for the income year.

    * When funding credits are available

    * (2) Use this method to work out whether a fund has pre1 July 88 funding credits available for an income year:

    * _Method statement_

        * _Step 1.	Identify the amount of pre1 July 88 funding credits unused at the end of the previous income year.

        * Step 2.	Index that amount.

             * Note: Subdivision 960M shows you how to index amounts.

        * Step 3.	Add any pre1 July 88 funding credits transferred to the fund in the income year under regulations made for the purposes of subsection 342(7) of the _Superannuation Industry (Supervision) Act 1993_.

        * Step 4.	Deduct from the step 3 amount:

          * (a) pre1 July 88 funding credits transferred from the fund in the income year under regulations made for the purposes of subsection 342(7) of that Act; and

          * (b) amounts specified in a notice given to the *superannuation provider in relation to the fund under subsection 342(6) of that Act for the income year.

        * Step 5.	The result is the pre1 July 88 funding credits available to the fund for the income year.

        * That amount, reduced by any amount specified in a choice made under subsection (1) for the income year, is the amount of pre1 July 88 funding credits unused at the end of the income year.

          * Note 1: Regulations under subsection 342(7) of the SIS Act allow APRA to approve transfers of pre1 July 88 funding credits between funds.

          * Note 2: Subsection 342(6) of that Act covers the situation where the fund's rules are changed to produce a reduction in pre1 July 88 funding credits and the trustee notifies APRA of the change.

    * (3) If a notice is given to the *superannuation provider in relation to the fund under subsection 342(2) of the _Superannuation Industry (Supervision) Act 1993_ granting the trustee a pre1 July 88 funding credit, this section applies as if the pre1 July 88 funding credit had arisen at the beginning of the income year in which 1 July 1988 occurred.

    * (4) However, if a notice is given to the *superannuation provider in relation to the fund under subsection 342(4) of the _Superannuation Industry (Supervision) Act 1993_ for the income year, the fund has no pre1 July 88 funding credits.

          * Note: Subsection 342(4) of that Act covers the situation where the fund's rules are changed to produce a reduction in pre1 July 88 funding credits and the provider fails to notify APRA of the change.

    * Limit on choice

    * (5) The total amount covered by the choice cannot exceed the pre1 July 88 funding credits available to the fund for the income year.

    * (6) The total amount covered by the choice also cannot exceed the amount of contributions that would otherwise be included in the fund's assessable income for the income year under item 1 of the table in section 295160 that are used to fund liabilities that accrued before 1 July 1988.

    * (7) The regulations may prescribe either or both of the following:

      * (a) the manner in which the *superannuation provider in relation to a *superannuation fund is to work out the amount applicable to the fund under subsection (6) for an income year;

      * (b) methods (other than the method specified in subsection (6)) of working out how the provider of a superannuation fund can apply pre1 July 88 funding credits.

    * (8) Methods prescribed under paragraph (7)(b) may be applicable to particular *superannuation funds or to a class or classes of superannuation funds.

##### 295270  Anticipated funding credits

    * (1) Subsection (2) has effect if the *superannuation provider in relation to a *complying superannuation fund expects a notice to be given under subsection 342(2) of the _Superannuation Industry (Supervision) Act 1993_ or under regulations made for the purposes of subsection 342(7) of that Act to the effect that pre1 July 88 funding credits of a particular amount will be available to the fund for the income year.

    * (2) Section 295265 applies to the fund as if pre1 July 88 funding credits of the anticipated amount were available to the fund for the income year (in addition to any other pre1 July 88 funding credits available to the fund for the year).

    * (3) However, section 295265 applies to the fund for the income year as if pre1 July 88 funding credits of the anticipated amount were not available to the fund for the income year if:

      * (a) it becomes clear that the expected notice will not be given or that the specified amount of pre1 July 88 funding credits will not be available; or

      * (b) *APRA does not receive the things referred to in subsection 342(3) of the _Superannuation Industry (Supervision) Act 1993_ (for a notice expected under subsection 342(2) of that Act) or the things required to be given under regulations made for the purposes of subsection 342(7) of that Act (for a notice under those regulations) before the earlier of:

        * (i) the end of 12 months after the fund's assessment is made for the income year; and

        * (ii) the time the things are required to be given by the regulations.

##### Subdivision 295F--Exempt income

##### Table of sections

       * 295385	Income from assets set aside to meet current pension liabilities

       * 295390	Income from other assets used to meet current pension liabilities

       * 295395	Meaning of segregated noncurrent assets

       * 295410	Amount credited to RSA

##### 295385  Income from assets set aside to meet current pension liabilities

    * (1) The *ordinary income and *statutory income of a *complying superannuation fund for an income year is exempt from income tax to the extent that:

      * (a) it would otherwise be assessable income; and

      * (b) it is from *segregated current pension assets.

    * Exception

    * (2) Subsection (1) does not apply to:

      * (a) *nonarm's length income; or

      * (b) amounts included in assessable income under Subdivision 295C.

    * Meaning of **segregated current pension assets**

    * **	(3)	Assets of a *complying superannuation fund are **_segregated current pension assets_** at a time if:

      * (a) the assets are invested, held in reserve or otherwise dealt with at that time solely to enable the fund to discharge all or part of its liabilities (contingent or not) in respect of *superannuation income stream benefits that are payable by the fund at that time; and

      * (b) the trustee of the fund obtains an *actuary's certificate before the date for lodgment of the fund's *income tax return for the income year to the effect that the assets and the earnings that the actuary expects will be made from them would provide the amount required to discharge in full those liabilities, or that part of those liabilities, as they fall due.

    * (4) Assets of a *complying superannuation fund are also **_segregated current pension assets_** of the fund at a time if the assets are invested, held in reserve or otherwise being dealt with at that time for the sole purpose of enabling the fund to discharge all or part of its liabilities (contingent or not), as they become due, in respect of *superannuation income stream benefits:

      * (a) that are payable by the fund at that time; and

      * (b) prescribed by the regulations for the purposes of this section.

    * (5) Subsection (4) does not apply unless, at all times during the income year, the liabilities of the fund (contingent or not) to pay *superannuation income stream benefits payable by the fund were liabilities in respect of superannuation income stream benefits that are prescribed by the regulations for the purposes of this section.

    * (6) However, assets of a *complying superannuation fund that are supporting a *superannuation income stream benefit that is prescribed by the regulations for the purposes of this section are not **_segregated current pension assets_** to the extent that the *market value of the assets exceeds the account balance supporting the benefit.

##### 295390  Income from other assets used to meet current pension liabilities

    * (1) A proportion of the *ordinary income and *statutory income of a *complying superannuation fund that would otherwise be assessable income is exempt from income tax under this section. The proportion is worked out under subsection (3).

    * Exception

    * (2) Subsection (1) does not apply to:

      * (a) *nonarm's length income; or

      * (b) amounts included in assessable income under Subdivision 295C; or

      * (c) income *derived from *segregated noncurrent assets; or

      * (d) income that is exempt from income tax under section 295385.

    * Formula

    * (3) The proportion is:

    * where: 

    * **_average value of current pension liabilities_** is the average value for the income year of the fund's current liabilities (contingent or not) in respect of *superannuation income stream benefits that are payable by the fund in that year. This does not include liabilities for which *segregated current pension assets are held.

    * **_average value of superannuation liabilities_** is the average value for the income year of the fund's current and future liabilities (contingent or not) in respect of *superannuation benefits in respect of which contributions have, or were liable to have, been made. This does not include liabilities for which *segregated current pension assets or *segregated noncurrent assets are held.

    * Actuary's certificate

    * (4) The value of particular liabilities of the fund at a particular time is the amount of the fund's assets, together with future contributions in respect of the benefits concerned and expected earnings on the assets and contributions after that time, that would provide the amount required to discharge those liabilities as they fall due. This must be specified in an *actuary's certificate obtained by the trustee of the fund before the date for lodgment of the fund's *income tax return for the income year.

    * (5) The expected earnings are worked out at the rate the actuary expects will be the rate of the fund's earnings on its assets (except *segregated current pension assets or *segregated noncurrent assets).

    * Superannuation liabilities where no current certificate

    * (6) The superannuation liabilities do not have to be valued by an actuary for the income year if the fund has no *segregated current pension assets or *segregated noncurrent assets for the income year. Instead, the value can be worked out using this formula:

    * where: 

    * **_current value of assets_** is the value of all of the fund's assets at a time in the income year, as specified in an *actuary's certificate obtained by the trustee of the fund before the date for lodgment of the fund's *income tax return for the income year.

    * **_last value of assets_** is the most recent value of all of the fund's assets specified in an *actuary's certificate.

    * **_last value of superannuation liabilities_** is the value, at the time of that most recent valuation, of the fund's superannuation liabilities specified in an *actuary's certificate.

          * Note: This allows a fund to avoid the expense of an actuarial valuation of its superannuation liabilities, except in those years that a valuation is required by the SIS Act in order for the fund to continue to be complying.

    * (7) Subsections (4), (5) and (6) do not apply in working out the amounts to be used in the formula in subsection (3) if, at all times during the income year, the liabilities of the fund in respect of *superannuation income stream benefits payable at those times were liabilities in respect of superannuation income stream benefits that are prescribed by the regulations for the purposes of this subsection.

##### 295395  Meaning of segregated noncurrent assets

    * (1) Assets of a *complying superannuation fund are **_segregated noncurrent assets_** at a time in an income year if:

      * (a) the assets are invested, held in reserve or otherwise dealt with at that time solely to enable the fund to discharge all or part of its current and future liabilities (contingent or not) to pay benefits in respect of which contributions have, or were liable to have, been made; and

      * (b) the trustee of the fund obtains an *actuary's certificate before the date for lodgment of the fund's *income tax return for the income year to the effect that the amount of the assets, together with any future contributions, and the earnings that the actuary expects will be made from them will provide the amount required to discharge in full those liabilities, or that part of those liabilities, as they fall due.

    * (2) The liabilities referred to in paragraph (1)(a) do not include liabilities (contingent or not) in respect of *superannuation income stream benefits payable by the fund at that time.

##### 295400  Income of a PST attributable to current pension liabilities

    * (1) This proportion of the *ordinary income and *statutory income that would otherwise be assessable income of a *pooled superannuation trust is *exempt income:

    * Exceptions

    * (2) Subsection (1) does not apply to:

      * (a) *nonarm's length income; or

      * (b) amounts included in assessable income under item 1 of the table in section 295320.

    * Alternative exemption

    * (3) However, the trustee of the *pooled superannuation trust can choose that a different amount be *exempt income of the trust under this section if a percentage of the assessable income of the trust would have been exempt income under section 295385 or 295390 if it had been *derived instead by the unitholders in the trust in proportion to their holdings.

    * (4) That percentage of the trust's *ordinary income and *statutory income is then *exempt income.

##### 295405  Other exempt income

    * The *ordinary income or *statutory income of an entity is exempt from income tax as set out in this table.

##### 295465  Complying funds--deductions for insurance premiums

    * Deductions for insurance premiums

    * (1) A *complying superannuation fund can deduct the proportions specified in this table of premiums it pays for insurance policies that are (wholly or partly) for current or contingent liabilities of the fund to provide benefits referred to in section 295460 for its members. It can deduct the amounts for the income year in which the premiums are paid.

          * Note: If the fund receives a rebate or refund of an insurance premium, the amount may be included in its assessable income: see table item 4 in section 295320.

    * (1A) If item 5 of the table applies to part, but not all, of an insurance policy premium, item 6 of the table applies to the rest of the premium as if item 5 did not apply to the premium.

    * (1B) For the purposes of item 6 of the table, the regulations may provide that a specified proportion of a specified insurance policy premium may be treated as being attributable to the *complying superannuation fund's liability to provide benefits referred to in section 295460.

          * Note: The fund may deduct a proportion other than that specified in the regulations for the premium, but must obtain an actuary's certificate in accordance with subsection (3) in order to do so. The same applies if the insurance policy premium is not specified in the regulations.

    * Deductions for selfinsurance

    * (2) A *complying superannuation fund can also deduct the amount it could reasonably be expected to pay in an *arm's length transaction to obtain an insurance policy to cover it for that part of its current or contingent liabilities to provide benefits referred to in section 295460 for which it does not have insurance coverage. It can deduct the amount for the income year when it has the liability.

    * (2A) For the purposes of subsection (2), the regulations may provide that a specified proportion of an amount mentioned in subsection (2B) may be treated as being the amount the fund could reasonably be expected to pay in an *arm's length transaction to obtain an insurance policy to cover it for its current or contingent liabilities to provide benefits referred to in section 295460.

          * Example: If:

           * (a) an actuary certifies the amount a fund could reasonably be expected to pay in an arm's length transaction to obtain an insurance policy; and

           * (b) the insurance policy covers liabilities of the fund to provide a class of total and permanent disability benefits broader than that covered by section 295460; and

           * (c) the insurance policy is specified in the regulations; and

           * (d) the fund does not have insurance coverage for the liabilities;

          * the fund may deduct, under subsection (2), so much of that certified amount as is specified in the regulations.

    * (2B) The amount is the amount a *complying superannuation fund could reasonably be expected to pay in an *arm's length transaction to obtain an insurance policy specified in the regulations.

    * Actuary's certificate

    * (3) The trustee must obtain an *actuary's certificate before the date for lodgment of the fund's *income tax return for the income year in order to deduct an amount referred to in item 6 of the table or in subsection (2).

    * (3A) Subsection (3) does not apply to an amount referred to in item 6 of the table in relation to an insurance policy premium, if the trustee deducts, under that item, only the proportion (if any) of the premium specified in the regulations made for the purposes of subsection (1B).

    * Choice not to deduct amounts under this section

    * (4) The trustee may choose not to deduct amounts under this section for an income year and to deduct instead (under section 295470) amounts based on the fund's future liability to pay the benefits.

    * (5) The choice applies also to future income years unless the Commissioner decides that it should not.

        * (ii) a benefit referred to in paragraph 295460(c).

    * (2) The amount the fund can deduct is:

    * where: 

    * **_benefit amount_** is:

      * (a) for a benefit that is a *superannuation lump sum--the amount of the lump sum; or

      * (b) for a benefit that is a *superannuation income stream--the *value of the *superannuation interest supporting the income stream; or

      * (c) for a benefit referred to in paragraph 295460(c)--the total of the amounts paid during the income year.

    * **_future service days_** is the number of days in the period starting when:

      * (a) the termination happened; or

      * (b) for a benefit referred to in paragraph 295460(c)--the member became unable to engage in *gainful employment;

    * and ending on the member's *last retirement day.

    * **_total service days_** is the sum of future service days and the number of days in:

      * (a) for a benefit that is a *superannuation lump sum--the *service period for the superannuation lump sum; or

        * (i) the day on which the member joined the relevant *superannuation fund; and

        * (ii) the first day of the period of employment to which the benefit relates (including a qualifying period before the member could join the fund and any period when the member was not a member of the fund); and

        * (iii) the day applicable under subsection (3).

##### 295475  RSA providers--deductions for insurance premiums

    * An *RSA provider can deduct premiums it pays for insurance policies that are wholly for its liability to provide benefits referred to in section 295460 for its *RSA holders. It can deduct the amounts for the income year in which the premiums are paid.

          * Note: If the RSA provider receives a rebate or refund of an insurance premium, the amount may be included in its assessable income: see table item 5 in section 295320.

        * (ii) the death of the individual insured if that happens before that day;

    * but does not include a *whole of life policy.

##### Increased amount of superannuation lump sum death benefits

##### 295485  Deductions for increased amount of superannuation lump sum death benefit

    * (1) An entity that is a *complying superannuation fund, or a *complying approved deposit fund, and has been since 1 July 1988 (or since it came into existence if that was later) can deduct an amount under this section if:

      * (a) it pays a *superannuation lump sum because of the death of a person to the trustee of the deceased's estate or an individual who was a *spouse, former spouse or *child of the deceased at the time of death or payment; and

      * (b) it increases the lump sum by an amount, or does not reduce the lump sum by an amount (the **_tax saving amount_**) so that the amount of the lump sum is the amount that the fund could have paid if no tax were payable on amounts included in assessable income under Subdivision 295C.

          * Note: Paragraph (1)(b) has effect as if the reference to amounts included in assessable income under Subdivision 295C included a reference to amounts included in assessable income under former section 274 of the _Income Tax Assessment Act 1936_: see section 295485 of the _Income Tax (Transitional Provisions) Act 1997_.

##### 295545  Components of taxable income--complying superannuation funds, complying ADFs and PSTs

    * (1) The taxable income of these entities is split into a *nonarm's length component and a *low tax component:

      * (a) *complying superannuation funds;

      * (b) *complying approved deposit funds;

      * (c) *pooled superannuation trusts.

          * Note: A concessional rate applies to the low tax component, while the nonarm's length component is taxed at the highest marginal rate. The rates are set out in the _Income Tax Rates Act 1986_.

    * (2) The **_nonarm's length component_** for an income year is the entity's *nonarm's length income for that year less any deductions to the extent that they are attributable to that income.

    * (3) The **_low tax component_** is any remaining part of the entity's taxable income for the income year.

##### 295550  Meaning of nonarm's length income

    * (1) An amount of *ordinary income or *statutory income is **_nonarm's length income_** of a *complying superannuation fund, a *complying approved deposit fund or a *pooled superannuation trust (other than an amount to which subsection (2) applies or an amount *derived by the entity in the capacity of beneficiary of a trust) if:

      * (a) it is derived from a *scheme the parties to which were not dealing with each other at *arm's length in relation to the scheme; and

      * (b) that amount is more than the amount that the entity might have been expected to derive if those parties had been dealing with each other at arm's length in relation to the scheme.

    * (2) An amount of *ordinary income or *statutory income is also **_nonarm's length income_** of the entity if it is:

      * (a) a *dividend paid to the entity by a *private company; or

      * (b) ordinary income or statutory income that is reasonably attributable to such a dividend;

    * unless the amount is consistent with an *arm's length dealing.

    * (3) In deciding whether an amount is consistent with an *arm's length dealing under subsection (2), have regard to:

      * (a) the value of *shares in the company that are assets of the entity; and

      * (b) the cost to the entity of the shares on which the *dividend was paid; and

      * (c) the rate of that dividend; and

      * (d) whether the company has paid a dividend on other shares in the company and, if so, the rate of that dividend; and

      * (e) whether the company has issued any shares to the entity in satisfaction of a dividend paid by the company (or part of it) and, if so, the circumstances of the issue; and

      * (f) any other relevant matters.

    * (4) Income *derived by the entity as a beneficiary of a trust, other than because of holding a fixed entitlement to the income, is **_nonarm's length income_** of the entity.

    * (5) Other income *derived by the entity as a beneficiary of a trust through holding a fixed entitlement to the income of the trust is **_nonarm's length income_** of the entity if:

      * (a) the entity acquired the entitlement under a *scheme, or the income was derived under a scheme, the parties to which were not dealing with each other at *arm's length; and

      * (b) the amount of the income is more than the amount that the entity might have been expected to derive if those parties had been dealing with each other at arm's length.

    * (6) This section:

      * (a) applies to a *nonshare equity interest in the same way as it applies to a *share; and

      * (b) applies to an *equity holder in a company in the same way as it applies to a shareholder in the company; and

      * (c) applies to a *nonshare dividend in the same way as it applies to a *dividend.

##### 295555  Components of taxable income--RSA providers

    * (1) The taxable income of an *RSA provider is split into:

      * (a) an *RSA component; and

      * (b) if the RSA provider is also an *FHSA provider--an *FHSA component; and

      * (c) a *standard component.

          * Note: The RSA component and the FHSA component (if applicable) are taxed at the same concessional rate that applies to the low tax component of complying superannuation funds, complying approved deposit funds and pooled superannuation trusts (see section 23 of the _Income Tax Rates Act 1986_). The standard component is taxed at the standard company rate.

    * (2) The **_RSA component_** for an income year is worked out in this way:

    * _Method statement_

        * _Step 1.	Add these amounts included in the provider's assessable income for the income year:

          * (a) amounts included under Subdivision 295C; and

          * (b) other amounts credited during the year to *RSAs that it provides.

        * Step 2.	Subtract from the step 1 amount amounts paid from those *RSAs (except benefits for the RSA holders or tax).

        * Step 3.	The result is the **_RSA component_**.

    * (3) However, if the sum of the *RSA component and the *FHSA component (if any) is more than the *RSA provider's taxable income:

      * (a) the provider's taxable income is equal to that sum; and

      * (b) this Act applies to the provider as if it had a *tax loss for the income year of an amount that would have been that loss if the RSA component and the FHSA component (if any) were not *ordinary income or *statutory income.

    * (4) The **_standard component_** is the remaining part (if any) of the *RSA provider's taxable income for the income year after subtracting the *RSA component and the *FHSA component (if any).

      * (c) either:

        * (i) the entitlement, so far as it relates to the old RSA, is met wholly or partly by the making of a payment to another RSA (the **_new RSA_**) that the person is the holder of (whether or not the new RSA was established under section 16AH of the _Banking Act 1959_); or

        * (ii) a liquidator of the ADI pays a distribution from the liquidation of the ADI, so far as the distribution is attributable to the old RSA, to another RSA (also the **_new RSA_**) that the person is the holder of (whether or not the new RSA was established under section 16AR of the _Banking Act 1959_).

    * (2) This Part (except this section), and the other provisions of this Act (except this section) so far as they relate to this Part, apply in relation to the payment to the new RSA as if:

      * (a) the payment were made from the old RSA to the new RSA; and

      * (b) the entity that made the payment (rather than the *ADI) were the *RSA provider of the old RSA.

          * Note: The effects of this include:

##### 3071  What this Division is about

    * This Division defines concepts used in Divisions 301 to 306, such as **_superannuation benefit_****,** and the **_tax free component_** and **_taxable component _**of such benefits. To work out those components, it is often necessary to work out the corresponding components of the **_superannuation interest _**from which the benefit is paid (see Subdivision 307D).

    * This Division also defines the **_element taxed in the fund_** and the **_element untaxed in the fund_** of superannuation benefits, which are relevant to superannuation benefits paid from untaxed funds etc. (see Subdivision 307D).

    * Subdivision 307F defines the concessional limits used in Division 301 known as the low rate cap amount and untaxed plan cap amount.

##### 3075  What is a superannuation benefit?

    * (1) A **_superannuation benefit_** is a payment described in the table.

    * (2) A **_superannuation member benefit _**is a payment described in column 2 of the table.

    * (3) A *superannuation benefit is also a **_superannuation member benefit _**if:

      * (a) the superannuation benefit arises from the commutation of a *superannuation income stream; and

      * (b) it would be a *superannuation death benefit apart from this subsection; and

      * (c) the benefit is paid after the latest of the following:

        * (i) 6 months after the death of the deceased person; 

        * (ii) 3 months after the grant of probate of that deceased person's will or letters of administration of that deceased person's estate;

        * (iii) if the payment of the benefit is delayed because of legal action about entitlement to the benefit--6 months after the legal action ceases;

        * (iv) if the payment of the benefit is delayed because of reasonable delays in the process of identifying and making initial contact with potential recipients of the benefit--6 months after that process is completed; and

      * (d) the Commissioner has _not_ made a decision about the benefit under subsection (3A).

    * (3A) For the purposes of paragraph (3)(d), the Commissioner may make a decision in writing that the superannuation benefit is _not_ a **_superannuation member benefit_** under subsection (3), if:

      * (a) both of these conditions are satisfied:

        * (i) the payment of the benefit is delayed because of legal action about entitlement to the benefit;

        * (ii) the benefit is paid more than 6 months after the legal action ceases; or

      * (b) both of these conditions are satisfied:

        * (i) the payment of the benefit is delayed because of reasonable delays in the process of identifying and making initial contact with potential recipients of the benefit;

        * (ii) the benefit is paid more than 6 months after that process is completed.

    * (3B) In making a decision under subsection (3A), the Commissioner must have regard to the following matters:

      * (a) whether there was any action taken to try to pay the benefit within the 6 months after the cessation of the legal action or the completion of the process, and if so, the nature of that action;

      * (b) whether there were any factors beyond the control of the entity that paid the benefit, or of the person to whom the benefit was paid, that prevented the payment of the benefit within those 6 months;

      * (c) the circumstances of the person to whom the benefit was paid, and the actions of that person in relation to the benefit.

    * (4) A **_superannuation death benefit _**is a payment described in column 3 of the table.

    * (5) Subsection (6) applies if a *contributionssplitting superannuation benefit or a *family law superannuation payment is paid to you because another person is a member of a *superannuation fund, holder of an *RSA or depositor with an *approved deposit fund, or the annuitant under a *superannuation annuity.

    * (6) For the purposes of this section (and despite section 30715):

      * (a) treat yourself as a member of the fund, holder of the *RSA, depositor with the fund or annuitant under the *superannuation annuity; and

      * (b) do not treat the other person as a member of the fund, holder of the RSA, depositor with the fund or annuitant under the superannuation annuity.

          * Note: This means that the benefit is a superannuation benefit for you but not for the other person.

    * **_	_**(7)	A **_family law superannuation payment _**is a payment that:

      * (a) is a payment of any of the following kinds:

        * (iv) a payment in accordance with Part 4A of the _Retirement Savings Accounts Regulations 1997_;

        * (v) a payment specified in the regulations; and

      * (b) satisfies the requirements (if any) specified in the regulations.

    * Treatment of amounts transferred within a superannuation plan

    * (8) If an amount is transferred from one *superannuation interest in a *superannuation plan to another superannuation interest in the same plan, treat the transfer as a payment in determining whether the transfer of the amount is a superannuation benefit or a rollover superannuation benefit.

##### 30710  Payments that are not superannuation benefits

    * A payment of any of the following kinds is _not_ a **_superannuation benefit_**:

      * (a) an amount payable to a person under an income stream because of the person's temporary inability to engage in *gainful employment;

      * (aa) a benefit to which subsection 26AF(1) or 26AFA(1) of the _Income Tax Assessment Act 1936_ applies;

      * (ab) an amount required by the _Bankruptcy Act 1966 _to be paid to a trustee;

##### 30715  Payments for your benefit or at your direction or request

    * (1) This section applies for the purposes of:

      * (a) determining whether a payment is a **_superannuation benefit_**; and

      * (b) determining whether a *superannuation benefit is made to you, or received by you.

    * (2) A payment is treated as being made to you, or received by you, if it is made:

      * (a) for your benefit; or

      * (b) to another person or to an entity at your direction or request.

          * Note: Paragraph (b) would cover, for example, a direction by you that a payment be rolled over from your original superannuation fund into another superannuation fund.

##### 307120  Components of superannuation benefit

    * (1) Work out the following components of a *superannuation benefit under this Subdivision:

      * (a) the **_tax free component_**;

      * (b) the **_taxable component_**.

    * (2) Work out those components under:

      * (a) if the benefit is not mentioned in paragraph (b), (c), (d) or (e)--section 307125; or

      * (b) if the benefit is a *superannuation guarantee payment--section 307130; or

      * (c) if the benefit is a *superannuation cocontribution benefit payment--section 307135; or

      * (d) if the benefit is a *contributionssplitting superannuation benefit--section 307140; or

      * (e) if the benefit is a payment under subsection 17(2), (2AB) or (2AC), 20H(2), (2AA), (2A) or (3) or 24G(2), (3A) or (3B) of the _Superannuation (Unclaimed Money and Lost Members) Act 1999_--section 307142.

    * (3) Those components may be modified under sections 307145 (which deals with certain disability benefits) and 307150 (which deals with certain *elements untaxed in fund).

##### 307125  Proportioning rule

    * (1) The object of this section is to ensure that the *tax free component and *taxable component of a *superannuation benefit are calculated by:

      * (a) first, determining the proportions of the *value of the *superannuation interest that those components represent; and

      * (b) next, applying those proportions to the benefit.

    * (2) The *superannuation benefit is taken to be paid in a way such that each of those components of the benefit bears the same proportion to the amount of the benefit that the corresponding component of the *superannuation interest bears to the *value of the superannuation interest.

          * Example: The amount of a superannuation lump sum is $100. Just before the benefit is paid, the value of the superannuation interest was $1000 (of which $200 was the tax free component and $800 was the taxable component). For the lump sum, the tax free component is $20 and the taxable component is $80.

    * (3) For the purposes of subsection (2), determine the *value of the *superannuation interest, and the amount of each of those components of the interest, at whichever of the following times is applicable:

      * (a) if the *superannuation benefit is a *superannuation income stream benefit--when the relevant *superannuation income stream commenced;

      * (b) if the superannuation benefit is a *superannuation lump sum--just before the benefit is paid;

      * (c) despite paragraphs (a) and (b), if the superannuation benefit arises from the commutation of a superannuation income stream--when the relevant *superannuation income stream commenced.

    * (4) Subsection (2) does not apply to a *superannuation benefit if any of the following applies:

      * (a) the regulations specify an alternative method for determining those components of the benefit;

      * (b) a determination under subsection (5) specifies an alternative method for determining those components of the benefit;

      * (c) the Commissioner consents in writing to the use of another method for determining those components of the benefit.

    * If so, use that method to determine those components of the benefit.

    * (5) For the purposes of paragraph (4)(b), the Commissioner may determine, by legislative instrument, one or more alternative methods for determining those components of a *superannuation benefit.

    * (6) If the *superannuation benefit is an *unclaimed money payment or a *small superannuation account payment, for the purposes of this section:

      * (a) treat the benefit as a superannuation benefit paid from a *superannuation interest; and

      * (b) treat the amount of the benefit as the *value of that superannuation interest just before the time the benefit is paid.

##### 307130  Superannuation guarantee payment consists entirely of taxable component

    * The components of a *superannuation benefit that is a *superannuation guarantee payment are as follows:

      * (a) the *tax free component is nil;

      * (b) the *taxable component is the amount of the benefit.

##### 307135  Superannuation cocontribution benefit payment consists entirely of tax free component

    * The components of a *superannuation benefit that is a *superannuation cocontribution benefit payment are as follows:

      * (a) the *tax free component is the amount of the benefit;

      * (b) the *taxable component is nil.

##### 307140  Contributionssplitting superannuation benefit consists entirely of taxable component

    * The components of a *superannuation benefit that is a *contributionssplitting superannuation benefit are as follows:

      * (a) the *tax free component is nil;

      * (b) the *taxable component is the amount of the benefit.

##### 307142  Components of certain unclaimed money payments

    * Preliminary

    * (1) This section explains how to work out the *tax free component, and the *taxable component, of a *superannuation benefit that is a payment by the Commissioner under subsection 17(2), (2AB) or (2AC), 20H(2), (2AA), (2A) or (3) or 24G(2), (3A) or (3B) of the _Superannuation (Unclaimed Money and Lost Members) Act 1999_, or by a State or Territory authority as mentioned in subsection 18(5) of that Act, in respect of a person.

    * Tax free component

    * (2) Work out the *tax free component as follows (unless subsection (3B) or (3C) applies):

Method statement

        * Step 1.	Work out the amount (the **_unclaimed amount_**) (or amounts), set out in column 1 of the table in subsection (3), to which the *superannuation benefit is attributable.

             * Note: A payment made under subsection 17(2) of the _Superannuation (Unclaimed Money and Lost Members) Act 1999_ is attributable to a single unclaimed amount set out in item 1 or 2 of the table.

             * A payment under subsection 20H(2) or (3) of that Act may be attributable to more than one unclaimed amount.

             * A payment made under subsection 24G(2) of that Act is attributable to a single unclaimed amount set out in item 4 of the table.

        * Step 2.	Assume that the unclaimed amount (or each unclaimed amount), instead of being paid to the Commissioner, had been paid to the person as the payment (the **_claimed equivalent_**) set out in column 2 of the table.

        * Step 3.	The *tax free component of the *superannuation benefit consists of so much of the superannuation benefit as is attributable to the amount set out in column 3 of the table for the claimed equivalent (or as is attributable to the amounts set out in that column for the claimed equivalents).

    * (3) This is the table mentioned in subsection (2):

          * Note 1: Section 65AA of the _Superannuation Guarantee (Administration) Act 1992_ requires certain shortfall components to be treated as amounts paid to the Commissioner under subsection 20F(1) of the _Superannuation (Unclaimed Money and Lost Members) Act 1999_.

          * The effect of excluding such shortfall components from item 3 of the table in this subsection is that the taxable component includes so much of the superannuation benefit as is attributable to such a shortfall component.

          * Note 2: The table in this subsection does not cover interest paid by the Commissioner under subsection 20H(2A) of the _Superannuation (Unclaimed Money and Lost Members) Act 1999_.

          * The effect of this is that the taxable component includes so much of the superannuation benefit as is attributable to such interest.

    * (3A) Treat the amount set out in column 3 of an item of the table in subsection (3) as being nil, if:

      * (a) the unclaimed amount set out in column 1 of the item is an amount paid to the Commissioner by a State or Territory authority (within the meaning of the _Superannuation (Unclaimed Money and Lost Members) Act 1999_) in the circumstances mentioned in section 18AA, 20JA or 24HA of that Act; and

      * (b) the Commissioner does not have sufficient information to work out the amount set out in column 3 of the item.

    * (3B) The *tax free component is the amount of the benefit, if the *superannuation benefit is paid under subsection 17(2AB) or (2AC), 20H(2AA) or 24G(3A) or (3B) of the _Superannuation (Unclaimed Money and Lost Members) Act 1999_ (interest).

    * (3C) Despite subsection (3B), the *tax free component is nil, if the *superannuation benefit is paid under subsection 20H(2AA) of the _Superannuation (Unclaimed Money and Lost Members) Act 1999_ (interest) in respect of a person who:

      * (a) is a former temporary resident (within the meaning of that Act) when the payment is made; or

      * (b) if the person died before the payment is made--was a former temporary resident just before dying.

    * Taxable component

    * (4) The *taxable component is so much (if any) of the *superannuation benefit as is not the *tax free component.

##### 307145  Modification for disability benefits

    * (1) Work out the **_tax free component _**of the *superannuation benefit under subsection (2) if the benefit is a *superannuation lump sum and a *disability superannuation benefit.

          * Note: This section does not apply to an unclaimed money payment.

    * (2) The **_tax free component_** is the sum of:

      * (a) the *tax free component of the benefit worked out apart from this section; and

      * (b) the amount worked out under subsection (3).

    * However, the tax free component cannot exceed the amount of the benefit.

    * (3) Work out the amount by applying the following formula:

    * where: 

    * **_days to retirement_** is the number of days from the day on which the person stopped being capable of being *gainfully employed to his or her *last retirement day.

    * **_service days _**is the number of days in the *service period for the lump sum.

    * (4) The balance of the *superannuation benefit is the **_taxable component _**of the benefit.

##### 307150  Modification in respect of superannuation lump sum with element untaxed in fund

    * (1) This section applies to a *superannuation lump sum if:

      * (a) it is not a *rollover superannuation benefit; or

      * (b) it is a rollover superannuation benefit that includes an *element untaxed in the fund, all or part of which will be included in the assessable income of the *superannuation provider in relation to the *superannuation fund into which the benefit is paid.

    * (2) However, this section applies to the *superannuation lump sum only to the extent that it is attributable to a *superannuation interest that existed just before 1 July 2007.

    * (3) If the *superannuation lump sum includes an *element untaxed in the fund:

      * (a) increase the *tax free component of the benefit by the amount that is the lesser of these amounts:

        * (i) the amount worked out under subsection (4); and

        * (ii) the amount of the element untaxed in the fund (apart from this section); and

      * (b) reduce the element untaxed in the fund by the lesser of those amounts.

    * (4) Work out the amount by applying the following formula:

    * where: 

    * **_original tax free component and untaxed element _**is the sum of:

      * (a) the *tax free component of the *superannuation benefit (apart from this section); and

      * (b) the *element untaxed in the fund of the superannuation benefit (apart from this section).

    * (5) If the benefit is in part attributable to a *crystallised preJuly 83 amount, in working out the *tax free component of the *superannuation benefit (apart from this section) for the purposes of subsection (4), disregard the amount of the benefit that is attributable to the *crystallised segment of the *superannuation interest from which the benefit is paid.

##### 307200  Regulations relating to meaning of superannuation interests

    * (1) In the circumstances specified in the regulations, treat a **_superannuation interest_** as two or more superannuation interests in the way specified in the regulations.

    * (2) In the circumstances specified in the regulations, treat 2 or more **_superannuation interests_** as one superannuation interest in the way specified in the regulations.

    * (3) Regulations for the purposes of this section may specify a way of treating a *superannuation interest in relation to one or more of the following aspects of the interest:

      * (a) the *tax free component (and the *contributions segment and *crystallised segment relating to that component);

      * (b) the *taxable component;

      * (c) the *element taxed in the fund of the taxable component;

      * (d) the *element untaxed in the fund of the taxable component.

    * (4) Regulations for the purposes of subsection (1) may specify a way of allocating an amount relating to a *superannuation interest treated as two or more superannuation interests in accordance with those regulations to those interests.

    * (5) Subsections (3) and (4) do not limit the regulations that may be made for the purposes of this section.

##### 307205  Value of superannuation interest

    * The **_value _**of a *superannuation interest at a particular time is:

      * (a) if the regulations specify a method for determining the value of the superannuation interest--that value; or

      * (b) otherwise--the total amount of all the *superannuation lump sums that could be payable from the interest at that time.

##### 307210  Tax free component of superannuation interest

    * The **_tax free component _**of a *superannuation interest is so much of the *value of the interest as consists of:

      * (a) the *contributions segment of the interest; and

      * (b) the *crystallised segment of the interest.

          * Note: If superannuation benefits have been paid from the superannuation interest, the amount of the tax free component of the interest will be reduced by the tax free components of those superannuation benefits: see section 307125.

##### 307215  Taxable component of superannuation interest

    * The **_taxable component _**of a *superannuation interest is the *value of the interest less the *tax free component of the interest.

##### 307220  What is the contributions segment?

    * (1) The **_contributions segment _**of a *superannuation interest is so much of the *value of the interest as consists of contributions made after 30 June 2007, to the extent that they have not been and will not be included in the assessable income of the *superannuation provider in relation to the *superannuation plan in which the interest is held.

    * (2) For the purposes of this section:

      * (a) in determining whether contributions are included in the contributions segment under subsection (1):

        * (i) disregard the *taxable component of a *rollover superannuation benefit paid into the interest; and

        * (ii) for a *superannuation plan that is a *constitutionally protected fund--treat the superannuation plan as if it were not a constitutionally protected fund; and

      * (b) disregard section 295180 and Subdivision 295D.

    * (3) For the purposes of subparagraph (2)(a)(i), treat the *excess untaxed rollover amount (if any) of the *rollover superannuation benefit as part of the *tax free component of the benefit instead of the *taxable component of the benefit.

    * (4) Subparagraph (2)(a)(i) does not apply to a *rollover superannuation benefit that is a *departing Australia superannuation payment made under subsection 20H(2), (2AA) or (2A) of the _Superannuation (Unclaimed Money and Lost Members) Act 1999_.

          * Note 1: The whole departing Australia superannuation payment is included in the contributions segment of the superannuation interest, as none of the payment has been or will be included in the superannuation provider's assessable income.

          * Note 2: Including the whole payment in that segment, and thus the tax free component, of the superannuation interest ensures that the amount of the payment, which is taxed by the _Superannuation (Departing Australia Superannuation Payments Tax) Act 2007_, does not attract more tax when paid as a superannuation benefit from the interest.

##### 307225  What is the crystallised segment?

    * (1) To work out the **_crystallised segment _**of a *superannuation interest, first assume that:

      * (a) an eligible termination payment had been made in respect of the holder of the interest just before 1 July 2007; and

      * (b) the amount of the eligible termination payment had been equal to the *value of the interest at that time.

    * (2) The **_crystallised segment _**of the *superannuation interest is so much of the *value of the interest as consists of the total of the following components of the eligible termination payment:

      * (a) the concessional component;

      * (b) the postJune 1994 invalidity component;

      * (c) the undeducted contributions;

##### 307290  Taxed and untaxed elements of death benefit superannuation lump sums

    * (1) This section applies to a *superannuation death benefit that is a *superannuation lump sum, in relation to which a deduction has been, or is to be, claimed under section 295465 or 295470.

          * Note 1: Those sections allow deductions for insurance premiums that have been paid, and for liability for future benefits.

          * Note 2: Deductions made under former section 279 or 279B of the _Income Tax Assessment Act 1936_ are treated for the purposes of this section as having been made under section 295465 or 295470 (see section 307290 of the _Income Tax (Transitional Provisions) Act 1997_).

    * (2) The *taxable component of the *superannuation lump sum includes an **_element taxed in the fund _**worked out as follows:

      * (a) first, work out the amount under the formula in subsection (3);

      * (b) next, reduce that amount (but not below zero) by the *tax free component (if any) of the superannuation lump sum.

    * (3) For the purposes of paragraph (2)(a), the formula is:

    * **_days to retirement_** is the number of days from the day on which the deceased died to the deceased's *last retirement day.

    * **_service days _**is the number of days in the *service period for the lump sum.

    * (4) The **_element untaxed in the fund _**of the *taxable component is the balance of the taxable component.

##### 307295  Superannuation benefits from public sector superannuation schemes may include untaxed element

    * (1) This section applies to a *superannuation benefit that is paid from a *public sector superannuation scheme that is not a *constitutionally protected fund.

    * (2) If the *superannuation benefit paid is not sourced to any extent from contributions made into a *superannuation fund or earnings on such contributions, the *taxable component of the superannuation benefit consists wholly of an**_ element untaxed in the fund_**.

    * (3) If the benefit is a *superannuation lump sum that is partly sourced from contributions made into a *superannuation fund or earnings on such contributions, the **_element taxed in the fund _**and the **_element untaxed in the fund _**of the *taxable component of the benefit are worked out as follows:

        * _Method statement_

        * _Step 1.	Subdivide the *taxable component of the *superannuation lump sum (the **_original benefit_**) into 2 notional superannuation lump sums as follows:

          * (a) the amount sourced from contributions made into a *superannuation fund or earnings on such contributions (the **_fund benefit_**);

          * (b) the remainder of the taxable component of the lump sum (the **_nonfund benefit_**).

        * Step 2.	The fund benefit consists of an **_element taxed in the fund_**, an **_element untaxed in the fund_**, or both, as worked out under this Subdivision.

        * Step 3.	The nonfund benefit consists wholly of an **_element untaxed in the fund_**.

        * Step 4.	The **_element taxed in the fund _**of the original benefit equals the element taxed in the fund of the fund benefit.

        * Step 5.	The **_element untaxed in the fund _**of the original benefit is the sum of the elements untaxed in the fund worked out under steps 2 and 3.

##### 307297  Public sector superannuation schemes--elements set by regulations

    * (1) This section applies to a *superannuation benefit that is paid from a *public sector superannuation scheme that is not a *constitutionally protected fund.

    * (2) Despite any other provision of this Subdivision, the *taxable component of the *superannuation benefit consists of an **_element untaxed in the fund_** equal to the amount (if any) specified by the regulations in relation to the benefit for the purposes of this section.

    * (3) The amount specified must not be less than the amount that would be the *element untaxed in the fund under the other provisions of this Subdivision.

##### 307300  Certain unclaimed money payments

    * Preliminary

    * (1) This section explains how to work out the *element taxed in the fund, and the *element untaxed in the fund, of the *taxable component of a *superannuation benefit that is a payment by the Commissioner under subsection 17(2), 20H(2), (2AA), (2A) or (3) or 24G(2) of the _Superannuation (Unclaimed Money and Lost Members) Act 1999_.

    * Element taxed in the fund

    * (2) Work out the **_element taxed in the fund_** as follows (unless subsection (3A) applies):

Method statement

        * Step 1.	Work out the amount (the **_unclaimed amount_**) (or amounts), set out in column 1 of the table in subsection (3), to which the *taxable component is attributable.

             * Note: A payment made under subsection 17(2) of the _Superannuation (Unclaimed Money and Lost Members) Act 1999_ is attributable to a single unclaimed amount set out in item 1 or 2 of the table.

             * A payment under subsection 20H(2) or (3) of that Act may be attributable to more than one unclaimed amount.

             * A payment made under subsection 24G(2) of that Act is attributable to a single unclaimed amount set out in item 4 of the table.

        * Step 2.	Assume that the unclaimed amount (or each unclaimed amount), instead of being paid to the Commissioner, had been paid to the person as the payment (the **_claimed equivalent_**) set out in column 2 of the table.

        * Step 3.	The **_element taxed in the fund_** of the *taxable component consists of so much of the taxable component as is attributable to the amount set out in column 3 of the table for the claimed equivalent (or as is attributable to the amounts set out in that column for the claimed equivalents).

    * (3) This is the table mentioned in subsection (2):

          * Note 1: Section 65AA of the _Superannuation Guarantee (Administration) Act 1992_ requires certain shortfall components to be treated as amounts paid to the Commissioner under subsection 20F(1) of the _Superannuation (Unclaimed Money and Lost Members) Act 1999_.

          * The effect of excluding such shortfall components from item 3 of the table in this subsection is that the element untaxed in the fund includes so much of the superannuation benefit as is attributable to such a shortfall component.

          * Note 2: The table in this subsection does not cover interest paid by the Commissioner under subsection 20H(2A) of the _Superannuation (Unclaimed Money and Lost Members) Act 1999_.

          * The effect of this is that the element untaxed in the fund of the taxable component includes so much of the superannuation benefit as is attributable to such interest.

    * (3A) The **_element taxed in the fund_** is nil, if the *superannuation benefit is paid under subsection 20H(2AA) of the _Superannuation (Unclaimed Money and Lost Members) Act 1999_ (interest).

          * Note: The taxable component of a superannuation benefit paid by the Commissioner under subsection 17(2AB) or (2AC) or 24G(3A) or (3B) of the _Superannuation (Unclaimed Money and Lost Members) Act 1999_, or under subsection 20H(2AA) in respect of a person who is not a former temporary resident, is nil: see subsections 307142(3B) and (4) of this Act.

    * Element untaxed in the fund

    * (4) The **_element untaxed in the fund_** of the *taxable component is so much (if any) of the taxable component as is not the element taxed in the fund.

        * (ii) includes an *element untaxed in the fund.

    * (2) Reduce your **_untaxed plan cap amount_** just after that time:

      * (a) if the total of the *elements untaxed in the fund of the *superannuation member benefits to which paragraph (1A)(b) applies falls short of your untaxed plan cap amount at that time--by that total; or

      * (b) otherwise--to nil.

    * (2A) For the purposes of subsections (1A) and (2), disregard subsection 3075(8).

    * (2B) For the purposes of the application of this section in relation to *superannuation lump sums paid by the Commissioner under subsections 17(2), 20H(2), (2AA), (2A) and (3) and 24G(2) of the _Superannuation (Unclaimed Money and Lost Members) Act 1999_, treat all such lump sums as if they were paid from a single *superannuation plan.

    * (3) At the start of each income year after the 20072008 income year, increase your **_untaxed plan cap amount_** for the *superannuation plan by the amount (if any) by which the index amount for that income year exceeds the index amount for the previous income year.

    * (4) For the purposes of subsection (3), the index amount for the 20072008 income year is $1,000,000. The index amount is then indexed annually.

          * Note: Subdivision 960M shows how to index amounts. However, annual indexation does not necessarily increase the index amount: see section 960285.
