       * (i) of the holding company or of a creditor of the holding company; or

       * (ii) if the holding company is being wound up--of the liquidator;

      * that the number of meetings that would be required between creditors in order to consider the proposed compromises or arrangements would be so great as to result in a significant impediment to the timely and effective consideration by those creditors of the terms of the compromises or arrangements;

     * the Court may order a meeting or meetings, on a consolidated basis, of the creditors of the holding company and of each of the subsidiaries or of such class or classes of those creditors as the Court determines and, where the Court makes such an order, the Court may approve the explanatory statement required by paragraph 412(1)(a) to accompany notices of the meeting or meetings.

     * (1B) Where:

      * (a) there are fewer than 30 whollyowned subsidiaries of the holding company but the matters referred to in paragraphs (1A)(b) and (c) are satisfied; and

     * (1) Except so far as the contrary intention appears in this Part or Part 11.2, this Part applies in relation to a receiver of property of a corporation who is appointed after 1 January 1991, even if the appointment arose out of a transaction entered into, or an act or thing done, before 1 January 1991.

     * (2) To avoid doubt, this Part does not apply, of its own force, to the property of a corporation that is an Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander corporation.

         * Note 1: The definition of **_property_** in section 416 does not define that term in relation to a corporation that is an Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander corporation.

         * Note 2: Section 5161 of the _Corporations (Aboriginal and  Islander) Act 2006_ applies this Part to a corporation that is an Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander corporation with the modifications provided for in that section.

##### 418  Persons not to act as receivers

     * (1) A person is not qualified to be appointed, and must not act, as receiver of property of a corporation if the person:

      * (a) is a secured party in relation to any property (including PPSA retention of title property) of the corporation; or

      * (b) is an auditor or a director, secretary, senior manager or employee of the corporation; or

      * (c) is a director, secretary, senior manager or employee of a body corporate that is a secured party in relation to any property (including PPSA retention of title property) of the corporation; or

      * (d) is not a registered liquidator; or

      * (f) unless ASIC directs in writing that this paragraph does not apply in relation to the person in relation to the corporation--has at any time within the last 12 months been a director, secretary, senior manager, employee or promoter of the corporation or of a related body corporate.

     * (3) Paragraph (1)(d) does not apply in relation to a body corporate authorised by or under a law of the Commonwealth, of a State or of a Territory to act as receiver of property of the corporation concerned.

##### 418A  Court may declare whether controller is validly acting

     * (1) Where there is doubt, on a specific ground, about:

      * (a) whether a purported appointment of a person, after 23 June 1993, as receiver of property of a corporation is valid; or

      * (b) whether a person who has entered into possession, or assumed control, of property of a corporation after 23 June 1993 did so validly under the terms of a security interest in that property;

     * the person, the corporation or any of the corporation's creditors may apply to the Court for an order under subsection (2).

     * (2) On an application, the Court may make an order declaring whether or not:

      * (a) the purported appointment was valid; or

      * (b) the person entered into possession, or assumed control, validly under the terms of the security interest;

     * as the case may be, on the ground specified in the application or on some other ground.

##### 419  Liability of controller

     * (1) A receiver, or any other authorised person, who, whether as agent for the corporation concerned or not, enters into possession or assumes control of any property of a corporation for the purpose of enforcing any security interest is, notwithstanding any agreement to the contrary, but without prejudice to the person's rights against the corporation or any other person, liable for debts incurred by the person in the course of the receivership, possession or control for services rendered, goods purchased or property hired, leased (including a lease of goods that gives rise to a PPSA security interest in the goods), used or occupied.

     * (2) Subsection (1) does not constitute the person entitled to the security interest a mortgagee in possession.

     * (3) Where:

      * (a) a person (in this subsection called the **_controller_**) enters into possession or assumes control of property of a corporation; and

      * (b) the controller purports to have been properly appointed as a receiver in respect of that property under a power contained in an instrument, but has not been properly so appointed; and

      * (c) civil proceedings in an Australian court arise out of an act alleged to have been done by the controller;

     * the court may, if it is satisfied that the controller believed on reasonable grounds that the controller had been properly so appointed, order that:

      * (d) the controller be relieved in whole or in part of a liability that the controller has incurred but would not have incurred if the controller had been properly so appointed; and

      * (e) a person who purported to appoint the controller as receiver be liable in respect of an act, matter or thing in so far as the controller has been relieved under paragraph (d) of liability in respect of that act, matter or thing.

##### 419A  Liability of controller under preexisting agreement about property used by corporation

     * (1) This section applies if:

      * (a) under an agreement made before the control day in relation to a controller of property of a corporation, the corporation continues after that day to use or occupy, or to be in possession of, property (**_the third party property_**) of which someone else is the owner or lessor; and

      * (b) the controller is controller of the third party property.

     * (2) Subject to subsections (4) and (7), the controller is liable for so much of the rent or other amounts payable by the corporation under the agreement as is attributable to a period:

      * (a) that begins more than 7 days after the control day; and

      * (b) throughout which:

       * (i) the corporation continues to use or occupy, or to be in possession of, the third party property; and

       * (ii) the controller is controller of the third party property.

     * (3) Within 7 days after the control day, the controller may give to the owner or lessor a notice that specifies the third party property and states that the controller does not propose to exercise rights in relation to that property as controller of the property, whether on behalf of the corporation or anyone else.

     * (4) Despite subsection (2), the controller is not liable for so much of the rent or other amounts payable by the corporation under the agreement as is attributable to a period during which a notice under subsection (3) is in force, but such a notice does not affect a liability of the corporation.

     * (5) A notice under subsection (3) ceases to have effect if:

      * (a) the controller revokes it by writing given to the owner or lessor; or

      * (b) the controller exercises, or purports to exercise, a right in relation to the third party property as controller of the property, whether on behalf of the corporation or anyone else.

     * (6) For the purposes of subsection (5), the controller does not exercise, or purport to exercise, a right as mentioned in paragraph (5)(b) merely because the controller continues to be in possession, or to have control, of the third party property, unless the controller:

      * (a) also uses the property; or

      * (b) asserts a right, as against the owner or lessor, so to continue.

     * (7) Subsection (2) does not apply in so far as a court, by order, excuses the controller from liability, but an order does not affect a liability of the corporation.

     * (8) The controller is not taken because of subsection (2):

      * (a) to have adopted the agreement; or

      * (b) to be liable under the agreement otherwise than as mentioned in subsection (2).

##### 420  Powers of receiver

     * (1) Subject to this section, a receiver of property of a corporation has power to do, in Australia and elsewhere, all things necessary or convenient to be done for or in connection with, or as incidental to, the attainment of the objectives for which the receiver was appointed.

     * (2) Without limiting the generality of subsection (1), but subject to any provision of the court order by which, or the instrument under which, the receiver was appointed, being a provision that limits the receiver's powers in any way, a receiver of property of a corporation has, in addition to any powers conferred by that order or instrument, as the case may be, or by any other law, power, for the purpose of attaining the objectives for which the receiver was appointed:

      * (a) to enter into possession and take control of property of the corporation in accordance with the terms of that order or instrument; and

      * (b) to lease, let on hire or dispose of property of the corporation; and

      * (c) to grant options over property of the corporation on such conditions as the receiver thinks fit; and

      * (d) to borrow money on the security of property of the corporation; and

      * (e) to insure property of the corporation; and

      * (f) to repair, renew or enlarge property of the corporation; and

      * (h) to carry on any business of the corporation; and

      * (j) to take on lease or on hire, or to acquire, any property necessary or convenient in connection with the carrying on of a business of the corporation; and

      * (k) to execute any document, bring or defend any proceedings or do any other act or thing in the name of and on behalf of the corporation; and

      * (m) to draw, accept, make and indorse a bill of exchange or promissory note; and

      * (n) to use a seal of the corporation; and

      * (o) to engage or discharge employees on behalf of the corporation; and

      * (p) to appoint a solicitor, accountant or other professionally qualified person to assist the receiver; and

      * (q) to appoint an agent to do any business that the receiver is unable to do, or that it is unreasonable to expect the receiver to do, in person; and

      * (r) where a debt or liability is owed to the corporation--to prove the debt or liability in a bankruptcy, insolvency or winding up and, in connection therewith, to receive dividends and to assent to a proposal for a composition or a scheme of arrangement; and

      * (s) if the receiver was appointed under an instrument that created a security interest in uncalled share capital of the corporation:

       * _	_(i)	to make a call in the name of the corporation for the payment of money unpaid on the corporation's shares; or

       * _	_(ii)	on giving a proper indemnity to a liquidator of the corporation--to make a call in the liquidator's name for the payment of money unpaid on the corporation's shares; and

      * (t) to enforce payment of any call that is due and unpaid, whether the calls were made by the receiver or otherwise; and

      * (u) to make or defend an application for the winding up of the corporation; and

      * (w) to refer to arbitration any question affecting the corporation.

     * (3) The conferring by this section on a receiver of powers in relation to property of a corporation does not affect any rights in relation to that property of any other person other than the corporation.

     * (4) In this section, a reference, in relation to a receiver, to property of a corporation is, unless the contrary intention appears, a reference to the property of the corporation in relation to which the receiver was appointed.

     * (5) In this section:

     * **_lease _**includes a lease of goods that gives rise to a PPSA security interest in the goods.

##### 420A  Controller's duty of care in exercising power of sale

     * (1) In exercising a power of sale in respect of property of a corporation, a controller must take all reasonable care to sell the property for:

      * (a) if, when it is sold, it has a market value--not less than that market value; or

      * (b) otherwise--the best price that is reasonably obtainable, having regard to the circumstances existing when the property is sold.

     * (2) Nothing in subsection (1) limits the generality of anything in section 180, 181, 182, 183 or 184.

##### 420B  Court may authorise managing controller to dispose of property despite prior security interest

     * (1) On the application of a managing controller of property of a corporation, the Court may by order authorise the controller to sell, or to dispose of in some other specified way, specified property of the corporation, even though it is subject to a security interest (the **_prior security interest_**) that has priority over a security interest (the **_controller's security interest_**) in that property that the controller is enforcing.

     * (2) However, the Court may only make an order if satisfied that:

      * (a) apart from the existence of the prior security interest, the controller would have power to sell, or to so dispose of, the property; and

      * (b) the controller has taken all reasonable steps to obtain the consent of the secured party in relation to the prior security interest to the sale or disposal, but has not obtained that consent; and

      * (c) sale or disposal of the property under the order is in the best interests of the corporation's creditors and of the corporation; and

      * (d) sale or disposal of the property under the order will not unreasonably prejudice the rights or interests of the secured party in relation to the prior security interest.

     * (3) The Court is to have regard to the need to protect adequately the rights and interests of the secured party in relation to the prior security interest.

     * (4) If the property would be sold or disposed of together with other property that is subject to the controller's security interest, the Court may have regard to:

      * (a) the amount (if any) by which it is reasonable to expect that the net proceeds of selling or disposing of that other property otherwise than together with the firstmentioned property would be less than so much of the net proceeds of selling or disposing of all the property together as would be attributable to that other property; and

      * (b) the amount (if any) by which it is reasonable to expect that the net proceeds of selling or disposing of the firstmentioned property otherwise than together with the other property would be greater than so much of the net proceeds of selling or disposing of all the property together as would be attributable to the firstmentioned property.

     * (5) Nothing in subsection (3) or (4) limits the matters to which the Court may have regard for the purposes of subsection (2).

     * (6) An order may be made subject to conditions, for example (but without limitation):

      * (a) a condition that:

       * (i) the net proceeds of the sale or disposal; and

       * (ii) the net proceeds of the sale or disposal of such other property (if any) as is specified in the condition and is subject to the controller's security interest;

      * or a specified part of those net proceeds, be applied in payment of specified amounts secured by the prior security interest; or

      * (b) a condition that the controller apply a specified amount in payment of specified amounts secured by the prior security interest.

##### 420C  Receiver's power to carry on corporation's business during winding up

     * (1) A receiver of property of a corporation that is being wound up may:

      * (a) with the written approval of the corporation's liquidator or with the approval of the Court, carry on the corporation's business either generally or as otherwise specified in the approval; and

      * (b) do whatever is necessarily incidental to carrying on that business under paragraph (a).

     * (2) Subsection (1) does not:

      * (a) affect a power that the receiver has otherwise than under that subsection; or

      * (b) empower the receiver to do an act that he or she would not have power to do if the corporation were not being wound up.

     * (3) A receiver of property of a corporation who carries on the corporation's business under subsection (1) does so:

      * (a) as agent for the corporation; and

      * (b) in his or her capacity as receiver of property of the corporation.

     * (4) The consequences of subsection (3) include, but are not limited to, the following:

      * (a) for the purposes of subsection 419(1), a debt that the receiver incurs in carrying on the business as mentioned in subsection (3) of this section is incurred in the course of the receivership;

      * (b) a debt or liability that the receiver incurs in so carrying on the business is not a cost, charge or expense of the winding up.

     * (4) If, in the managing controller's opinion, it would seriously prejudice:

     * except with the leave of the Court and in accordance with such terms (if any) as the Court imposes.

     * (2) While subsection (1) prevents a person (**_the creditor_**) from:

      * (a) enforcing as against another person (**_the guarantor_**) a guarantee of a liability of a company; or

      * (b) beginning a proceeding against another person (**_the guarantor_**) in relation to such a guarantee;

##### Subdivision C--Property not subject to security interests

##### 441EB  Scope of Subdivision

     * This Subdivision does not apply in relation to the enforcement of a right, or the performance or exercise of a function or power, if the enforcement, performance or exercise is authorised by (or because of) a transaction or dealing that gives rise to a security interest in the property concerned.

Such a transaction gives rise to a PPSA security interest because of section 12 of the _Personal Property Securities Act 2009_. The consigned property is PPSA retention of title property of the company (see sections 51F and 435B).

         * Note: Subdivision B (property subject to security interests) may apply in relation to transactions or dealings to which this Subdivision does not apply because of this section. For example, Subdivision B would apply in relation to a commercial consignment of personal property, because such a transaction gives rise to a PPSA security interest.

##### 442B  Dealing with property subject to circulating security interests

     * Scope

     * (1) This section applies if a security interest in property (the **_secured property_**) of a company under administration was a circulating security interest when the interest arose, but has stopped being a circulating security interest because:

      * (a) in the case of a PPSA security interest--the property has stopped being a circulating asset (within the meaning of the _Personal Property Securities Act 2009_); or

      * (b) in the case of a security interest that was a floating charge when it arose--the floating charge has since become a fixed or specific charge.

         * Note 1: A **_circulating security interest_** can be either a PPSA security interest to which a circulating asset has attached, or a floating charge, in the circumstances set out in section 51C.

         * Note 2: For the meaning of **_circulating asset_**, see section 340 of the _Personal Property Securities Act 2009_.

     * Security interest in circulating asset

     * (2) Subject to sections 442C and 442D, in the case of a PPSA security interest, the administrator may deal with any of the secured property in any way the company could deal with the secured property immediately before it stopped being a circulating asset.

     * Floating charge

     * (3) Subject to sections 442C and 442D, in the case of a security interest that was a floating charge when it arose, the administrator may deal with any of the secured property as if the security interest were still a floating charge.

         * Note: Section 442C deals with the disposal of encumbered property by an administrator. Section 442D makes the administrator's functions and powers subject to those of a secured party, receiver or controller.

##### 442C  When administrator may dispose of encumbered property

     * (1) The administrator of a company under administration or of a deed of company arrangement must not dispose of:

      * (a) property of the company that is subject to a security interest; or

      * (b) property (other than PPSA retention of title property) that is used or occupied by, or is in the possession of, the company but of which someone else is the owner or lessor.

         * Note: PPSA retention of title property is subject to a PPSA security interest, and so is covered by paragraph (a) (see definition of **_PPSA retention of title property_** in section 51F).

     * (2) Subsection (1) does not prevent a disposal:

      * (a) in the ordinary course of the company's business; or

      * (b) with the written consent of the secured party, owner or lessor, as the case may be; or

      * (c) with the leave of the Court.

     * (3) The Court may only give leave under paragraph (2)(c) if satisfied that arrangements have been made to protect adequately the interests of the secured party, owner or lessor, as the case may be.

     * (4) If the administrator proposes to dispose of property of the company under paragraph (2)(a), the Court may, by order, direct the administrator not to carry out that proposal.

     * (5) The Court may only make an order under subsection (4) on the application of:

      * (a) if paragraph (1)(a) applies--the secured party; or

      * (b) if paragraph (1)(b) applies--the owner or lessor, as the case may be.

     * (6) The Court may only make an order under subsection (4) if it is not satisfied that arrangements have been made to protect adequately the interests of the applicant for the order.

     * (7) If:

      * (a) a company is under administration or is subject to a deed of company arrangement; and

      * (b) property of the company is subject to a security interest; and

      * (c) the administrator disposes of the property;

     * the disposal extinguishes the security interest.

     * (8) For the purposes of paragraph (2)(a), if:

      * (a) property is used or occupied by, or is in the possession of, a company; and

      * (b) another person is the owner of the property; and

      * (c) either:

       * (i) the property is PPSA retention of title property; or

       * (ii) the property is subject to a retention of title clause under a contract; and

      * (d) the owner demands the return of the property;

     * a disposal of the property that occurs after the demand is made does not mean that the disposal is not in the ordinary course of the company's business.

##### 442CA  Property subject to a possessory security interest--inspection or examination by potential purchasers etc.

     * (1) If:

      * (a) a company is under administration; and

      * (b) property of the company is subject to a possessory security interest; and

      * (c) the administrator is entitled to dispose of the property by way of sale;

     * the secured party must, if requested to do so by the administrator, give potential purchasers a reasonable opportunity to inspect or examine the property.

     * (2) If:

      * (a) a company is under administration; and

      * (b) property of the company is subject to a possessory security interest; and

      * (c) the administrator disposes of the property by way of sale;

     * the administrator is entitled to obtain possession of the property in order to effect the sale.

##### 442CB  Property subject to a security interest or to a retention of title clause--administrator's duty of care in exercising power of sale

     * (1) If the administrator of a company is entitled to dispose of property of the company by way of sale, and the property is subject to a security interest, the administrator must act reasonably in exercising a power of sale in respect of the property.

         * Note: A company's property includes its PPSA retention of title property (see the definition of **_property_** applying to Part 5.3A, in section 435B).

     * (2) If:

      * (a) a company is under administration; and

      * (c) another person is the owner of the property; and

      * (d) the property is subject to a retention of title clause under a contract; and

      * (e) the administrator is entitled to dispose of the property by way of sale;

     * then, in exercising a power of sale in respect of the property, the administrator must act reasonably.

     * (3) Subsections (1) and (2) do not limit section 180, 181, 182, 183 or 184.

      * (a) a company is under administration; and

      * (b) property of the company is subject to a possessory security interest; and

      * (c) the administrator disposes of the property by way of sale;

     * then: 

      * (d) if the net proceeds of sale equals or exceeds the total of the debts secured by:

       * (i) the possessory security interest; and

       * (ii) any other security interest in the property, where the debt secured by the security interest has a priority that is equal to or higher than the priority of the debt secured by the possessory security interest;

      * the administrator must: 

       * (iii) set aside so much of the net proceeds as equals the total of those debts; and

       * (iv) apply the amount so set aside in paying those debts; or

      * (e) if the net proceeds of sale fall short of the total of the debts secured by:

       * (i) the possessory security interest; and

       * (ii) any other security interest in the property, where the debt secured by the security interest has a priority that is equal to or higher than the priority of the debt secured by the possessory security interest;

      * then: 

       * (iii) the administrator must set aside the net proceeds; and

       * (iv) the administrator must apply the amount so set aside in paying those debts in order of priority, on the basis that if the amount is insufficient to fully pay debts of the same priority, they must be paid proportionately; and

       * (v) if any of those debts is not fully paid--so much of the debt as remains unpaid may be recovered from the company as an unsecured debt.

     * PPSA retention of title property

     * (1A) If the administrator of a company disposes of PPSA retention of title property of the company by way of sale, then the administrator must apply the net proceeds of the sale in the same way as a secured party is required, under section 140 of the _Personal Property Securities Act 2009_, to apply an amount, personal property or proceeds of collateral received by the secured party as a result of enforcing a security interest in the property.

         * Note: PPSA retention of title property does not include property that is subject to a retention of title clause (see section 9, definitions of **_PPSA retention of title property_** and **_retention of title clause_**). Subsection (2) deals with property that is subject to a retention of title clause.

     * Property subject to a retention of title clause

     * (2) If:

      * (a) a company is under administration; and

      * (b) property is used or occupied by, or is in the possession of, the company; and

      * (d) the property is subject to a retention of title clause under a contract (the **_original contract_**); and

      * (e) the administrator disposes of the property by way of sale;

     * then: 

      * (f) if the net proceeds of sale equals or exceeds the total of:

       * (i) so much of the purchase price, or other amount, under the original contract as remains unpaid; and

       * (ii) if there are one or more securities over the property--the debts secured by the securities;

      * the administrator must: 

       * (iii) set aside so much of the net proceeds as equals that total; and

       * (iv) apply the amount so set aside in paying that total; or

      * (g) if the net proceeds of sale fall short of the total of:

       * (i) so much of the purchase price, or other amount, under the original contract as remains unpaid; and

       * (ii) if there are one or more securities over the property--the debts secured by the securities;

      * then: 

       * (iii) the administrator must set aside the net proceeds; and

       * (iv) the administrator must apply the amount so set aside in paying those debts in order of priority, on the basis that if the amount is insufficient to fully pay debts of the same priority, they must be paid proportionately; and

       * (v) if any of those debts is not fully paid--so much of the debt as remains unpaid may be recovered from the company as an unsecured debt.

         * Note: Property that is subject to a retention of title clause does not include PPSA retention of title property (see section 9, definitions of **_PPSA retention of title property_** and **_retention of title clause_**). Subsection (1A) deals with PPSA retention of title property.

##### 442D  Administrator's powers subject to powers of secured party, receiver or controller

     * (1) Where section 441A applies, the administrator's functions and powers are subject to the functions and powers of a person as:

      * (a) the secured party; or

      * (b) a receiver or controller appointed under Part 5.2 (whether under an instrument relating to the security interest or a court order, and even if appointed after the decision period).

     * (2) Where section 441C applies, then, so far as concerns perishable property of the company, the administrator's functions and powers are subject to the functions and powers of a person as:

      * (a) the secured party; or

      * (b) a receiver or controller appointed under Part 5.2 (whether under an instrument relating to the security interest or a court order, and even if appointed after the decision period).

     * (3) Where section 441B, 441F or 441G applies, then, so far as concerns the property referred to in subsection 441B(1), 441F(1) or 441G(1), the administrator's functions and powers are subject to the functions and powers of the secured party, receiver or controller.

##### 442E  Administrator has qualified privilege

     * A person who is or has been the administrator of a company under administration has qualified privilege in respect of a statement that he or she has made, whether orally or in writing, in the course of performing or exercising any of his or her functions and powers as administrator of the company.

##### 442F  Protection of persons dealing with administrator

     * (1) Sections 128 and 129 apply in relation to a company under administration as if:

      * (a) a reference in those sections to the company, or to an officer of the company, included a reference to the administrator; and

      * (b) a reference in those sections to an assumption referred to in section 129 included a reference to an assumption that the administrator is:

       * (i) acting within his or her functions and powers as administrator; and

       * (ii) in particular, is complying with this Act.

     * (2) Subject to subsection (4), if the amount received, after deducting expenses of or incidental to getting in that amount, equals or exceeds the total of all the amounts that are payable by the company under relevant contracts of insurance, the liquidator must, out of the amount received and in priority to all payments in respect of the debts mentioned in section 556, pay the amounts that are so payable under those contracts of insurance.

     * (3) Subject to subsection (4), if subsection (2) does not apply, the liquidator must, out of the amount received and in priority to all payments in respect of the debts mentioned in section 556, pay to each person to whom an amount is payable by the company under a relevant contract of insurance an amount calculated in accordance with the formula:

     * (5) The matters that the Court may take into account in considering whether to make an order under subsection (4) include, but are not limited to:

      * (a) whether it is possible to identify particular relevant contracts of insurance as being the contracts in respect of which the contract of reinsurance was entered into; and

      * (b) whether it is possible to identify persons who can be said to have paid extra in order to have particular relevant contracts of insurance protected by reinsurance; and

      * (c) whether particular relevant contracts of insurance include statements to the effect that the contracts are to be protected by reinsurance; and

      * (d) whether a person to whom an amount is payable under a relevant contract of insurance would be severely prejudiced if subsections (2) and (3) applied to the amount received under the contract of reinsurance.

     * (6) If receipt of a payment under this section only partially discharges a liability of the company to a person, nothing in this section affects the rights of the person in respect of the balance of the liability.

     * (7) This section has effect despite any agreement to the contrary.

     * (8) In this section:

     * **_relevant contract of insurance_** means a contract of insurance entered into by the company, as insurer, before the relevant date.

##### 563AAA  Redemption of debentures

     * Priorities

##### 568A  Liquidator must give notice of disclaimer

     * (1) As soon as practicable after disclaiming property, a liquidator must:

      * (a) lodge a written notice of the disclaimer; and

      * (b) give written notice of the disclaimer to each person who appears to the liquidator to have, or to claim to have, an interest in the property; and

      * (d) if a law of the Commonwealth or of a State or Territory requires the transfer or transmission of the property to be registered--give written notice of the disclaimer to the registrar or other person who has the function under that law of registering the transfer or transmission of the property.

      * (a) if the liquidator gives to the person notice of the disclaimer, because of paragraph 568A(1)(b), before the end of 14 days after the liquidator lodges such notice--the liquidator gives such notice to the person; or

      * (b) if paragraph (a) does not apply but notice of the disclaimer is published under subsection 568A(2) before the end of the 14 days referred to in that paragraph--the last such notice to be so published is so published; or

      * (c) otherwise--the liquidator lodges notice of the disclaimer.

     * (2) On an application under subsection (1), the Court:

      * (a) may by order set aside the disclaimer; and

      * (b) if it does so--may make such further orders as it thinks appropriate.

     * (3) However, the Court may set aside a disclaimer under this section only if satisfied that the disclaimer would cause, to persons who have, or claim to have, interests in the property, prejudice that is grossly out of proportion to the prejudice that setting aside the disclaimer would cause to the company's creditors.

##### 568C  When disclaimer takes effect

     * (1) A disclaimer takes effect if, and only if:

      * (a) in a case where only one application under section 568B for an order setting aside the disclaimer, or each of 2 or more such applications, is made within the period that that section prescribes for making the application--the application, or each of the applications, is unsuccessful; or

      * (b) no such application is so made.

     * (2) For the purposes of subsection (1), an application under section 568B is successful if, and only if, the result of the application, and all appeals (if any) arising out of the application, being finally determined or otherwise disposed of is an order setting aside the disclaimer (whether or not further orders are also made).

     * (3) A disclaimer that takes effect because of subsection (1) is taken to have taken effect on the day after:

       * (ii) notice of the disclaimer was published under subsection 568A(2);

      * before the end of 14 days after the liquidator lodged notice of the disclaimer--the last day when the liquidator so gave such notice or such notice was so published; or

      * (b) otherwise--the day when the liquidator lodged notice of the disclaimer.

##### 568D  Effect of disclaimer

     * (1) A disclaimer is taken to have terminated, as from the day on which it is taken because of subsection 568C(3) to take effect, the company's rights, interests, liabilities and property in or in respect of the disclaimer property, but does not affect any other person's rights or liabilities except so far as necessary in order to release the company and its property from liability.

     * (2) A person aggrieved by the operation of a disclaimer is taken to be a creditor of the company to the extent of any loss suffered by the person because of the disclaimer and may prove such a loss as a debt in the winding up.

##### 568E  Application to set aside disclaimer after it has taken effect

     * (1) With the leave of the Court, a person who has, or claims to have, an interest in disclaimed property may apply to the Court for an order setting aside the disclaimer after it has taken effect.

     * (3) The Court may give leave subject to conditions.

     * (4) On an application under subsection (1), the Court:

      * (a) may by order set aside the disclaimer; and

     * (5) However, the Court may set aside a disclaimer only if satisfied that the disclaimer has caused, or would cause, to persons who have, or claim to have, interests in the property, prejudice that is grossly out of proportion to the prejudice that setting aside the disclaimer (and making any further orders) would cause to:

      * (a) the company's creditors; and

      * (b) persons who have changed their position in reliance on the disclaimer taking effect.

##### 568F  Court may dispose of disclaimed property

     * (1) The Court may order that disclaimed property vest in, or be delivered to:

      * (c) a person as trustee for a person of a kind referred to in paragraph (a) or (b).

     * (2) The Court may make an order under subsection (1):

      * (a) on the application of a person who claims an interest in the property, or is under a liability in respect of the property that this Act has not discharged; and

     * (4) If the transaction is a voidable transaction solely because it is an unreasonable directorrelated transaction, the court may make orders under subsection (1) only for the purpose of recovering for the benefit of the creditors of the company the difference between:

         * Note 4: The _Personal Property Securities Act 2009_ provides for perfection by registration, possession or control, or by force of that Act (see section 21 of that Act).

     * Vesting of security interest in company

     * (4) The PPSA security interest vests in the company at the following time, unless the security interest is unaffected by this section because of section 588FN:

     * (7) In this section:

     * **_critical time_**, in relation to a company, means:

      * (a) if the company is being wound up--when, on a day, the event occurs by virtue of which the winding up is taken to have begun or commenced on that day under section 513A or 513B; or

     * (2) On an application under this section, the Court may make the order sought if it is satisfied that:

      * (a) the failure to register the collateral earlier:

       * (i) was accidental or due to inadvertence or some other sufficient cause; or

       * (ii) is not of such a nature as to prejudice the position of creditors or shareholders; or

      * (b) on other grounds, it is just and equitable to grant relief.

### Part 5.8A--Employee entitlements

##### 596AA  Object and coverage of Part

     * Object

     * (1) The object of this Part is to protect the entitlements of a company's employees from agreements and transactions that are entered into with the intention of defeating the recovery of those entitlements.

     * Employee entitlements

     * (2) The **_entitlements_** of an employee of a company that are protected under this Part are:

      * (a) wages payable by the company for services rendered to the company by the employee; and

      * (b) superannuation contributions (that is, contributions by the company to a fund or scheme for the purposes of making provision for, or obtaining, superannuation benefits (including defined benefits) for the employee, or for dependants of the employee) payable by the company in respect of services rendered to the company by the employee; and

      * (c) amounts due in respect of injury compensation in relation to the employee; and

      * (d) amounts due under an industrial instrument in respect of the employee's leave of absence; and

      * (e) retrenchment payments for the employee (that is, amounts payable by the company to the employee, under an industrial instrument, in respect of the termination of the employee's employment by the company).

     * An entitlement of an employee need not be owed to the employee. It might, for example, be an amount owed to the employee's dependants or a superannuation contribution payable to a fund in respect of services rendered by the employee.

     * (3) The entitlements of an excluded employee (within the meaning of section 556) are protected under this Part only to the extent to which they have priority under paragraph 556(1)(e), (f), (g) or (h).

     * Employees

     * (4) For the purposes of this Part, a person is an **_employee_** of a company if the person is, or has been, an employee of the company (whether remunerated by salary, wages, commission or otherwise).

     * (5) If an entitlement of an employee of a company is owed to a person other than the employee, this Part applies to the entitlement as if a reference to the **_employee_** included a reference to the person to whom the entitlement is owed.

##### 596AB  Entering into agreements or transactions to avoid employee entitlements

     * (1) A person must not enter into a relevant agreement or a transaction with the intention of, or with intentions that include the intention of:

      * (a) preventing the recovery of the entitlements of employees of a company; or

      * (b) significantly reducing the amount of the entitlements of employees of a company that can be recovered.

     * (2) Subsection (1) applies even if:

      * (a) the company is not a party to the agreement or transaction; or

      * (b) the agreement or transaction is approved by a court.

     * (3) A reference in this section to a **_relevant agreement or a transaction_** includes a reference to:

      * (a) a relevant agreement and a transaction; and

      * (b) a series or combination of:

       * (i) relevant agreements or transactions; or

       * (ii) relevant agreements; or

       * (iii) transactions.

     * (4) If a person contravenes this section by incurring a debt (within the meaning of section 588G), the incurring of the debt and the contravention are **_linked_** for the purposes of this Act.

##### 596AC  Person who contravenes section 596AB liable to compensate for loss

     * (1) A person is liable to pay compensation under subsection (2) or (3) if:

      * (c) the employees suffer loss or damage because of:

       * (i) the contravention; or

       * (ii) action taken to give effect to an agreement or transaction involved in the contravention.

     * The person is liable whether or not the person has been convicted of an offence in relation to the contravention.

     * (2) The company's liquidator may recover from the person an amount equal to the loss or damage as a debt due to the company.

         * Note: Because employee entitlements are priority payments under paragraphs 556(1)(e) to (h), employees have priority to any compensation recovered by the liquidator in proceedings brought under this section.

     * (3) If an employee of the company has suffered loss or damage because of:

      * (a) the contravention; or

      * (b) action taken to give effect to an agreement or transaction involved in the contravention;

     * the employee may, as provided in section 596AF to 596AI (but not otherwise), recover from the person, as a debt due to the employee, an amount equal to the amount of the loss or damage. Any amount recovered by the employee under this subsection is to be taken into account in working out the amount for which the employee may prove in the liquidation of the company.

     * (4) Proceedings under this section may only be begun within 6 years after the beginning of the winding up.

##### 596AD  Avoiding double recovery

     * An amount recovered in proceedings under section 596AC in relation to a contravention of section 596AB is to be taken into account in working out the amount (if any) recoverable in:

      * (a) any other proceedings under that section in relation to the contravention; and

      * (b) proceedings under section 588M in relation to the incurring of a debt that is linked to the contravention.

##### 596AE  Effect of section 596AC

      * (b) does not prevent proceedings from being instituted in respect of a breach of such a duty or in respect of such a liability.

     * (1) If a company is being wound up, an employee of the company may, with the written consent of the company's liquidator, begin proceedings under section 596AC in relation to a contravention of section 596AB in relation to an entitlement of the employee.

     * (2) Subsection (1) has effect despite section 596AH, but subject to section 596AI.

##### 596AG  Employee may give liquidator notice of intention to sue for compensation

     * An employee of a company that is being wound up may give the company's liquidator a written notice:

      * (b) specifying the contravention of section 596AB and the entitlement to which the proposed proceedings relate; and

       * (ii) a written statement of the reasons why the liquidator thinks that proceedings under section 596AC in relation to the contravention should not be begun.

     * The notice may be given only after the end of 6 months beginning when the company begins to be wound up.

##### 596AH  When employee may sue for compensation without liquidator's consent

     * (1) This section applies if an employee of a company gives a notice under section 596AG in relation to a contravention of section 569AB and to an entitlement.

     * (2) The employee may begin proceedings in a court under section 596AC in relation to the contravention and the entitlement if:

      * (a) as at the end of 3 months after the liquidator receives the notice, he or she has not consented to the employee beginning such proceedings; and

      * (b) on an application made after those 3 months, the court has given leave for the proceedings to begin.

     * (3) If:

     * then: 

      * (c) the employee must file the statement with the court when so applying; and

##### 596AI  Events preventing employee from suing

     * (1) An employee of a company that is being wound up cannot begin proceedings under section 596AC in relation to a contravention in relation to an entitlement of the employee if:

      * (a) the company's liquidator has applied under section 588FF in relation to a transaction that constituted, or was part of, the contravention; or

      * (b) the company's liquidator has begun proceedings under section 596AC in relation to the contravention; or

     * Trust property vests in the Commonwealth

     * (1A) On deregistration, all property that the company held on trust immediately before deregistration vests in the Commonwealth. If property is vested in a liquidator on trust immediately before deregistration, that property vests in the Commonwealth. This subsection extends to property situated outside this jurisdiction.

     * Other company property vests in ASIC

     * (2) On deregistration, all the company's property (other than any property held by the company on trust) vests in ASIC.

This subsection extends to property situated outside this jurisdiction.

     * Rights and powers in respect of property

     * (3) Under subsection (1A) or (2), the Commonwealth or ASIC takes only the same property rights that the company itself held. If the company held particular property subject to a security or other interest or claim, the Commonwealth or ASIC takes the property subject to that interest or claim.

     * (3A) The Commonwealth has, subject to its obligations as trustee of the trust, all the powers of an owner over property vested in it under subsection (1A).

         * Note: Section 601AF confers additional powers on the Commonwealth to fulfil outstanding obligations of the deregistered company.

     * (4) ASIC has all the powers of an owner over property vested in it under subsection (2).

         * Note: Section 601AF confers additional powers on ASIC to fulfil outstanding obligations of the deregistered company.

     * Company books to be kept by former directors

     * (5) The directors of the company immediately before deregistration must keep the company's books for 3 years after the deregistration. 

     * (6) Subsection (5) does not apply to books that a liquidator has to keep under subsection 542(2).

         * Note: A defendant bears an evidential burden in relation to the matter in subsection (6), see subsection 13.3(3) of the _Criminal Code_.

     * Strict liability offences

     * (7) An offence based on subsection (5) is an offence of strict liability.

         * Note: For **_strict liability_**, see section 6.1 of the _Criminal Code_.

##### 601AE  What the Commonwealth or ASIC does with the property

     * Trust property vested in the Commonwealth

     * (1) If property vests in the Commonwealth under subsection 601AD(1A), the Commonwealth may:

      * (a) continue to act as trustee; or

      * (b) apply to a court for the appointment of a new trustee.

         * Note: Under paragraph (1)(a), the Commonwealth may be able to transfer the property to a new trustee chosen in accordance with the trust instrument.

     * (1A) If the Commonwealth continues to act as trustee in respect of the property, subject to its obligations as trustee, the Commonwealth:

      * (a) in the case of money--must credit the amount of the money to a special account (within the meaning of the _Public Governance, Performance and Accountability Act 2013_); or

      * (b) otherwise:

       * (i) may sell or dispose of the property as it thinks fit; and

       * (ii) if the Commonwealth does so--must credit the amount of the proceeds to a special account (within the meaning of the _Public Governance, Performance and Accountability Act 2013_).

         * Note: ASIC may, for and on behalf of the Commonwealth, perform all the duties and exercise all the powers of the Commonwealth as trustee in relation to property held on trust by the Commonwealth (see subsection 8(6) of the ASIC Act).

     * Property vested in ASIC

     * (2) If property vests in ASIC under subsection 601AD(2), ASIC may:

      * (a) dispose of or deal with the property as it sees fit; and

      * (b) apply any money it receives to:

       * (i) defray expenses incurred by ASIC in exercising its powers in relation to the company under this Chapter; and

       * (ii) make payments authorised by subsection (3).

     * ASIC must deal with the rest (if any) under Part 9.7.

     * Obligations attaching to property vested in the Commonwealth

     * (2A) For the purposes of subsection (3), if any liability is imposed on property under a law of the Commonwealth immediately before the property vests in the Commonwealth under subsection 601AD(1A), then:

      * (a) immediately after that time, the liability applies to the Commonwealth as if the Commonwealth were a body corporate; and

      * (b) the Commonwealth is liable to make notional payments to discharge that liability.

     * Obligations attaching to property

     * (3) Any property that vests in the Commonwealth or ASIC under subsection 601AD(1A) or (2) remains subject to all liabilities imposed on the property under a law and does not have the benefit of any exemption that the property might otherwise have because it is vested in the Commonwealth or ASIC. These liabilities include a liability that:

      * (a) is a security interest in or claim on the property; and

      * (b) arises under a law that imposes rates, taxes or other charges.

     * Extent of Commonwealth's and ASIC's obligation

     * (4) The Commonwealth's or ASIC's obligation under subsection (2A) or (3) is limited to satisfying the liabilities out of the company's property to the extent that the property is properly available to satisfy those liabilities.

     * Accounts

     * (5) The Commonwealth or ASIC (as the case requires) must keep:

      * (a) a record of property that it knows is vested in it under this Chapter; and

      * (b) a record of its dealings with that property; and

      * (c) accounts of all money received from those dealings; and

      * (d) all accounts, vouchers, receipts and papers relating to the property and that money.

##### 601AF  The Commonwealth's and ASIC's power to fulfil outstanding obligations of deregistered company

     * The Commonwealth or ASIC may do an act on behalf of the company or its liquidator if the Commonwealth or ASIC is satisfied that the company or liquidator would be bound to do the act if the company still existed.

         * Note: This power is a general one and is not limited to acts in relation to property vested in the Commonwealth under subsection 601AD(1A), or ASIC under subsection 601AD(2). The Commonwealth or ASIC has all the powers that automatically flow from the vesting of property under that subsection (see subsections 601AD(3A) and (4)) and may exercise those powers whether or not the company was bound to do so.

##### 601AG  Claims against insurers of deregistered company

     * A person may recover from the insurer of a company that is deregistered an amount that was payable to the company under the insurance contract if: 

      * (a) the company had a liability to the person; and

      * (b) the insurance contract covered that liability immediately before deregistration.

##### 601AH  Reinstatement

     * Reinstatement by ASIC

     * (1) ASIC may reinstate the registration of a company if ASIC is satisfied that the company should not have been deregistered.

     * Reinstatement by Court

     * (2) The Court may make an order that ASIC reinstate the registration of a company if:

      * (a) an application for reinstatement is made to the Court by:

       * (i) a person aggrieved by the deregistration; or

       * (ii) a former liquidator of the company; and

      * (b) the Court is satisfied that it is just that the company's registration be reinstated.

     * (3) If:

      * (a) ASIC reinstates the registration of a company under subsection (1); or

      * (b) the Court makes an order under subsection (2);

     * the Court may: 

      * (c) validate anything done during the period:

       * (i) beginning when the company was deregistered; and

       * (ii) ending when the company's registration was reinstated; and

      * (d) make any other order it considers appropriate.

         * Note: For example, the Court may direct ASIC to transfer to another person property vested in ASIC under subsection 601AD(2).

     * ASIC to give notice of reinstatement

     * (4) ASIC must give notice of a reinstatement in the _Gazette_. If ASIC exercises its power under subsection (1) in response to an application by a person, ASIC must also give notice of the reinstatement to the applicant.

     * Effect of reinstatement

     * (5) If a company is reinstated, the company is taken to have continued in existence as if it had not been deregistered. A person who was a director of the company immediately before deregistration becomes a director again as from the time when ASIC or the Court reinstates the company. Any property of the company that is still vested in the Commonwealth or ASIC revests in the company. If the company held particular property subject to a security or other interest or claim, the company takes the property subject to that interest or claim.
