  * 1**  Short title **[_see_ Note 1]

  * This Act may be cited as the _Commonwealth Authorities (Northern Territory Pay-roll Tax) Act 1979_.

##### 2  Commencement

  * This Act shall be deemed to have come into operation on 1 July 1978.

##### 3  Interpretation

  * (1) In this Act:

  * **_Commonwealth authority_** means an authority or body constituted or established by an Act.

  * **_Commonwealth authority subject to pay-roll tax_** means a Commonwealth authority:

   * (a) that was registered as an employer under the former _Pay-roll Tax (Territories) Assessment Act 1971_ or in respect of which an application for registration as an employer under that Act was pending; or

   * (b) that was registered as an employer under the pay-roll tax law of a State or in respect of which an application for registration as an employer under the pay-roll tax law of a State was pending,

  * immediately before the commencement of this Act.

  * **_pay-roll tax law_**, in relation to the Commonwealth, a State or the Northern Territory, means a law of the Commonwealth, of the State or of the Northern Territory, as the case may be, that relates to the imposition, assessment and collection of a tax upon wages.

  * (2) For the purposes of this Act, an authority or body continued in existence by an Act shall be deemed to be constituted by that Act.

##### 4  Liability of Commonwealth authorities for Northern Territory pay-roll tax

  * (1) Where the Act that constitutes or establishes a Commonwealth authority, being a Commonwealth authority subject to pay-roll tax, contains provision:

   * (a) to the effect that the Commonwealth authority is not subject to taxation under a law of a State or Territory to which the Commonwealth is not subject; or 

   * (b) to the effect that the Commonwealth authority is not, except with respect to taxation of a kind specified in the Act, subject to taxation under a law of a State or Territory to which the Commonwealth is not subject, that provision does not have effect in relation to taxation under the pay-roll tax law of the Northern Territory.

  * (2) Where:

   * (a) the Act that constitutes or establishes a Commonwealth authority, being a Commonwealth authority subject to pay-roll tax, contains a provision (in this subsection referred to as the **_relevant provision_**) to the effect that:

    * (i) except under a law specified in regulations made under the Act, the Commonwealth authority is not, under a law of a State or Territory, subject to taxation, or is not, under a law of a State or Territory, subject to taxation other than taxation of a kind specified in the Act; or

    * (ii) except under a law specified in regulations made under the Act, the Commonwealth authority is not, under a law of the Commonwealth or of a State or Territory, subject to taxation, or is not, under a law of the Commonwealth or of a State or Territory, subject to taxation other than taxation of a kind specified in the Act; and

   * (b) immediately before the commencement of this Act, regulations under the Act made for the purposes of the relevant provision were in force specifying:

    * (i) in a case to which sub-paragraph (a)(i) applies--a pay-roll tax law of a State; or

    * (ii) in a case to which sub-paragraph (a)(ii) applies--a pay-roll tax law of the Commonwealth or of a State,

  * the relevant provision has effect as if the pay-roll tax law of the Northern Territory were also specified in regulations made under the Act for the purposes of the relevant provision.
