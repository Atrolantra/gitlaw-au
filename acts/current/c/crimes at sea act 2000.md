     * Responsibility for administering criminal justice in the area covered by the scheme will be divided between the Commonwealth and the States under the scheme and an intergovernmental agreement.

     * The purposes of this Act are: 

      * (a) to give legal force to the scheme (so far as it depends on the legislative power of the Commonwealth) and to provide for consequential vesting of judicial and other powers; and

##### 6  Application of Australian criminal law outside the adjacent area

     * it is a defence to prove: 

      * (c) that no corresponding offence exists under the law of the other country; or

### Part 2--Application of State criminal law to adjacent area

##### 2  Application of State criminal law in adjacent area

     * (1) The substantive criminal law of a State, as in force from time to time, applies, by force of the law of the State, throughout the inner adjacent area for the State.

     * (2) The provisions of the substantive criminal law of a State, as in force from time to time, apply, by force of the law of the Commonwealth, throughout the outer adjacent area for the State.

     * (3) However, this clause does not:

      * (a) apply to a substantive criminal law that is incapable of applying in an adjacent area or is limited by its express terms to a place within the area of a State; or

         * Example: A law making it an offence to drive a motor vehicle at a speed exceeding a prescribed limit on a road could not apply in an adjacent area because of the inherent localising elements of the offence. The scheme does not therefore purport to extend the application of such a law to the adjacent area. 

      * (b) give a legal effect to a provision of a substantive criminal law that the provision does not have within the area of the State.

         * Example: If the effect of a provision of the substantive criminal law of a State is limited under section 109 of the Constitution within the area of the State, the effect is similarly limited in the outer adjacent area for the State even though the provision applies in the outer adjacent area under the legislative authority of the Commonwealth.

##### 3  Application of laws of criminal investigation, procedure and evidence

     * (1) In this clause:

     * **_act_** includes an omission.

     * **_area of administrative responsibility_** for a particular State is:

      * (a) the area of the State; and

      * (b) the inner adjacent area for the State; and

      * (c) other parts of the adjacent area in which the State has, under the intergovernmental agreement, responsibility (which may be either exclusive or concurrent) for administering criminal justice.

     * **_authority_** includes an agent or official.

     * **_Commonwealth judicial proceeding_** means:

      * (a) a judicial proceeding related to a maritime offence:

       * (i) initiated by an authority of the Commonwealth; or

       * (ii) for the conduct of which an authority of the Commonwealth has assumed responsibility; or

      * (b) a judicial proceeding about an investigation, procedure or act by an authority of the Commonwealth in relation to a maritime offence.

     * **_judicial proceeding_** means:

      * (a) a proceeding in a court (whether between parties or not) or a proceeding incidental to or connected with a proceeding in a court; or

      * (b) the laying of a charge; or

      * (c) the preliminary examination of a charge of an indictable offence or a proceeding incidental to or connected with the preliminary examination of a charge of an indictable offence.

     * **_preliminary examination_** of a charge of an indictable offence means a proceeding to decide whether the defendant should be committed for trial or, if the defendant pleads guilty to the charge, to commit the defendant for sentence or trial.

     * **_State judicial proceeding_** means:

      * (a) a judicial proceeding related to a maritime offence:

       * (i) initiated by an authority of a State; or

       * (ii) for the conduct of which an authority of a State has assumed responsibility; or

      * (b) a judicial proceeding about an investigation, procedure or act by an authority of a State in relation to a maritime offence.

     * (2) The laws of criminal investigation, procedure and evidence of the Commonwealth and the States apply to maritime offences as follows:

      * (a) the law of the Commonwealth applies to investigations, procedures and acts (other than judicial proceedings) by authorities of the Commonwealth; and

      * (b) the law of a State applies to investigations, procedures and acts (other than judicial proceedings) by authorities of the State operating within the area of administrative responsibility for the relevant State; and

      * (c) in a Commonwealth judicial proceeding the law of the Commonwealth applies and in a State judicial proceeding the law of the State in which the proceeding was commenced applies (subject to the Constitution) irrespective of whether:

       * (i) the maritime offence arises under the law of the State in which the proceeding was commenced or another State; or

       * (ii) the substantive criminal law against which the offence was committed applies in the relevant part of the adjacent area under the law of the State in which the proceeding was commenced, another State or the Commonwealth.

        * Example 1: Suppose that a person is charged by a State authority with a maritime offence on the assumption that the offence was committed in the inner adjacent area for the State but the court is satisfied in the course of the proceedings that the acts alleged against the defendant took place in the outer adjacent area for the State. In this case, the court could continue with the proceedings under the procedural laws of the State. However, the court could not (for example) convict the defendant on the basis of a majority verdict of a jury (because to do so would be contrary to the Commonwealth Constitution--see_ Cheatle,_ 177 CLR 541).

        * Example 2: Suppose that a person is charged by a State authority in a South Australian court with a maritime offence alleged to have been committed in the adjacent area for . For the purposes of the proceedings, the offence would be classified as a major indictable, minor indictable or summary offence according to the South Australian rules and not by reference to its classification under the law of  or the Commonwealth.

     * (3) This clause operates to the exclusion of any Commonwealth or State law that is inconsistent with it.

     * (4) A Commonwealth or State law enacted or made after the commencement of this clause is to be construed as having effect subject to this clause, unless the law expressly overrides this clause.
