    * (b) to the effect that, except for taxation of a specified kind, the authority is not subject to taxation under a law of a State or Territory to which the Commonwealth is not subject.

   * (2) The provision does not have effect in relation to tax that is payable under the _Payroll Tax Act 1987_ of the Australian Capital Territory.

     * (ii) to the effect that, except under a law specified in regulations made under the Act, the authority is not subject to taxation under a law of the Commonwealth or of a State or Territory; or
