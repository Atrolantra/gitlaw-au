##### 6  Validation of acts

  * _Past acts_

  * _	(1)	For the purposes of this section, a **_past act_** is an act or thing that was done on the assumption that the _Coal Industry Repeal Act 2001_ had commenced on 1 January 2002.

  * _Validation by Commonwealth law_

  * _	(2)	To avoid doubt, past acts are as valid, and are taken always to have been as valid, as they would have been if the _Coal Industry Repeal Act 2001_ had commenced on 1 January 2002.

  * (3) Subsection (2) has effect to the extent to which it is not in excess of the legislative power of the Commonwealth.

    * Note: Paragraph 51(xx) of the Constitution deals with corporations.

  * (5) It is the intention of the Parliament that subsections (2), (3) and (4) are not to apply to the exclusion of a law of New South Wales to the extent that that law is capable of operating concurrently with those subsections.

  * _Validation by State law_

  * _	(6)	To avoid doubt, it is the intention of the Parliament that a law of New South Wales may provide that past acts are as valid, and are taken always to have been as valid, as they would have been if the _Coal Industry Repeal Act 2001_ had commenced on 1 January 2002.
