       * (iii) is or will hold a temporary visa that does not prohibit the seafarer from performing the work he or she performs on the vessel;

     * (c) a statement explaining what is preventing the vessel being registered under the _Shipping Registration Act 1981_, with reference to the following matters:

       * (i) financial, business or legal constraints;

       * (ii) what action is being, or will be, taken to register the vessel under the _Shipping Registration Act 1981_;

     * (b) a decision made by the Minister, in accordance with the old law, to cancel a continuing permit granted under section 286 of the old law.

##### Part 5--Miscellaneous

##### 18  Saving of orders

  * Despite the repeal of section 7 of the _Navigation Act 1912_, an order made under that section and in force immediately before commencement continues in force on and after commencement as if it were an exemption under subsection 11(1) of the new law.

##### 19  Saving of permissions

  * Despite the repeal of the old law by Schedule 1 to this Act, a permission granted under subsection 286(6) of the old law and in force immediately before commencement, continues in force on and after commencement for the remainder of the period set out in the notice mentioned in subsection 286(6) of the old law as if:

     * (a) the permission were a direction made under subsection 11(1) of the new law; and

     * (b) any conditions to which the permission was subject were conditions specified in the direction.

##### 20  Saving of exemptions

  * An exemption made under subsection 421(1) of the _Navigation Act 1912_ relating to the coasting trade and in force immediately before commencement continues in force on and after commencement as if it were an exemption in force under subsection 11(1) of the new law.

##### 21  Transitional regulations

     * (a) required or permitted by this Schedule to be prescribed; or
