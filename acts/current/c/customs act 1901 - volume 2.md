     * (c) whether the warrant authorises an ordinary search or a frisk search of a person who is at or near the premises when the warrant is executed, if the executing officer or a person assisting suspects on reasonable grounds that the person has in his or her possession any relevant evidential material.

    * (7) Paragraph (5)(d) and subsection (5A) do not prevent the issue of successive warrants in relation to the same premises.

    * (8) If the application for the warrant is made under section 203M, this section (other than subsection (5A)) applies as if:

     * (a) subsection (1) referred to 48 hours rather than 72 hours; and

    * (3) In determining whether goods produced in Australia are put, or are capable of being put, to a use corresponding to a use to which goods the subject of a TCO, or of an application for a TCO, can be put, it is irrelevant whether or not the firstmentioned goods compete with the secondmentioned goods in any market.
