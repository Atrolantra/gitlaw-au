##### 3  Objects

    * (1) This section sets out the objects of this Act.

    * Climate Change Convention and Kyoto Protocol etc.

    * (2) The first object of this Act is to remove greenhouse gases from the atmosphere, and avoid emissions of greenhouse gases, in order to meet Australia's obligations under any or all of the following:

     * (a) the Climate Change Convention;

     * (b) the Kyoto Protocol;

     * (c) an international agreement (if any) that is the successor (whether immediate or otherwise) to the Kyoto Protocol.

    * Incentives

    * (3) The second object of this Act is to create incentives for people to carry on certain offsets projects.

    * Carbon abatement

    * (4) The third object of this Act is to increase carbon abatement in a manner that:

     * (b) improves resilience to the effects of climate change.

    * Purchase of carbon abatement by the Commonwealth

    * (5) The fourth object of this Act is to authorise the purchase by the Commonwealth of units that represent carbon abatement.

##### 4  Simplified outline

    * The following is a simplified outline of this Act: 

     *  	This Act sets up a scheme for the issue of Australian carbon credit units in relation to eligible offsets projects.

     *  	Australian carbon credit units and certain other types of units may be purchased by the Commonwealth.

     *  	An Australian carbon credit unit is personal property and is generally transferable.

     *  	The main eligibility requirements for eligible offsets projects are as follows: 

        * (a) the project must be carried out in Australia;

        * (b) the project must be covered by a methodology determination made under this Act.

     *  	A methodology determination is made having regard to the offsets integrity standards set out in this Act.
