  * (1) In this Act:

  * **_body_** has the same meaning as in the Levy Act.

  * **_borrowing_** includes the raising of money by dealing in securities.

  * **_Levy Act_** means the _Commonwealth Borrowing Levy Act 1987_.

  * **_securities_** includes stocks, debentures, debenture stocks, notes, bonds, promissory notes, bills of exchange and similar instruments or documents.

  * (2) A reference in this Act to dealing with securities includes a reference to:

   * (a) creating, executing, entering into, drawing, making, accepting, endorsing, issuing, discounting, selling, purchasing or re-selling securities;

   * (b) creating, selling, purchasing or re-selling rights or options in respect of securities; and

   * (c) entering into agreements or other arrangements relating to securities.

  * (3) Subject to subsection (4):

   * (a) the issue by a body of an instrument acknowledging a debt in consideration of the payment or deposit of money or of the provision of credit; or

   * (b) the obtaining of credit by the body;

  * shall, for the purposes of this Act, be deemed to be a borrowing by the body to the extent of the amount of that money or of that credit, as the case may be.

  * (4) The issue of an instrument of the kind referred to in paragraph (3)(a), or the obtaining of credit, by a body other than a body referred to in item 5 or 14 of the Schedule to the Levy Act in relation to a transaction that is in the ordinary course of the day-to-day operations of the body shall be deemed not to be a borrowing by the body.

##### 4  Collection of levy

  * The Treasurer may, by legislative instrument:

   * (a) specify the times when and the manner in which the levy is to be paid; and

   * (b) require a specified officer of a body to provide the Treasurer, at specified times, with a statement certifying:

    * (i) the amount of the levy payable by the body at a specified time;

    * (ii) the amount of borrowings on which the amount of the levy was calculated; and

    * (iii) such other particulars of borrowings by the body relevant to the calculation of the levy as are specified in the determination.

##### 5  Regulations

##### 6  Repeal of Commonwealth Guarantees (Charges) Act

  * (1) The _Commonwealth Guarantees (Charges) Act 1987 _is repealed.

  * (2) In spite of the repeal of the _Commonwealth Guarantees (Charges) Act 1987_, that Act continues to apply to borrowings and raisings of money, within the meaning of that Act, undertaken before 1 July 1987 by a body referred to in the Schedule to that Act.

  * (3) In its application in accordance with subsection (2), the _Commonwealth Guarantees (Charges) Act 1987 _has effect as if Item 3 in Part A of the Schedule to that Act were omitted.
