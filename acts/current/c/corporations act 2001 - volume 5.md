      * (i) had or had not been complied with at a date or within a period specified in the certificate; or

      * (ii) had been complied with at a date specified in the certificate but not before that date;

     * is to be received as prima facie evidence of matters specified in the certificate; and

     * (c) a certificate by ASIC that, during a period specified in the certificate, a particular company was registered, or taken to be registered, under this Act is to be received as prima facie evidence that, during that period, that company was registered under this Act.

     * (a) all requirements of this Act for its registration have been complied with; and

     * (b) the company was duly registered as a company under this Act on the date specified in the certificate.

    * (8) If ASIC is of opinion that a document submitted for lodgment:

    * **_right _**includes an interest or status.

    * **_substituted right or liability_** has the meaning given by subsection 1400(2) or 1401(3).

    * **_this Part _**includes regulations made for the purposes of any of the provisions of this Part.

    * (2) Subject to subsection (4), for the purposes of this Part, a provision or part (the **_old provision or part_**) of the old corporations legislation of a State or Territory **_corresponds _**to a provision or part (the **_new provision or part_**) of the new corporations legislation (and vice versa) if:

     * (a) the old provision or part and the new provision or part are substantially the same, unless the regulations specify that the 2 provisions or parts do not correspond; or

     * (b) the regulations specify that the 2 provisions or parts correspond.

        * Note: The range of provisions of the new corporations legislation that may be corresponding provisions for the purposes of this Part is affected by sections 1401 and 1408, which take certain provisions of the old corporations legislation to be included in the new corporations legislation.

    * (3) For the purposes of paragraph (2)(a), differences of all or any of the following kinds are not sufficient to mean that 2 provisions or parts are not substantially the same:

     * (a) differences in the numbering of the provisions or parts;

     * (b) differences of a minor technical nature (for example, differences in punctuation, or differences that are attributable to the correction of incorrect cross references);

     * (c) the fact that one of the provisions refers to a corresponding previous law and the other does not;

     * (d) that fact that:

      * (i) the old provision or part allowed a court to exercise powers on its own motion but the new provision or part does not; or

      * (ii) the old provision or part required a court to apply a criterion of public interest but the new provision or part requires a court to apply a criterion of justice and equity; or

      * (iii) the new provision or part requires ASIC to take account of public interest but the old provision or part did not;

     * (e) other differences that are attributable to the fact that the new corporations legislation applies as a Commonwealth law throughout this jurisdiction;

     * (f) other differences of a kind prescribed by the regulations for the purposes of this paragraph.

    * This subsection is not intended to otherwise limit the circumstances in which 2 provisions or parts are, for the purposes of paragraph (2)(a), substantially the same.

    * (4) The regulations may provide that a specified provision of the old corporations legislation of a State or Territory does, or does not, correspond to a specified provision of the new corporations legislation.

##### 1372  Relationship of Part with State validation Acts

    * (1) This Part applies to an invalid administrative action of a Commonwealth authority or an officer of the Commonwealth (within the meaning of a State validation Act) as if the circumstances that made the authority's or officer's action an invalid administrative action had not made the action invalid.

        * Note 1: So, for example, in determining whether the purported registration of a company is an action to which this Part (in particular Division 2) applies, the circumstances that made the action an invalid administrative action for the purposes of a State validation Act are to be disregarded.

        * Note 2: For the status and effect of invalid administrative actions in relation to times before the commencement, see the State validation Acts.

    * (2) However, if there are other circumstances that affect or may affect the validity of the action, neither this section, nor anything else in this Part, is taken to negate the effect of those other circumstances.

    * (3) If:

     * (a) a person would have had a right or liability under a provision (the **_old provision_**) of the old corporations legislation of a State if the circumstances that made the authority's or officer's action an invalid administrative action (within the meaning of the State validation Act of that State) had not made the action invalid; and

     * (b) the effect of that State validation Act in relation to that action is to declare that the person has, and is taken always to have had, the same rights and liabilities as they would have had under the old provision if the invalid administrative action had been taken, or purportedly taken, at the relevant time by a duly authorised State authority or officer of the State (within the meaning of that Act);

    * this Part applies as if: 

     * (c) a reference to a right or liability arising under the old corporations legislation included a reference to the right or liability that the person is declared to have by the State validation Act; and

     * (d) that right or liability arose under the old provision.

    * (4) In this section:

    * **_State validation Act_** means an Act of a State in this jurisdiction under which certain administrative actions (within the meaning of that Act) taken, or purportedly taken, at or before the commencement by Commonwealth authorities or officers of the Commonwealth (within the meaning of that Act) pursuant to functions or powers (the **_relevant functions or powers_**) conferred, or purportedly conferred, by or under laws that include the old application Act for that State have, and are deemed always to have had, the same force and effect for all purposes as they would have had if:

     * (a) they had been taken, or purportedly taken by a State authority or officer of the State (within the meaning of that Act); and

     * (b) the relevant functions or powers had been duly conferred on those authorities or officers.

##### 1373  References to things taken or deemed to be the case etc.

    * If: 

     * (a) a law of a State or Territory in this jurisdiction had effect before the commencement:

      * (i) to take or deem something to have happened or to be the case, or to have a particular effect, under or for the purposes of the old corporations legislation of that State or Territory (or a provision of that legislation); or

      * (ii) to give something an effect for the purposes of the old corporations legislation of that State or Territory (or a provision of that legislation) that it would not otherwise have had; and

     * (b) that effect was continuing immediately before the commencement;

    * this Part applies as if that thing had actually happened or were actually the case, or as if that thing actually had that other effect.

        * Note: So, for example, if a provision of the old corporations legislation, or another law, of a State or Territory in this jurisdiction took a company to be registered under Part 2A.2 of the old Corporations Law of the State or Territory, this Part applies as if the company were actually registered under that Part.

##### 1374  Existence of several versions of old corporations legislation does not result in this Part operating to take same thing to be done several times under new corporations legislation etc.

    * If, apart from this section, a provision of this Part (the **_transitional provision_**) would, because each State or Territory in this jurisdiction had its own old corporations legislation (containing parallel provisions) before the commencement, operate so that:

     * (a) a particular thing done before the commencement would be taken to be done, or have effect, 2 or more times by, under or for the purposes of, a provision of this Act; or

     * (b) a right or liability would be created 2 or more times in respect of a particular event, circumstance or thing that happened before the commencement; or

     * (c) a particular result or effect would be produced 2 or more times for the purposes of the new corporations legislation in relation to the same matter;

    * the transitional provision is taken to operate so that: 

     * (d) if paragraph (a) applies--the thing is taken to be done or have effect only once by, under, or for the purposes of, the provision of the new corporations legislation; or

     * (e) if paragraph (b) applies--the right or liability is created only once in respect of the event, circumstance or thing; or

     * (f) if paragraph (c) applies--the result or effect is produced only once in relation to the matter.

        * Note: So, for example, if a body (because of the operation of section 102A of the old Corporations Law) was registered under section 601CB of the old Corporations Law of several States and Territories and those registrations were still in force immediately before the commencement, section 1399 does not apply separately to each of those registrations.

##### 1375  Penalty units in respect of precommencement conduct remain at $100

    * (1) If, because of this Part, an offence can be prosecuted after the commencement in respect of conduct that occurred solely before the commencement, the amount of a penalty unit in respect of that offence is $100.

    * (2) If, because of this Part, section 1314 of this Act applies to conduct that started before the commencement and that continued after the commencement, then, for the purposes of the application of that section to that conduct (including the postcommencement conduct), the amount of a penalty unit is $100.

    * (3) This section has effect despite section 4AA of the _Crimes Act 1914_.

##### 1376  Ceasing to be a referring State does not affect previous operation of this Part

    * If, after the commencement, a State ceases to be a referring State, that does not undo or affect:

     * (a) the effects that this Part has already had in relation to matters connected with that State; or

     * (b) the ongoing effect of this Act as it operates because of the effects referred to in paragraph (a).

#### Division 2--Carrying over registration of companies

##### 1377  Division has effect subject to Division 7 regulations

    * This Division has effect subject to regulations made for the purposes of Division 7.

##### 1378  Existing registered companies continue to be registered

    * (1) If:

     * (a) before the commencement, a company was registered under Part 2A.2 of the old Corporations Law of a State or Territory in this jurisdiction; and

     * (b) that registration was still in force immediately before the commencement;

    * the registration of the company has effect (and may be dealt with) after the commencement as if it were a registration of the company under Part 2A.2 of this Act as a company of whichever of the company types listed in subsection (2) corresponds to its previous class and type.

        * Note: The carrying over of other matters (for example, the registration of registered managed investment schemes and of registered bodies) is covered by the more general transitional provisions in Division 6.

    * (2) The company types are as follows:

     * (a) a proprietary company limited by shares;

     * (b) an unlimited proprietary company;

     * (c) a proprietary company limited both by shares and by guarantee;

     * (d) a public company limited by shares;

     * (e) an unlimited public company;

     * (f) a company limited by guarantee;

     * (g) a public company limited both by shares and by guarantee;

     * (h) a no liability company.

    * (3) The application of subsection (1) in relation to the registration of a company does not have the effect of creating that company as a new legal entity. Rather, it has the effect of continuing the existence of the legal entity that is that company with the same characteristics and attributes as it had immediately before the commencement. The date of the company's first registration remains the same (see subsection 1402(2)), and a new certificate of registration does not need to be issued.

        * Note: The company will, for example, retain the same name, ACN, constitution and registered office as it had immediately before the commencement. Its certificate of registration will (because of section 1399) have effect as if it were issued under section 118 of this Act.

    * (4) The State or Territory in which the company is taken to be registered is the State or Territory under whose old Corporations Law the company was registered immediately before commencement. This subsection has effect subject to subsection 119A(3).

        * Note: For the general provisions about jurisdiction of incorporation and jurisdiction of registration, see section 119A.

#### Division 3--Carrying over the old Corporations Regulations

##### 1379  Division has effect subject to Division 7 regulations

    * This Division has effect subject to regulations made for the purposes of Division 7.

##### 1380  Old Corporations Regulations continue to have effect

    * The old Corporations Regulations that were made for the purposes of provisions of the old Corporations Law that correspond to provisions of this Act and that were in force immediately before the commencement continue to have effect (and may be dealt with) after the commencement as if:

     * (a) they were regulations in force under section 1364 of this Act; and

     * (b) they were made for the purposes of the corresponding provisions of this Act.

#### Division 4--Court proceedings and orders

##### 1381  Division has effect subject to Division 7 regulations

    * This Division has effect subject to regulations made for the purposes of Division 7.

     * but not including an order making a final determination of existing rights or liabilities.

    * **_interlocutory order_** means:

     * (b) an order or direction about the conduct of a proceeding.

    * (1) This section applies to a proceeding, other than a federal corporations proceeding, in relation to which the following paragraphs are satisfied:

     * (a) the proceeding was started in a court before the commencement; and

     * (a) if subparagraph (1)(b)(i) applies--under the provision of the new corporations legislation that corresponds to the relevant old provision; or

     * (b) if subparagraph (1)(b)(ii) applies--as, or connected with, a prosecution for an offence against the provision of the new corporations legislation that corresponds to the relevant old provision.

    * To the extent that the old proceeding, before the commencement, related to precommencement rights or liabilities, the new proceeding relates to the substituted rights and liabilities in relation to those precommencement rights or liabilities

        * Note 1: See sections 1400 and 1401 for the creation of substituted rights and liabilities.

        * Note 2: In all cases, there will be a provision of the new corporations legislation that corresponds to the relevant old provision, either because:

          * (a) the new corporations legislation actually contains a provision that corresponds to the relevant old provision; or

          * (b) the new corporations legislation, because of section 1401 or 1408, is taken to include the relevant old provision (whether with or without modifications), in which case the provision so taken to be included will be the corresponding provision.

     * (a) the parties to the new proceeding are the same as the parties to the old proceeding;

     * (b) subject to subsections (5) and (6), and to any order to the contrary made by the court, the court must deal with the new proceeding as if the steps that had been taken for the purposes of the old proceeding before the commencement had been taken for the purposes of the new proceeding.

     * (a) an interlocutory order was made before the commencement for the purpose of, or in relation to, the old proceeding; and

     * (b) to the extent that the proceeding, before the commencement, related to precommencement rights or liabilities, the proceeding, as continued, relates, and as so continuing is taken always to have related, to the substituted rights and liabilities in relation to those precommencement rights or liabilities

        * Note 1: See sections 1400 and 1401 for the creation of substituted rights and liabilities.

        * Note 2: In all cases, there will be a provision of the new corporations legislation that corresponds to the relevant old provision, either because:

##### 1384B  Effect of decisions and orders made in federal corporations proceedings before commencement

     * (a) a proceeding was started in a court before the commencement; and

     * (b) the proceeding was a federal corporations proceeding that related to a matter to which a provision of the old corporations legislation of a State or Territory in this jurisdiction applied; and

     * (a) make a person liable, under the new corporations legislation, to any penalty (whether civil or criminal) provided for in an order referred to in paragraph (2)(a) or (b); or

     * (b) enable an enforcement proceeding, or an appeal or review proceeding, in relation to such an order to be taken in a court under the new corporations legislation; or

     * (c) enable proceedings by way of appeal, or other review, of such an order to be taken in a court under the new corporations legislation.

##### 1393  Transitional provisions relating to section 1351 fees

##### 1400  Creation of equivalent rights and liabilities to those that existed before the commencement under carried over provisions of the old corporations legislation

    * (1) Subject to subsection (4), this section applies in relation to a right or liability (the **_precommencement right or liability_**), whether civil or criminal, that:

     * (a) was acquired, accrued or incurred under a carried over provision of the old corporations legislation of a State or Territory in this jurisdiction; and

     * (b) was in existence immediately before the commencement.

    * However, this section does not apply to a right or liability under an order made by a court before the commencement.

    * (2) On the commencement, the person acquires, accrues or incurs a right or liability (the **_substituted right or liability_**), equivalent to the precommencement right or liability, under the corresponding provision of the new corporations legislation (as if that provision applied to the conduct or circumstances that gave rise to the precommencement right or liability).

        * Note: If a time limit applied in relation to the precommencement right or liability under the old corporations legislation, that same time limit (calculated from the same starting point) will apply under the new corporations legislation to the substituted right or liability--see subsection 1402(3).

    * (3) A procedure, proceeding or remedy in respect of the substituted right or liability may be instituted after the commencement under the new corporations legislation (as if that provision applied to the conduct or circumstances that gave rise to the precommencement right or liability).

        * Note: For precommencement proceedings in respect of substituted rights and liabilities, see sections 1383 and 1384.

    * (4) If, immediately before the commencement, a person had an accrued right to make a claim under a provision of Part 7.10 of the old Corporations Law of a State that is not a referring State (and so is not in this jurisdiction), this section applies in relation to that right in the same way as it would have applied if the State had been a referring State.

        * Note: Except to the extent provided in this subsection, this Part does not create rights and liabilities that are equivalent to those that existed under the old corporations legislation of a nonreferring State.

##### 1401  Creation of equivalent rights and liabilities to those that existed before the commencement under repealed provisions of the old corporations legislation

    * (1) This section applies in relation to a right or liability (the **_precommencement right or liability_**), whether civil or criminal, that:

     * (a) was acquired, accrued or incurred under a provision of the old corporations legislation of a State or Territory in this jurisdiction that was no longer in force immediately before the commencement; and

     * (b) was in existence immediately before the commencement.

    * However, this section does not apply to a right or liability under an order made by a court before the commencement.

    * (2) For the purposes of subsections (3) and (4), the new corporations legislation is taken to include:

     * (a) the provision of the old corporations legislation (with such modifications (if any) as are necessary) under which the precommencement right or liability was acquired, accrued or incurred; and

     * (b) the other provisions of the old corporations legislation (with such modifications (if any) as are necessary) that applied in relation to the precommencement right or liability.

    * (3) On the commencement, the person acquires, accrues or incurs a right or liability (the **_substituted right or liability_**), equivalent to the precommencement right or liability, under the provision taken to be included in the new corporations legislation by paragraph (2)(a) (as if that provision applied to the conduct or circumstances that gave rise to the precommencement right or liability).

        * Note: If a time limit applied in relation to the precommencement right or liability under the old corporations legislation, that same time limit (calculated from the same starting point) will apply under the new corporations legislation to the substituted right or liability--see subsection 1402(3).

    * (4) A procedure, proceeding or remedy in respect of the substituted right or liability may be instituted after the commencement under the provisions taken to be included in the new corporations legislation by subsection (2) (as if those provisions applied to the conduct or circumstances that gave rise to the precommencement right or liability).

        * Note: For precommencement proceedings in respect of substituted rights and liabilities, see sections 1383 and 1384.

##### 1402  Old corporations legislation time limits etc.

    * (1) An old corporations legislation time limit (see subsection (4)):

     * (a) the starting point of which:

      * (i) was known or had been determined before the commencement (whether that starting point occurred or would occur before, on or after the commencement); or

      * (ii) would have become known, or have been determined, after the commencement if the old corporations legislation of the relevant State or Territory had continued to apply (whether that starting point would have occurred before, on or after the commencement); and

     * (b) that had not ended at or before the commencement;

    * continues to run, or starts or started to run, as if that same time limit (starting from the same starting point) were applicable under the new corporations legislation.

    * (2) If:

     * (a) under the old corporations legislation, a process (for example, the winding up of a company), a status of a person or body (for example, a body's registration as a company or a person's status as a registered liquidator), or an instrument, commenced from a particular time before the commencement; and

     * (b) that process, status or instrument is continued after the commencement for the purposes of the new corporations legislation by a provision of this Part;

    * that process, status or instrument as so continued is still taken to have commenced from the time referred to in paragraph (a).

    * (3) If an old corporations legislation time limit related to a precommencement right or liability, the same time limit applies in relation to the substituted right or liability.

    * (4) In this section:

    * **_old corporations legislation time limit_** includes:

     * (a) a period for the doing of a thing specified or determined under a provision of the old corporations legislation of a State or Territory; or

     * (b) a period specified or determined under a provision of the old corporations legislation of a State or Territory as the duration of a particular instrument or status.

##### 1403  Preservation of significance etc. of events or circumstances

    * (1) An event, circumstance or other thing:

     * (a) that occurred or arose before the commencement under or as mentioned in a provision of the old corporations legislation of a State or Territory in this jurisdiction; and

     * (b) that had a particular significance, status or effect for the purposes of a carried over provision of that legislation (including because of an interpretive provision);

    * has that same significance, status and effect after the commencement for the purposes of the provision of the new corporations legislation that corresponds to that carried over provision.

        * Note: So, for example:

          * (a) if a company took action before the commencement that had the result for the purposes of section 200B of the old Corporations Law of making a superannuation fund a prescribed superannuation fund in relation to the company, that action has that same effect for the purposes of section 200B of this Act; and

          * (b) a delay that could have been taken into account for the purposes of subsection 874(1) of the old Corporations Law also counts for the purposes of subsection 874(1) of this Act.

    * (2) Without limiting subsection (1), an event, circumstance or other thing had a particular significance for the purposes of a carried over provision of the old corporations legislation of a State or Territory in this jurisdiction if:

     * (a) the carried over provision created an obligation in respect of the event, circumstance or thing (whenever it arose); or

     * (b) the carried over provision provided for the event, circumstance or thing to be dealt with in a particular way; or

     * (c) the carried over provision stated that the event, circumstance or thing (whenever it arose) was to be disregarded for the purposes of that provision or was not covered by that provision.

##### 1404  References in the new corporations legislation generally include references to events, circumstances or things that happened or arose before the commencement

    * (1) Subject to this section, a reference in the new corporations legislation to an event, circumstance or thing of a particular kind that happens or arises, or that has happened or arisen, is taken to include a reference to an event, circumstance or thing of that kind that happened or arose at a time before the commencement, unless a contrary intention is expressed. The fact that the provision uses only the present tense in referring to an event, circumstance or thing is not, of itself, to be regarded as an expression of a contrary intention.

        * Note: So, for example, if a provision of the new corporations legislation refers to a person who consents to a course of action, that reference (in the absence of an express provision to the contrary) will not be limited to consents given after the commencement and will cover a consent given before the commencement.

    * (2) Nothing in subsection (1) is taken to produce a result that a right or liability exists under a provision of the new corporations legislation that relates solely to events, circumstances or things that occurred before the commencement.

        * Note: Instead, an equivalent right or liability will be created by section 1400 or 1401.

    * (3) The regulations may provide that subsection (1) does not apply in relation to a particular reference or class of references in the new corporations legislation.

##### 1405  References in the new corporations legislation to that legislation or the new ASIC legislation generally include references to corresponding provisions of the old corporations legislation or old ASIC legislation

    * (1) Subject to subsection (4), a reference in the new corporations legislation to:

     * (a) an Act, or regulations or another instrument that is part of the new corporations legislation; or

     * (a) an Act, or regulations or some other instrument that is part of the new ASIC legislation; or

    * is taken, in relation to events, circumstances or things that happened or arose at a time before the commencement when the old corporations legislation was in force, to include (in the absence of an express provision to the contrary) a reference to the corresponding part, provision or provisions of the old ASIC legislation of the Commonwealth, of the States in this jurisdiction and of the Northern Territory.

    * (3) In subsection (2):

     * (a) **_new ASIC legislation_** and **_old ASIC legislation_** have the same meanings as they have in Part 16 of the _Australian Securities and Investments Commission Act 2001_; and

     * (b) the question whether a provision or part of the old ASIC legislation corresponds to a provision of part of the new ASIC legislation is to be determined in the same way as it is determined for the purposes of Part 16 of the _Australian Securities and Investments Commission Act 2001_.

    * (4) The regulations may provide that subsection (1) or (2) does not apply in relation to a particular reference or class of references in the new corporations legislation.

##### 1406  Carrying over references to corresponding previous laws

    * (1) If a carried over provision of the old corporations legislation of a State or Territory in this jurisdiction contained a reference (whether in its own terms or by operation of another provision) to:

     * (a) a corresponding previous law (as defined for the purposes of that provision or provisions including that provision); or

     * (b) a thing done by, under, or for the purposes of, such a law;

    * the corresponding provision of the new corporations legislation is taken to contain an equivalent reference to that previous law, or to such a thing done by, under, or for the purposes of, that previous law.

    * (2) The following references in the old corporations legislation of the States and Territories in this jurisdiction are covered by subsection (1) in the same way as they would be if they used the "corresponding previous law" form of words:

     * (a) the reference in subsection 1274AA(1) to a "previous Law";

     * (b) the reference in subparagraph 1274AA(2)(b)(ii) to a "previous law of this jurisdiction before the commencement of this Part that corresponds";

     * (c) any other references prescribed by the regulations for the purposes of this subsection.

##### 1407  References to old corporations legislation in instruments

    * (1) Subject to subsection (2), a reference in, or taken immediately before the commencement to be in, an instrument, other than:

     * (a) an Act of a State, the Australian Capital Territory, the Northern Territory or Norfolk Island; or

     * (b) an instrument made under such an Act;

    * to: 

     * (c) an Act, or to regulations or some other instrument, that is part of the old corporations legislation (whether the reference is in general terms or in relation to a particular State or Territory in this jurisdiction); or

     * (d) to a provision or group of provisions of such an Act, regulations or other instrument;

    * is taken, after the commencement, to include a reference to the corresponding part, provision or provisions of the new corporations legislation (unless there is no such corresponding part, provision or provisions).

        * Note: This section will, for example, apply to:

          * (a) a reference in another Commonwealth Act to the Corporations Law; or

          * (b) a reference in the Corporations Regulations to the Corporations Law; or

          * (c) a reference in a company's constitution to a particular provision of the Corporations Law.

    * (2) The regulations may do either or both of the following:

     * (a) provide that subsection (1) does not apply in relation to prescribed references in prescribed instruments;

     * (b) provide that subsection (1) has effect in relation to prescribed references in prescribed instruments as if, in that subsection, the words "to be" were substituted for the words "to include".

##### 1408  Old transitional provisions continue to have their effect

    * (1) Subject to subsection (3), this Act has the same effect, after the commencement, as it would have if:

     * (a) the transitional provisions (see subsections (6) and (7)) of the old Corporations Laws of the States and Territories in this jurisdiction (as in force from time to time before the commencement) had been part of this Act; and

     * (b) those transitional provisions produced the same results or effects (to the greatest extent possible) for the purposes of this Act as they produced for the purposes of those old Corporations Laws.

    * (2) Without limiting subsection (1) (but subject to subsection (3)), if a transitional provision of the old Corporations Law of a State or Territory in this jurisdiction could, if it had continued in force after the commencement, have operated to give rise to rights and liabilities (including civil or criminal liabilities) in relation to acts or omissions occurring after the commencement, this Act is taken to include that transitional provision (with such modifications (if any) as are necessary.

        * Note: In relation to acts or omissions that occurred before the commencement, equivalent rights and liabilities are created by sections 1400 and 1401.

    * (3) The regulations may determine how a matter dealt with in a transitional provision of the old Corporations Law of a State or Territory in this jurisdiction is to be dealt with under or in relation to the new corporations legislation (including by creating offences). The regulations have effect despite subsections (1) and (2), but subject to subsection (5).

        * Note: In creating offences, the regulations are subject to the limitation imposed by section 1375.

    * (4) For the purpose of determining whether the new corporations legislation includes a provision that corresponds to a provision of the old corporations legislation of a State or Territory, and for the purpose of any reference in this part to a corresponding provision of the new corporations legislation, this Act is taken to include the transitional provisions of the old corporations legislation of the States and Territories, as they have effect because of subsections (1) and (2).

    * (5) Nothing in subsection (1) or (2), or in regulations made for the purposes of subsection (3), is taken to produce a result that a right or liability exists under a transitional provision as it has effect because of subsection (1) or (2), or exists under regulations made for the purposes of subsection (3), that relates solely to events, circumstances or things that occurred before the commencement.

        * Note: Instead, an equivalent right or liability will be created by section 1400 or 1401.

    * (6) Subject to subsection (7), for the purposes of this section, a **_transitional provision_** is any of the provisions of the old Corporations Laws of the States and Territories in this jurisdiction listed in the following table.

    * (7) The regulations may provide that certain provisions are to be taken to be included in, or omitted from, the table in subsection (6). The table then has effect as if the provisions were so included in it or omitted from it.

    * (4) Despite subsection 12(2) of the _Legislative Instruments Act 2003_, regulations for the purposes of this section may be expressed to take effect from a date before the regulations are registered under that Act.

    * (5) In this section:

##### Subdivision B--Treatment of existing markets

##### 1411  When is a market being operated immediately before the FSR commencement?

    * Subject to section 1412, in this Subdivision, a reference to a market **_being operated immediately before the FSR commencement_** is a reference to a market that had not permanently ceased to operate before the FSR commencement, even if trading on the market was not actually occurring immediately before the FSR commencement (for example, because of a routine temporary closure of the market).

##### 1412  Treatment of proposed markets that have not started to operate by the FSR commencement

    * (1) This section applies in relation to the following proposed markets, other than any such market that starts to operate before the FSR commencement:

     * (a) a market proposed to be operated by Bendigo Stock Exchange Ltd, or by ASX Futures Exchange Pty Limited, that is identified in writing by the Minister as being a proposed market to which this section applies;

     * (b) any other proposed market identified in, or in accordance with, regulations made for the purposes of this paragraph.

    * For this purpose, a **_proposed market _**is a market that a person has, before the FSR commencement, indicated an intention that they propose to operate.

    * (2) This Subdivision applies in relation to a proposed market to which this section applies subject to the following paragraphs:

     * (a) subject to paragraphs (b), (c) and (d), this Subdivision applies in relation to the proposed market as if the market, as proposed to be operated, were in fact being operated immediately before the FSR commencement;

     * (b) if, taking account of the effect of paragraph (a), section 1413 applies in relation to the proposed market, that section applies in relation to the proposed market:

      * (i) as if the Minister's obligation to grant a licence, and impose conditions, under subsection 1413(2) in relation to the market does not arise unless and until the market operator lodges with ASIC a notice in relation to the market under subsection (3) of this section, and does not arise at all if no such notice is given to ASIC by the end of 6 months after the FSR commencement; and

      * (ii) as if subsection 1413(3) provided for a licence so granted under subsection 1413(2) in relation to the market, and the conditions subject to which it is granted, to be taken to have had effect from the day (the **_start day_**) specified in the subsection (3) notice as the day on which the market started to operate; and

      * (iii) as if subsection 1413(6) were omitted; and

      * (iv) as if the references in subsection 1413(8) to the FSR commencement were instead references to the start day;

     * (c) if:

      * (i) taking account of the effect of paragraph (a), section 1418, 1420, 1421 or 1422 applies to the proposed market; and

      * (ii) the market operator does not lodge with ASIC a notice in relation to the market under subsection (3) of this section by the end of 6 months after the FSR commencement;

     * that section ceases to apply in relation to the proposed market at the end of that period;

     * (d) if a provision of this Subdivision provides for a provision of the old Corporations Act to continue to apply in relation to the proposed market, then (without limiting the generality of subsection 1410(3)), while the proposed market remains nonoperational, the provision of the old Corporations Act only applies in relation to the proposed market to the extent (if any) to which it would, disregarding the effect of paragraph (a), apply in relation to the proposed market.

    * (3) If a proposed market to which this section applies starts to operate on a day during the period of 6 months starting on the FSR commencement, the operator must, as soon as practicable, and in any event within 7 days, lodge with ASIC written notice of the fact that the market started to operate on that day.

        * Note: Failure to comply with this subsection is an offence (see subsection 1311(1)).

    * (4) ASIC must, within a reasonable time, give the Minister a notice it receives under subsection (3).

##### 1413  Obligation of Minister to grant licences covering main existing markets

    * (1) This section applies to each market being operated immediately before the FSR commencement in relation to which any of the following paragraphs applies:

     * (a) the market was a stock market operated by the Australian Stock Exchange Limited;

     * (b) the market was a stock market operated by a body corporate covered by an approval in force under subsection 769(2) of the old Corporations Act;

     * (c) the market was a futures market operated by a body corporate covered by an approval in force under subsection 1126(2) of the old Corporations Act.

    * (2) Subject to subsections (3) and (4), the Minister must, in relation to each market to which this section applies, grant the operator of the market a licence, and impose conditions on that licence, in accordance with the following requirements:

     * (a) the licence must be described as an Australian market licence;

     * (b) the licence must be granted subject to the following conditions:

      * (i) a condition specifying the market as the market that the licence authorises the licensee to operate;

      * (ii) a condition specifying, as the classes of financial products that can be dealt with on the market, the classes that are appropriate for the market under subsection (5);

      * (iii) if the Minister considers that the licensee should have clearing and settlement arrangements for transactions effected through the market--a condition specifying the type of clearing and settlement arrangements that are adequate.

    * (3) Subject to subsection (6), a licence that subsection (2) requires to be granted must be granted on, or as soon as practicable after, the FSR commencement. If it is granted after the FSR commencement, it, and the conditions subject to which it is granted, are taken to have had effect from that commencement.

    * (4) Sections 795D (more than one licence in the same document) and 795E (more than one market covered by the same licence) of the amended Corporations Act apply in relation to the granting of licences, and licences granted, under this section as if the licences were, or were being, granted under section 795B of that Act. If, pursuant to section 795E, a single licence is granted under this section in respect of several separate markets, paragraph (2)(b) of this section must be complied with separately in the licence document in relation to each of those markets.

    * (5) For the purposes of subparagraph (2)(b)(ii), the classes of financial products that are **_appropriate_** for a market to which this section applies are as follows:

     * (a) for a market described in paragraph (1)(a) or (b)--securities, within the meaning of section 92 of the old Corporations Act as applying for the purposes of Part 7.2 of the old Corporations Act, and agreements of a kind to which section 92A of the old Corporations Act applied immediately before the FSR commencement (or would have applied after the FSR commencement if that section, and any associated provisions, had continued to have effect);

     * (b) for a market described in paragraph (1)(c)--futures contracts, within the meaning of section 72 of the old Corporations Act, and agreements of a kind to which section 72A of the old Corporations Act applied immediately before the FSR commencement (or would have applied after the FSR commencement if that section, and any associated provisions, had continued to have effect).

    * (6) Despite anything in subsection (3), the Minister may, under this section, grant a licence, and impose conditions on the licence, at any time during the period starting on the commencement of this section and ending on the FSR commencement on the basis that matters known to the Minister in relation to the market concerned will continue to be the case up to the FSR commencement. If the Minister does so:

     * (a) the licence and conditions come into effect on the FSR commencement, and not before; and

     * (b) the Minister may vary or revoke the licence, or any of the conditions, before the FSR commencement if the Minister considers it appropriate to do so having regard to the provisions of this section concerning the granting of licences and the imposition of conditions; and

     * (c) the licence and conditions do not come into effect on the FSR commencement if, immediately before the FSR commencement, the market is not a market to which this section applies.

    * (7) If the Minister grants a licence under this section, the Minister must give the operator of the market written notice of:

     * (a) the grant of the licence, and the conditions imposed on the licence; and

     * (b) any subsequent revocation or variation under subsection (6) of the licence or conditions.

    * (8) A notice advising of the grant of a licence under this section must contain a statement to the effect that the licence and conditions will not take effect until the FSR commencement, or will be taken to have had effect from the FSR commencement, as the case requires.

##### 1414  Section 1413 markets--effect of licences and conditions

    * (1) Subject to subsections (2) to (4):

     * (a) a licence granted under section 1413 that authorises the operation of a market is, for the purposes of the amended Corporations Act (other than this section), taken to have been granted (and to have been properly granted) under section 795B of the amended Corporations Act; and

     * (b) conditions imposed under section 1413 on the licence are, for the purposes of the amended Corporations Act (other than this section), taken to have been imposed (and to have been properly imposed) under section 796A of the amended Corporations Act.

        * Note 1: Section 795C of the amended Corporations Act (publication of notice of licence grant) applies to the grant of the licence.

        * Note 2: The conditions may be varied or revoked, and additional conditions may be imposed, under section 796A of the amended Corporations Act.

    * (2) Subject to subsection (4), the relevant new legislation (see subsection (6)) does not apply in relation to the market during the period (the **_transition period_**) starting on the FSR commencement and ending on whichever of the following first occurs:

     * (a) the end of the period of 2 years starting on the FSR commencement;

     * (b) conditions on the licence are varied or revoked, or additional conditions are imposed on the licence, pursuant to an application by the licensee under subsection 796A(2) of the amended Corporations Act;

     * (c) the licensee has lodged with ASIC notice in writing that it wants to take advantage of the compensation arrangements under Division 3 of Part 7.5 of the amended Corporations Act:

      * (i) from a specified date, being a date that is after the notice is given to ASIC and that is after compensation arrangements for the market have been approved under Division 3 of Part 7.5 of the amended Corporations Act (see also subsection (4)); or

      * (ii) from the end of a specified period, being a period that is described as starting when compensation arrangements for the market are approved under Division 3 of Part 7.5 of the amended Corporations Act (see also subsection (4)) and that ends after the notice is given to ASIC;

     * and that date arrives or period ends.

    * (3) A notice (the **_original notice_**) given for the purposes of paragraph (2)(c) may, before the date, or the end of the period, specified in the original notice as mentioned in that paragraph:

     * (a) be varied to specify another date or period, being a date or period that would satisfy the requirements of subparagraph (2)(c)(i) or (ii) if the reference in that subparagraph to when the notice (being the original notice) is given to ASIC were instead a reference to when the notice of variation is given to ASIC under this subsection; or

     * (b) be revoked.

    * The variation or revocation must be made by notice in writing lodged with ASIC.

    * (4) If the relevant new legislation in relation to a market includes Part 7.5 of the amended Corporations Act, then, despite subsection (2), Division 3 of that Part applies to the market during the transition period to the extent necessary for the operator to apply to have compensation arrangements for the market approved before the end of the transition period, and for that application to be determined. However, any approval of the arrangements under that Division does not take effect until immediately after the end of the transition period.

    * (5) The annual report of the licensee (see section 792F of the amended Corporations Act) for a financial year in which part of the transition period occurs, other than a financial year in which the transition period ends, must include information about:

     * (b) the steps proposed to be taken in the next year;

    * to ensure that the relevant new legislation will be complied with by the time the transition period ends.

    * (6) In this section:

    * **_relevant new legislation_**, in relation to a market, means:

     * (a) section 793A of the amended Corporations Act; and

    * (1) If, during the transition period in relation to a market the operation of which is authorised by a licence granted under section 1413, Part 7.5 of the amended Corporations Act does not apply in relation to the market (except as provided in subsection 1414(4)) because of subsection 1414(2), Part 7.9, or Part 8.6, as the case requires, of the old Corporations Act, and any associated provisions, continue to apply in relation to the market during the transition period.

    * Preservation of certain ongoing requirements

    * (2) During the transition period in relation to a market:

     * (a) the operation of which is authorised by a licence granted under section 1413; and

     * (b) that, immediately before the FSR commencement, was a securities exchange to which section 769A of the old Corporations Act applied;

    * the following provisions continue to apply in relation to the market: 

     * (c) paragraphs 769A(1)(c) and (e) of the old Corporations Act, and any associated provisions;

    * (2) Regulations made for the purposes of subsection (1) have effect despite anything in sections 1414 and 1415.

    * (3) Subsection (1) gives a full power to disapply, apply and modify provisions as mentioned in that subsection, including for reasons that do not have an express or implied connection with the transition to the relevant new legislation.

        * Note: So (for example), a change to the daytoday operation of the relevant old legislation as continuing to apply may be achieved by a modification under paragraph (1)(b) (whether that change is to an existing rule, or is the addition of a new rule).

    * (2) Subject to subsection (3), section 791A of the amended Corporations Act does not apply in relation to the market in so far as all or any of the additional products are dealt with on the market during the period (the **_transition period_**) starting on the FSR commencement and ending on whichever of the following first occurs:

     * (a) the end of the period of 2 years starting on the FSR commencement;

    * (4) The instrument of approval (including any conditions specified in the instrument) for a stock market to which this section applies cannot be varied during the transition period for the market so as to cover the market providing services that were not covered by the instrument as in force immediately before the FSR commencement. However it may be varied in other ways, or revoked, by the Minister in writing.

    * (5) The regulations may do all or any of the following:

     * (a) provide that some or all of the relevant old legislation does not apply in relation to a stock market to which this section applies during some or all of the transition period for the market;

##### Subdivision C--Treatment of existing clearing and settlement facilities

##### 1423  When is a clearing and settlement facility being operated immediately before the FSR commencement?

    * Subject to section 1424, in this Subdivision, a reference to a clearing and settlement facility **_being operated immediately before the FSR commencement_** is a reference to a clearing and settlement facility that had not permanently ceased to operate before the FSR commencement, even if the clearing and settlement of transactions by means of the facility was not actually occurring immediately before the FSR commencement (for example, because of a routine temporary closure of the facility).

##### 1424  Treatment of proposed clearing and settlement facilities that have not started to operate by the FSR commencement

    * (1) This section applies in relation to any proposed clearing and settlement facilities identified in, or in accordance with, regulations made for the purposes of this subsection. For this purpose, a **_proposed clearing and settlement facility _**is a clearing and settlement facility that a person has, before the FSR commencement, indicated an intention that they propose to operate.

    * (2) This Subdivision applies in relation to a proposed clearing and settlement facility to which this section applies subject to the following paragraphs:

     * (a) subject to paragraphs (b), (c) and (d), this Subdivision applies in relation to the proposed facility as if the facility, as proposed to be operated, were in fact being operated immediately before the FSR commencement;

     * (b) if, taking account of the effect of paragraph (a), section 1425 applies in relation to the proposed facility, that section applies in relation to the proposed facility:

      * (i) as if the Minister's obligation to grant a licence, and impose conditions, under subsection 1425(2) in relation to the proposed facility does not arise unless and until the facility operator lodges with ASIC a notice in relation to the facility under subsection (3) of this section, and does not arise at all if no such notice is given to ASIC by the end of 6 months after the FSR commencement; and

      * (ii) as if subsection 1425(3) provided for a licence so granted under subsection 1425(2) in relation to the facility, and the conditions subject to which it is granted, to be taken to have had effect from the day (the **_start day_**) specified in the subsection (3) notice as the day on which the facility started to operate; and

      * (iii) as if subsection 1425(6) were omitted; and

      * (iv) as if the references in subsection 1425(8) to the FSR commencement were instead references to the start day;

     * (c) if:

      * (i) taking account of the effect of paragraph (a), section 1429 applies to the proposed facility; and

      * (ii) the facility operator does not lodge with ASIC a notice in relation to the facility under subsection (3) of this section by the end of 6 months after the FSR commencement;

     * that section ceases to apply in relation to the proposed facility at the end of that period;

     * (d) if a provision of this Subdivision provides for a provision of the old Corporations Act to continue to apply in relation to the proposed facility, then (without limiting the generality of subsection 1410(3)), while the proposed facility remains nonoperational, the provision of the old Corporations Act only applies in relation to the proposed facility to the extent (if any) to which it would, disregarding the effect of paragraph (a), apply in relation to the proposed facility.

    * (3) If a proposed clearing and settlement facility to which this section applies starts to operate on a day during the period of 6 months starting on the FSR commencement, the operator must, as soon as practicable, and in any event within 7 days, lodge with ASIC written notice of the fact that the facility started to operate on that day.

        * Note: Failure to comply with this subsection is an offence (see subsection 1311(1)).

    * (4) ASIC must, within a reasonable time, give the Minister a notice it receives under subsection (3).

##### 1424A  Treatment of unregulated clearing and settlement facilities operated by holders of old Corporations Act approvals

    * (1) This section applies in relation to a clearing and settlement facility if:

     * (a) the facility was being operated immediately before the FSR commencement by a body corporate in relation to which an approval under section 1131 of the old Corporations Act was in force at that time; but

     * (b) the services provided by the facility as so operated were not such that section 1128 of the old Corporations Act required the operator to be so approved.

    * (2) In this section:

     * (a) a reference to the **_unregulated services_** is a reference to the services referred to in paragraph (1)(b); and

     * (b) a reference to **_regulated services _**is a reference to services that, if they had been provided by the facility immediately before the commencement, would have been services to which section 1128 of the old Corporations Act applied.

    * (3) For the purposes of section 1425 (as it operates of its own force, rather than because of section 1424), the facility is not to be regarded as a facility that was being operated immediately before the FSR commencement.

    * (4) If the operator has, before the FSR commencement, indicated an intention that they propose to extend the services provided by the facility so that they also cover regulated services:

     * (a) regulations made for the purposes of subsection 1424(1) may identify the facility as a proposed clearing and settlement facility, but only in relation to those regulated services; and

     * (b) if they do so, section 1424, and section 1425 as it applies because of section 1424, apply in relation to the facility and those regulated services as if the facility did not already provide the unregulated services.

##### 1425  Obligation of Minister to grant licences covering main existing facilities

    * (1) This section applies to each clearing and settlement facility being operated immediately before the FSR commencement in relation to which either of the following paragraphs applies:

     * (a) the facility was being operated by the body corporate that was, for the purposes of the old Corporations Act, the securities clearing house;

     * (b) the facility was being operated by a body corporate in relation to which an approval (the **_section 1131 approval_**) under section 1131 of the old Corporations Act was in force at that time.

    * (2) Subject to subsections (3) and (4), the Minister must, in relation to each clearing and settlement facility to which this section applies, grant the operator of the facility a licence, and impose conditions on that licence, in accordance with the following requirements:

     * (a) the licence must be described as an Australian CS facility licence;

     * (b) the licence must be granted subject to the following conditions:

      * (i) a condition specifying the facility as the facility that the licence authorises the licensee to operate;

      * (ii) a condition specifying, as the classes of financial products in respect of which the facility can provide services, the classes that are appropriate for the facility under subsection (5);

      * (iii) in the case of a facility to which paragraph (1)(b) applies--a condition to the effect that the licence only covers the facility providing services for the market or markets that were covered by the section 1131 approval.

    * (3) Subject to subsection (6), a licence that subsection (2) requires to be granted must be granted on, or as soon as practicable after, the FSR commencement. If it is granted after the FSR commencement, it, and the conditions subject to which it is granted, are taken to have had effect from that commencement.

    * (4) Sections 824D (more than one licence in the same document) and 824E (more than one CS facility covered by the same licence) of the amended Corporations Act apply in relation to the granting of licences, and licences granted, under this section as if the licences were, or were being, granted under section 824B of that Act. If, pursuant to section 824E, a single licence is granted under this section in respect of several separate facilities, paragraph (2)(b) of this section must be complied with separately in the licence document in relation to each of those facilities.

    * (5) For the purposes of subparagraph (2)(b)(ii), the classes of financial products that are **_appropriate_** for a facility to which this section applies are as follows:

     * (a) for a facility described in paragraph (1)(a)--securities, within the meaning of section 92 of the old Corporations Act as applying for the purposes of Part 7.2 of the old Corporations Act, and agreements of a kind to which section 92A of the old Corporations Act applied immediately before the FSR commencement (or would have applied after the FSR commencement if that section, and any associated provisions, had continued to have effect);

     * (b) for a facility described in paragraph (1)(b)--futures contracts, within the meaning of section 72 of the old Corporations Act, and agreements of a kind to which section 72A of the old Corporations Act applied immediately before the FSR commencement (or would have applied after the FSR commencement if that section, and any associated provisions, had continued to have effect).

    * (6) Despite anything in subsection (3), the Minister may, under this section, grant a licence, and impose conditions on the licence, at any time during the period starting on the commencement of this section and ending on the FSR commencement on the basis that matters known to the Minister in relation to the clearing and settlement facility concerned will continue to be the case up to the FSR commencement. If the Minister does so:

     * (a) the licence and conditions come into effect on the FSR commencement, and not before; and

     * (b) the Minister may vary or revoke the licence, or any of the conditions, before the FSR commencement if the Minister considers it appropriate to do so having regard to the provisions of this section concerning the granting of licences and the imposition of conditions; and

     * (c) the licence and conditions do not come into effect on the FSR commencement if, immediately before the FSR commencement, the facility is not a clearing and settlement facility to which this section applies.

    * (7) If the Minister grants a licence under this section, the Minister must give the operator of the clearing and settlement facility written notice of:

     * (a) the grant of the licence, and the conditions imposed on the licence; and

     * (b) any subsequent revocation or variation under subsection (6) of the licence or conditions.

    * (8) A notice advising of the grant of a licence under this section must contain a statement to the effect that the licence and conditions will not take effect until the FSR commencement, or will be taken to have had effect from the FSR commencement, as the case requires.

##### 1426  Section 1425 facilities--effect of licences and conditions

    * (1) Subject to subsections (2) to (4):

     * (a) a licence granted under section 1425 that authorises the operation of a facility is, for the purposes of the amended Corporations Act (other than this section), taken to have been granted (and to have been properly granted) under section 824B of the amended Corporations Act; and

     * (b) conditions imposed under section 1425 on the licence are, for the purposes of the amended Corporations Act (other than this section), taken to have been imposed (and to have been properly imposed) under section 825A of the amended Corporations Act.

        * Note 1: Section 824C of the amended Corporations Act (publication of notice of licence grant) applies to the grant of the licence.

        * Note 2: The conditions may be varied or revoked, and additional conditions may be imposed, under section 825A of the amended Corporations Act.

    * (2) Section 822A of the amended Corporations Act does not apply in relation to the facility during the period (the **_transition period_**) starting on the FSR commencement and ending on whichever of the following first occurs:

     * (a) the end of the period of 2 years starting on the FSR commencement;

     * (b) conditions on the licence are varied or revoked, or additional conditions are imposed on the licence, pursuant to an application by the licensee under subsection 825A(2) of the amended Corporations Act.

    * (3) The annual report of the licensee (see section 821E of the amended Corporations Act) for a financial year in which part of the transition period occurs, other than a financial year in which the transition period ends, must include information about:

     * (a) the steps taken in the year; and

     * (b) the steps proposed to be taken in the next year;

    * to ensure that section 822A of the amended Corporations Act will be complied with by the time the transition period ends.

##### 1427  Section 1425 facilities--powers for regulations to change how the old and new Corporations Act apply during the transition period

    * (1) The regulations may do either or both of the following in relation to a clearing and settlement facility the operation of which is authorised by a licence granted under section 1425:

     * (a) provide that section 822A of the amended Corporations Act, and any associated provisions, apply in relation to the facility during some or all the transition period for the facility;

     * (b) provide that specified provisions of the amended Corporations Act (including section 822A), and any associated provisions, apply in relation to the facility during some or all of the transition period for the facility with specified modifications.

    * (2) Regulations made for the purposes of subsection (1) have effect despite anything in section 1426.

##### 1428  Section 1425 facilities--additional provisions relating to previously unregulated services

     * (c) the facility also, immediately before the commencement, provided services in respect of one or more other classes of financial products (the **_additional products_**) and the fact that it did so did not constitute a contravention of a provision of the old Corporations Act.

    * (2) Subject to subsection (3), section 820A of the amended Corporations Act does not apply in relation to the facility in so far as it provides services in respect of all or any of the additional products during the period (the **_transition period_**) starting on the FSR commencement and ending on whichever of the following first occurs:

     * (a) the end of the period of 2 years starting on the FSR commencement;

     * (b) conditions on the licence are varied or revoked, or additional conditions are imposed on the licence, pursuant to an application by the licensee under subsection 825A(2) of the amended Corporations Act.

##### 1429  Treatment of other clearing and settlement facilities

    * (1) This section applies to each clearing and settlement facility being operated immediately before the FSR commencement in relation to which both of the following paragraphs are satisfied:

     * (a) the clearing and settlement facility is not a facility to which section 1425 applies;

##### Subdivision D--Treatment of people who carry on financial services businesses and their representatives

##### 1430  Meaning of regulated principal, regulated activities and relevant old legislation

    * (1) For the purposes of this Subdivision, a person is a **_regulated principal _**if, immediately before the FSR commencement, the person is a person described in column 2 of one of the items in the following table. The **_regulated activities _**of that person are as specified in column 3 of that item, and the **_relevant old legislation_** are as specified in column 4 of that item.

    * (2) Item 10 of the table in subsection (1) does not apply to a person and activities they carry on to the extent that the person's carrying on of any of those activities is in contravention of any of the provisions of the relevant old legislation for any of the other categories of regulated principals.

    * (3) If a person is a regulated principal of 2 or more different kinds, this Subdivision applies separately in relation to the person in their capacity as a regulated principal of each of those kinds.

        * Note: This may result (depending on what action the regulated principal takes) in a regulated principal having to comply with the relevant new legislation (within the meaning of subsection 1431(1)) in respect of their activities as a regulated principal of one kind, but, at the same time, having to comply with the relevant old legislation in respect of their activities as a regulated principal of another kind.

##### 1431  Parts 7.6, 7.7 and 7.8 of the amended Corporations Act generally do not apply to a regulated principal during the transition period

    * (1) Subject to subsections (2) and (3), Parts 7.6 (other than Subdivisions A and B of Division 4, and Division 5), 7.7 and 7.8 (other than section 992A) of the amended Corporations Act (the **_relevant new legislation_**) do not apply to a regulated principal and their regulated activities during the period (the **_transition period_**) starting on the FSR commencement and ending when the first of the following events occurs:

     * (a) the period of 2 years starting on the FSR commencement ends;

     * (b) the regulated principal is granted a licence under section 913B of the amended Corporations Act that covers their regulated activities;

     * (c) the regulated principal starts to be covered by an exemption under subsection 911A(2) of the amended Corporations Act (or would start to be so covered if that subsection applied) in respect of their regulated activities;

     * (d) the regulated principal ceases (for whatever reason) to have the status that made them a regulated principal.

    * For the purposes of paragraph (d), **_having a status _**includes holding a licence, registration, approval or other similar thing, or carrying on particular activities.

        * Note 1: Because of section 1441, a regulated principal whose transition period has not ended (and so who is not required to comply with the relevant new legislation) may nonetheless be required to comply with obligations under Part 7.9 of the amended Corporations Act.

        * Note 2: For the treatment of representatives, see section 1436.

    * (2) Division 5 of Part 7.6 of the amended Corporations Act has effect in relation to a regulated principal during the transition period subject to the following paragraphs:

     * (a) the regulated principal may give and revoke authorisations under section 916A or consents under subsection 916B(3) as if the regulated principal were a financial services licensee, however, for the purposes of the provisions of the amended Corporations Act outside that Division, such an authorisation or consent is taken not to have effect unless and until the regulated principal is granted a licence under section 913B of the amended Corporations Act that covers the activities to which the authorisation or consent relates (whether or not it also covers other activities);

     * (b) a person authorised by a section 916A authorisation so made by the regulated principal may give and revoke authorisations under subsection 916B(3) as if they were an authorised representative and the regulated principal were the authorising financial services licensee, however, for the purposes of the provisions of the amended Corporations Act outside that Division, such an authorisation is taken not to have effect unless and until the regulated principal is granted a licence under section 913B of the amended Corporations Act that covers the activities to which the authorisation relates (whether or not it also covers other activities);

     * (c) the regulated principal may give and revoke consents under section 916C as if they were a financial service licensee, however, any such consent does not take effect unless and until the regulated principal is granted a licence under section 913B of the amended Corporations Act;

     * (d) section 916F applies in relation to an authorisation so made by the regulated principal during the transition period as if the period of 15 business days referred to in subsections 916F(1) and (1A) did not start unless and until the regulated principal is granted a licence under section 913B of the amended Corporations Act that covers the activities to which the authorisation relates (whether or not it also covers other activities), and section 916F does not apply at all in relation to revocations so made during the transition period.

    * (3) If, before paragraph (1)(a) or (d) occurs:

     * (a) the regulated principal is granted a licence under section 913B of the amended Corporations Act that covers some only (the **_relevant part_**) of their regulated activities; or

     * (b) the regulated principal starts to be covered by an exemption under subsection 911A(2) of the amended Corporations Act in respect of some only (the **_relevant part_**) of their regulated activities;

    * the relevant new legislation starts applying, from that time, to the relevant part of the regulated principal's regulated activities, and subsection (1) continues to apply to the person as if the regulated principal's regulated activities did not include the relevant part.

    * (4) Subsection (3) has effect subject to subsection 1430(3).

##### 1432  Continued application of relevant old legislation

    * (1) Subject to subsection (2), during the transition period for a regulated principal, the relevant old legislation (if any) continues to apply, despite its repeal:

     * (a) to, and in relation to, the regulated principal and their regulated activities; and

     * (b) to any other person to whom it is expressed to apply, but only in relation to matters related to the regulated principal and their regulated activities.

        * Note: So, for example, people may continue to be appointed as agents or representatives of the regulated principal (or to have those appointments varied or revoked) during the transition period under provisions of the relevant old legislation that deal with such matters.

    * (2) If, because of subsection 1431(2), the relevant new legislation (within the meaning of subsection 1431(1)) starts to apply to part of a person's regulated activities from a particular time, the relevant old legislation (if any) stops applying, from that time, in relation to that part of those activities.

##### 1433  Streamlined licensing procedure for certain regulated principals

    * (1) This section applies to the following regulated principals:

     * (a) a regulated principal of a kind referred to in any of items 1 to 5 of the table in subsection 1430(1), but not including anyone who is:

      * (i) an exempted participant for the purposes of section 1419; or

      * (ii) in a class of persons specified in, or identified in accordance with, regulations made for the purposes of subsection (3);

     * (b) their application includes a statement (in accordance with the requirements of the application form) to the effect that they will, if granted the licence, comply with their obligations as a financial services licensee;

    * the following provisions apply: 

     * (c) section 913B of the amended Corporations Act applies to their application as if paragraphs 913B(1)(b), (c), (ca) and (d), and subsections 913B(2) to (5), were omitted; and

     * (d) the licence condition required by subsection 914A(6) of the amended Corporations Act in relation to a licence granted pursuant to their application must specify, as the financial services that the licensee is authorised to provide, financial services that equate (as closely as possible) to the regulated activities in respect of which the application was made.

        * Note 1: Paragraph (c) does not limit the matters that can be taken into account under section 915C (suspension or cancellation after offering a hearing) in relation to a licence that has been granted under section 913B as it applies because of this section.

        * Note 2: The condition referred to in paragraph (d), as with any other conditions imposed on the licence under section 914A of the amended Corporations Act, is subject to variation or revocation in accordance with that section.

    * (3) The regulations may identify classes of persons, or provide for the identification of classes of persons, who are not to be covered by this section.

##### 1434  Special licences for insurance multiagents during first 2 years after FSR commencement

    * (1) For the purposes of this section, a person is an **_insurance multiagent _**at a particular time if, at that time:

     * (b) the person has agreements with 2 or more different insurers under section 10 of that Act.

    * (2) If:

     * (a) a person who, immediately before the FSR commencement, is an insurance multiagent applies in accordance with section 913A of the amended Corporations Act for a licence, during the period of 2 years starting on the FSR commencement; and

     * (b) the application is lodged at a time:

      * (i) when the person is still carrying on activities as agent for one or more of the insurers with whom, immediately before the FSR commencement, they had agreements as mentioned in paragraph (1)(b); or

      * (ii) that is not more than 6 months after the person ceased to so carry on activities as agent for any of those insurers; and

     * (c) their application includes a statement (in accordance with the requirements of the application form) to the effect that they want this section to apply to their application;

    * the following provisions apply: 

     * (d) section 913B of the amended Corporations Act applies to their application as if the reference in paragraph 913B(1)(b) to section 912A did not include the obligations under paragraphs 912A(e) and (f);

     * (e) the licence condition required by subsection 914A(6) of the amended Corporations Act in relation to a licence granted pursuant to their application must specify, as the financial services that the licensee is authorised to provide:

      * (i) providing financial product advice in relation to risk insurance products and investment life insurance products; and

      * (ii) dealing in risk insurance products and investment life insurance products.

    * (3) If the application is granted, then:

     * (b) the licence conditions cannot be varied so that the licence covers the licensee providing financial services other than those referred to in paragraph (2)(e); and

     * (c) the licence ceases to be in force (unless earlier revoked) at the end of the period of 2 years starting on the FSR commencement.

##### 1435  Licensing decisions made within the first 2 years of the FSR commencement--regard may be had to conduct and experience of applicant or related body corporate that currently provides same or similar services

    * (1) This section applies:

     * (a) if a person applies, during the period of 2 years starting on the FSR commencement, under section 913A of the amended Corporations Act for the grant of a licence covering the provision of particular financial services (the **_relevant financial services_**); and

     * (b) ASIC is aware that:

      * (i) the applicant; or

      * (ii) if the applicant is a body corporate--a related body corporate of the applicant;

     * is currently (as at the time the application is being considered by ASIC) providing services that are the same as, or similar to, all or any of the relevant financial services.

    * (2) In considering the matters it is required by section 913B of the amended Corporations Act to consider in deciding whether to grant the licence, ASIC may (but is not required to) have regard to the conduct and experience (including conduct and experience before the FSR commencement) of the applicant, or the related body corporate, in providing services that are the same as, or similar to, all or any of the relevant financial services (so far as ASIC is aware of such conduct and experience).

    * (3) Subsection (2) is not intended to limit, by implication, the matters that ASIC can take into account under section 913B of the amended Corporations Act when considering whether to grant a licence under that section (whether pursuant to an application to which this section applies or otherwise).

##### 1436  Treatment of representatives--general

    * (1) This section applies to a person who is a representative of a regulated principal. For this purpose, a **_representative _**includes, but is not limited to:

     * (a) an agent (however described) of the regulated principal; and

     * (b) an employee or director of the regulated principal; and

     * (c) any other person who, in accordance with the regulated principal's relevant old legislation as it continues to have effect in relation to the regulated principal, is authorised to carry on activities for or on behalf of the regulated principal.

    * (1A) However, if a person who, under subsection (1), would be the representative of another person is a financial services licensee in their own right, the licensee, when engaged in activities covered by their licence, is taken not to be acting as representative of that other person.

    * (2) The following provisions apply in relation to a person who is a representative of a regulated principal:

     * (a) during any period when, because of section 1431, the relevant new legislation (within the meaning of subsection 1431(1)) does not apply to the regulated principal and particular regulated activities, the relevant new legislation also does not apply to the representative when they are acting as a representative of the regulated principal in relation to any of those activities;

     * (b) during any period when, because of section 1432, relevant old legislation continues to apply to the regulated principal and particular regulated activities, that legislation also continues to apply to the representative when they are acting as a representative of the regulated principal in relation to any of those activities.

        * Note 1: If a person is a representative of 2 persons, this may result in the person having to comply with the relevant new legislation in respect of what they do as a representative of one of those persons but, at the same time, having to comply with relevant old legislation in respect of what they do as a representative of the other of those persons.

        * Note 2: If a person is a representative of another person who carries on 2 different sets of activities, being sets of activities in relation to which there are separate applications of this Subdivision because of subsection 1430(3), this may result in the person having to comply with the relevant new legislation in respect of what they do in relation to one of those sets of activities but, at the same time, having to comply with relevant old legislation in respect of what they do in relation to the other set of activities.

        * Note 3: Because of section 1441, a representative who is not required to comply with the relevant new legislation may nonetheless be required to comply with obligations under Part 7.9 of the amended Corporations Act.

##### 1436A  Treatment of representatives--insurance agents

    * (1) This section has effect despite anything else in this Subdivision, including sections 1436 and 1437.

    * (2) This section applies if, immediately before the FSR commencement, a person is an insurance intermediary (but not an insurance broker) within the meaning of the _Insurance (Agents and Brokers) Act 1984 _as then in force because of an agreement they have with an insurer under section 10 of that Act. For the purposes of this section:

     * (a) the person is the **_insurance agent_**; and

     * (b) the agreement is the **_authorising agreement_**; and

     * (c) the matters dealt with in the provisions included in the agreement in compliance with section 10 of that Act, and any other matters included in the agreement that are related to those matters, are the **_relevant matters_**; and

     * (d) the insurer is the **_principal_**.

    * If, immediately before the FSR commencement, the person has more than one such agreement, this section applies separately in relation to each of those agreements.

    * (3) For the purposes of this section, the **_transition period _**is the period starting on the FSR commencement and ending when the first of the following events occurs:

     * (a) the period of 2 years starting on the FSR commencement ends;

     * (b) the authorising agreement ceases to be in force;

     * (c) the insurance agent has lodged with ASIC notice in writing that the agent no longer wants to be covered by the _Insurance (Agents and Brokers) Act 1984_:

      * (i) from a specified date, being a date that is after the notice is given to ASIC; or

      * (ii) from the end of a specified period, being a period that ends after the notice is given to ASIC;

     * and that date arrives or period ends;

     * (d) the insurance agent is granted a licence under section 913B (including as it has effect because of section 1434) of the amended Corporations Act that covers the insurance agent engaging in (as licensee) the range of activities that they previously engaged in as agent under the authorising agreement.

    * (4) A notice (the **_original notice_**) given for the purposes of paragraph (3)(c) may before the date, or the end of the period, specified in the original notice as mentioned in that paragraph:

     * (a) be varied to specify another date or period, being a date or period that would satisfy the requirements of subparagraph (3)(c)(i) or (ii) if the reference in that subparagraph to when the notice (being the original notice) is given to ASIC were instead a reference to when the notice of variation is given to ASIC under this subsection; or

     * (b) be revoked.

    * The variation or revocation must be made by notice in writing lodged with ASIC.

    * (5) Subject to subsection (7), during the transition period, the _Insurance (Agents and Brokers) Act 1984 _as in force immediately before the FSR commencement, and any associated provisions, (the **_relevant old legislation_**) continue to apply (despite the repeal of that Act) to, and in relation to, the insurance agent, the principal and the relevant matters.

    * (6) Subject to subsection (7), during the transition period, the relevant new legislation (within the meaning of section 1431) does not apply to, or in relation to, the insurance agent, the principal and the relevant matters.

    * (7) Regulations made for the purposes of this subsection may do either or both of the following:

     * (a) provide that specified provisions of the relevant old legislation apply (with or without specified modifications), or do not apply, to the insurance agent, the principal and some or all of the relevant matters;

     * (b) provide that specified provisions of the relevant new legislation apply (with or without specified modifications), or do not apply, to the insurance agent, the principal and some or all of the relevant matters.

    * The regulations may provide as mentioned in paragraph (a) or (b) even after the end of the transition period.

    * (8) If:

     * (a) before the end of the transition period, or such longer period during which regulations made for the purposes of subsection (7) provide for the application of some or all of the relevant old legislation, the insurance agent engages in conduct that, under the authorising agreement as then in force, creates a right to brokerage, commission or other remuneration (which may be a present right, or a future right that is dependent on matters specified in the authorising agreement); and

     * (b) that right is still in existence immediately before the end of that period;

    * the right is not taken to be brought to an end merely because of the repeal of the relevant old legislation or the enactment of the relevant new legislation, or because under this section the relevant old legislation ceases to apply and the relevant new legislation starts to apply.

    * (9) Subsection (8) is not intended to affect, in any way, the determination of the question whether any other right (whether or not it is under an agreement under section 10 of the _Insurance (Agents and Brokers) Act 1984_) is in any way affected by the provisions of the _Financial Services Reform Act 2001 _or the _Financial Services Reform (Consequential Provisions) Act 2001 _(including the amendments made by those Acts).
