    * Where the payer and payee of a registrable maintenance liability are the same as the payer and payee of another registrable maintenance liability (whether or not the liabilities arise under the same child support assessment, court order or maintenance agreement and whether or not the liabilities are in relation to the maintenance of the same person), the Registrar may include particulars of the liabilities in the same entry in the Child Support Register.

##### 28  Day on which liability first becomes enforceable under Act

##### 28B  Conversion of periodic amounts into payment rates in respect of payment periods

    * (1) The Registrar must convert a periodic amount payable under a registered maintenance liability arising under a court order or a maintenance agreement to:

      * (ii) fortnightly;

      * (iii) 4 weekly;

        * Note 1: For **_payment period_** see subsection 4(1).

        * Note 2: Sections 26A, 26B and 42A and Part IVA deal with the determination of the period, and the start day for the period, that may be entered in the Child Support Register under paragraph 26(2)(b).

##### 30  Effect of registration

    * (1) If a registrable maintenance liability is registered under this Act, amounts payable under the child support assessment, court order, maintenance agreement, maintenance order or maintenance assessment under which the liability arises are debts due to the Commonwealth by the payer in accordance with the particulars of the liability entered in the Child Support Register.

    * (2) In particular, the amounts are payable by the payer at the payment rate entered in the Register under paragraph 26(2)(d) in respect of the periods entered in the Register under paragraphs 26(2)(a) and (b).

        * Note: Section 28B requires the Registrar to convert the periodic amount payable in respect of a registrable maintenance liability to a rate of payment depending upon the payment period determined in respect of the liability.

    * (3) If a registrable maintenance liability is registered under this Act, the payee of the liability is not entitled to, and may not enforce payment of, amounts payable under the liability other than by instituting a proceeding under section 113A to recover a debt due in relation to the liability.

##### 30AA  Rule to avoid dual liabilities

    * (1) If:

     * (a) a registrable maintenance liability (the **_first liability_**) relating, in whole or in part, to a particular child, and also relating to a particular payer and a particular payee, is registered; and

     * (b) at any time after the registration of the first liability, a subsequent registrable maintenance liability relating, in whole or in part, to the same child, and also relating to the same payer and the same payee, is registered;

    * the first liability ceases, at the time the subsequent liability is registered, to have effect to the extent only that it relates to the particular child.

    * (2) Despite subsection (1), the first liability is treated, for the sole purpose of facilitating the recovery of arrears in respect of any period ending on or before it ceases to have effect, as if it had not ceased to have effect as provided in subsection (1).

##### 30A  Enforcement of Australian liabilities overseas

    * (1) A payee may apply to the Registrar to have a maintenance order or agreement, or a child support assessment, enforced in a reciprocating jurisdiction (other than an excepted reciprocating jurisdiction in relation to such an order, agreement or assessment).

    * (2) For the purpose of having a maintenance order or agreement, or a child support assessment, enforced in a reciprocating jurisdiction (other than an excepted reciprocating jurisdiction in relation to such an order, agreement or assessment) the Registrar may, at any time, and must, as soon as practicable after a payee makes an application under subsection (1):

     * (a) request, in writing, a judicial or administrative authority in the reciprocating jurisdiction to enforce the liability; and

     * (b) in a case where there is an application by a payee under subsection (1)--give the application to the authority; and

     * (c) give the authority such other documentation and information as is required by the authority for enforcement proceedings in that jurisdiction.

    * (3) Without limiting the generality of paragraph (2)(c), the Registrar must give to the judicial or administrative authority a certificate signed by the Registrar stating the amounts that are due or payable under the liability.

    * (4) In this section:

    * **_excepted reciprocating jurisdiction_**, in relation to a maintenance order or agreement, or a child support assessment, means a reciprocating jurisdiction that is declared by the regulations to be an excepted reciprocating jurisdiction in respect of such an order, agreement or assessment.

    * (5) For the purposes of subsection (4), a jurisdiction may be declared to be an excepted reciprocating jurisdiction, in relation to a maintenance order or agreement, or a child support assessment, only if the enforcement in the jurisdiction of such an order, agreement or assessment would not be permitted by the law of the jurisdiction.

    * (6) A request under subsection (2) is not a legislative instrument.

##### 31  Effect of registration on existing garnishment and attachment of earnings orders

    * Where, on the day on which a registered maintenance liability first becomes enforceable under this Act or again becomes enforceable under this Act, a garnishment or attachment of earnings order made by a court under the _Family Law Act 1975_, the _Matrimonial Causes Act 1959 _or the law of a State or Territory is in force in relation to the liability, the order ceases to have effect in so far as it relates to amounts payable under the liability in relation to the child support enforcement period.

     * (a) is in receipt of a social security pension or a social security benefit; or

    * Nonenforcement of liability--variation of Child Support Register

    * (6) If a lowincome nonenforcement period in relation to a registered maintenance liability begins, the Registrar must, as soon as practicable, vary the particulars entered in the Child Support Register in relation to the liability by specifying the beginning of the lowincome nonenforcement period as the time at which the liability ceases to be enforceable under this Act. However, this rule does not apply if, immediately before the lowincome nonenforcement period, the liability had already ceased to be enforceable under this Act because of section 38A, 38B or 39B.

     * (b) if the payee, or the payee and payer jointly, have elected to have amounts payable under the liability in relation to the child support enforcement period that are unpaid on the terminating day also no longer enforced under this Act--vary the particulars so as to ensure that, in spite of section 30, those amounts cease to be debts due by the payer to the Commonwealth.

    * (3A) However, if either the payer or the payee is a resident of a reciprocating jurisdiction, the Registrar has 90 days to vary the relevant particulars, instead of 28 days.

    * (4) The Registrar must not make a variation under paragraph (3)(a) by specifying a day that is included in a period that is a lowincome nonenforcement period under section 37B in relation to the liability. If that day is included in that period, the Registrar must not take action under paragraph (3)(b) in relation to that day.

    * (3) If, before the day specified in a variation under subsection (2), the Registrar decides to revoke the decision that gave rise to the variation, the Registrar must vary the particulars concerned in the Child Support Register to give effect to the revocation.

    * (4) The revocation takes effect on the day the Registrar varies the particulars concerned.

##### 38C  Election not to enforce--registered maintenance liability

    * (1) If a registered maintenance liability of a kind mentioned in section 18A is not enforceable because of an election under section 38A, an amount unpaid under the relevant maintenance assessment, order or agreement is a debt due and payable by the payer to the payee.

    * (2) A debt due under this section is recoverable by the payee from the payer in a court of competent jurisdiction.

##### 39  Application for variation to enable liability to again become enforceable under Act

    * (1) If a registered maintenance liability is not enforceable under this Act because of an election made under section 38A or a decision by the Registrar under section 38B, the payee may apply to the Registrar for the liability to again become enforceable under this Act.

    * (5) The Registrar must grant the application unless the Registrar is satisfied that:

     * (a) the payer of the liability has been complying with his or her child support obligations in relation to the payee; or

     * (b) the payer of the liability has satisfactorily explained and rectified a failure to comply with his or her child support obligations in relation to a payee; or

     * (c) there are special circumstances that exist in relation to the liability that make it appropriate to refuse the application.

     * (b) in respect of each debt, the Commonwealth would be required, under section 76, to pay the amount paid by one of the persons to the other person; and

     * (c) for a debt that arose from a liability referred to in section 17--the liability provided for child support for a child of the 2 persons;

    * the Registrar may offset the debts by deducting the amount, or part of the amount, of the debt of the person who owes the lesser amount from the amount of the debt of the person who owes the greater amount.

    * (2) If the amount of the debts is the same, the Registrar may offset one debt against the other. In this case, the Commonwealth is taken to have recovered both of the debts.

    * (3) If the amount of the debts is not the same, the Commonwealth is taken to have recovered:

     * (a) so much of the amount of the smaller debt as is offset against the larger debt; and

     * (b) so much of the amount of the larger debt that equals the amount of the smaller debt as is offset.

    * (4) Any amounts recovered by the Commonwealth by way of offset are taken to be:

     * (a) paid by the payer to the Registrar under the registered maintenance liability concerned; and

     * (b) paid by the Commonwealth to the payee as provided for in this Act.

        * Example: Offset of part of a debt

        *  was previously the payer of a registrable maintenance liability. 's children have now come to live with her.  has the greater debt of $3,000 from the period when she was a child support payer. Even though the children are no longer living with Theo, he is entitled to $3,000 in child support when  pays it.

        * Theo has now been assessed as having a child support liability. Under that liability, Theo has a debt of $150 in respect of a calendar month.

        * The Registrar offsets $100 of the debt (part of it only) that became due and payable by Theo against the amount owed by . The effect of the offset is that  is taken to have paid $100 per calendar month. Theo is taken to have paid $100 of his liability to pay $150. Under the liability, Theo must pay $50 for that calendar month.

        * Each time a debt incurred by Theo under the liability becomes due and payable it may be offset against the remainder of 's debt.

        * Note: Section 16A provides for the Registrar to specify the manner in which an application may be made.

    * (2) If:

     * (a) the application referred to in paragraph (1)(b) specifies that the amount, or part of the amount, received by the third party is to be credited against a specified percentage (that is less than 100%) of the amount payable under the liability; and

     * (b) the Registrar is satisfied that the payer and the payee agree that the amount received is to be so credited;

    * then the Registrar must credit the amount, or the part of the amount, received against that percentage of the amount payable under the liability.

    * (3) Otherwise, the Registrar must credit the amount, or the part of the amount, received against all of the amount payable under the liability.

    * (4) This section does not apply to an enforceable maintenance liability of a kind referred to in paragraph 18A(3)(a).
