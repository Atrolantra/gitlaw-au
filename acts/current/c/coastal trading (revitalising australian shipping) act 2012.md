### An Act to regulate coastal trading, and for related purposes

### Part 1--Preliminary

##### 1  Short title

    * This Act may be cited as the _Coastal Trading (Revitalising Australian Shipping) Act 2012_.

##### 2  Commencement

    * This Act commences on 1 July 2012.

##### 3  Object of Act

    * (1) The object of this Act is to provide a regulatory framework for coastal trading in Australia that:

     * (a) promotes a viable shipping industry that contributes to the broader Australian economy; and

     * (b) facilitates the long term growth of the Australian shipping industry; and

     * (c) enhances the efficiency and reliability of Australian shipping as part of the national transport system; and

     * (d) maximises the use of vessels registered in the Australian General Shipping Register in coastal trading; and

     * (e) promotes competition in coastal trading; and

     * (f) ensures efficient movement of passengers and cargo between Australian ports.

    * (2) This Act aims to achieve its object by the following means:

     * (a) ensuring that a vessel that is used to engage in coastal trading under a general licence has unrestricted access to Australian waters;

     * (b) ensuring that a vessel that is used to engage in coastal trading has access to Australian waters under a temporary licence that is limited in time and to voyages authorised by the licence;

     * (c) ensuring that a vessel that is used to engage in coastal trading under an emergency licence has the access to Australian waters required to deal with the emergency to which the licence relates.

##### 4  Constitutional basis for Act

    * (1) Without limiting its effect apart from this section, this Act applies to activities of, or matters that relate to, the following:

     * (a) a vessel engaged in trade and commerce:

      * (i) among the States; or

      * (ii) between a State and a Territory; or

      * (iii) between 2 Territories;

     * (b) a vessel that is external to Australia;

     * (c) a vessel of which the owner, or any of the owners, is a constitutional corporation;

     * (d) a vessel, so far as the application of this Act to activities of, or in relation to, the vessel is reasonably appropriate and adapted to giving effect to Australia's obligations under an international agreement;

     * (e) a vessel of which the owner, or any of the owners, is the Commonwealth or a Commonwealth agency;

     * (f) navigation or shipping, to the extent that the navigation or shipping relates to trade and commerce:

      * (i) among the States; or

      * (ii) between a State and a Territory; or

      * (iii) between 2 Territories;

     * (g) things that are incidental to activities or matters referred to in any of the above paragraphs.

    * (2) For the purposes of subsection (1), an activity of, or a matter that relates to, a vessel includes, but is not limited to, an activity done by a person, or in relation to a person, in the capacity of owner of the vessel or seafarer working on the vessel.

    * (3) For the purposes of subsection (1), **_external to Australia_** means:

     * (a) beyond the baseline from which the breadth of the territorial sea is measured under section 7 of the _Seas and Submerged Lands Act 1973_; or

     * (b) any waters on the landward side of the territorial sea that are not within the limits of a State or internal Territory.

        * Note: For the baseline see _Australia's territorial sea baseline_ (AGPS) 1988: generally the baseline is the lowest astronomical tide along the coast but it also includes lines enclosing bays and indentations that are not bays and straight baselines that depart from the coast.

##### 5  Simplified outline

    * The following is a simplified outline of this Act: 

     *  	This Act regulates coastal trading by providing for licences to be granted that authorise vessels to carry passengers or cargo between ports in Australia. Using a vessel to engage in coastal trading without a licence may lead to a pecuniary penalty being imposed for the contravention of a civil penalty provision.

     *  	Part 2 contains definitions for the Act, including a definition of **_coastal trading_** and **_voyage_**.

     *  	Part 3 contains provisions relating to the application of the Act to various kinds of vessels, including provisions allowing the Minister to grant exemptions from the Act for vessels and people.

     *  	Part 4 sets out the 3 kinds of licences (general licences, temporary licences and emergency licences) that may be granted and the application process for each. It also deals with matters such as conditions of licences and the cancellation of licences.

     *  	Part 5 contains provisions relating to the enforcement of the Act.

     *  	Part 6 deals with miscellaneous matters such as the review of certain decisions by the Administrative Appeals Tribunal and the delegation of the Minister's and Secretary's functions and powers under the Act.

    * (1) If an act or thing is required under a civil penalty provision to be done:

     * (a) within a particular period; or

     * (a) within a particular period; or

     * (b) before a particular time;

    * commits a separate contravention of that provision in respect of each day during which the contravention occurs (including the day the relevant civil penalty order is made or any later day).

##### 95  Mistake of fact

    * (1) A person is not liable to have a civil penalty order made against the person for a contravention of a civil penalty provision if:

     * (a) at or before the time of the conduct constituting the contravention, the person:

      * (i) considered whether or not facts existed; and

      * (ii) was under a mistaken but reasonable belief about those facts; and

     * (b) had those facts existed, the conduct would not have constituted a contravention of the civil penalty provision.

    * (2) For the purposes of subsection (1), a person may be regarded as having considered whether or not facts existed if:

     * (a) the person had considered, on a previous occasion, whether those facts existed in the circumstances surrounding that occasion; and

     * (b) the person honestly and reasonably believed that the circumstances surrounding the present occasion were the same, or substantially the same, as those surrounding the previous occasion.

    * (3) A person who wishes to rely on subsection (1) or (2) in proceedings for a civil penalty order bears an evidential burden in relation to that matter.

     * (d) the officer failed to take all reasonable steps to prevent the contravention.

    * (2) The civil penalty for a contravention of subsection (1) is the civil penalty that a Court could impose in respect of an individual for the civil penalty provision contravened by the body corporate.

##### 99  Establishing whether an executive officer took reasonable steps to prevent the contravention of a civil penalty provision

    * (1) For the purposes of section 98, in determining whether an executive officer of a body corporate failed to take all reasonable steps to prevent the contravention of a civil penalty provision, a court is to have regard to:

     * (a) what action (if any) the officer took towards ensuring that the body's employees, agents and contractors have a reasonable knowledge and understanding of the requirements to comply with this Act, in so far as those requirements affect the employees, agents or contractors concerned; and

     * (b) what action (if any) the officer took when he or she became aware that the body was contravening this Act.
