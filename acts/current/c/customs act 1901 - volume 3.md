### Part XVB--Special provisions relating to antidumping duties

##### 269SM  Overview of Part

    * (1) This Part deals with the taking of antidumping measures in respect of goods whose importation into  involves a dumping or countervailable subsidisation of those goods that injures, or threatens to injure, Australian industry. Those measures might consist of the publication of a dumping duty notice or a countervailing duty notice or the acceptance of an undertaking on conditions that make it unnecessary to publish such a notice.

    * (2) If a notice is published, that notice creates a liability under the Dumping Duty Act, in relation to any goods to which the notice extends, to pay a special duty of customs on their importation into  and, pending assessment of that special duty, to pay interim duty.

    * (2A) Division 1A deals with the establishment of the AntiDumping Commission and the Commissioner.

    * (3) Divisions 1, 2 and 3 deal with the preliminary and procedural matters leading to a Ministerial decision to publish or not to publish a dumping duty notice or a countervailing duty notice or to accept an undertaking instead of publishing such a notice.

    * (4) Division 4 allows a person who has been required to pay interim duty to seek an assessment of duty payable under the Dumping Duty Act and reconciles interim duty paid by that person with duty as so assessed.

    * (5) Division 5 deals with the rights of persons, periodically, on the basis of changed circumstances, to seek review by the Minister of decisions to publish dumping duty notices or countervailing duty notices or to accept undertakings. 

    * (5A) Division 5A deals with the rights of persons to ask the Commissioner to conduct an anticircumvention inquiry in relation to certain dumping duty notices or countervailing duty notices.

    * (6) Division 6 deals with the rights of new exporters to seek an early review by the Minister of decisions to publish dumping duty notices or countervailing duty notices.

    * (7) Division 6A ensures that interested parties are informed of the impending expiration of antidumping measures and allows them to seek continuation of those measures.

    * (8) Division 7 deals with procedural and evidentiary matters that are relevant both to applications for the taking of antidumping measures and for the various review procedures after such measures are taken.

    * (9) Divisions 8 and 9 establish an independent panel, the Review Panel, and provide for the Panel to review a range of Ministerial decisions (including decisions to publish or not to publish dumping duty notices or countervailing duty notices) and also a range of decisions made by the Commissioner.

##### 269TAAC  Definition--countervailable subsidy

    * (1) For the purposes of this Part, a subsidy is a **_countervailable subsidy_** if it is specific.

    * (2) Without limiting the generality of the circumstances in which a subsidy is specific, a subsidy is specific:

     * (a) if, subject to subsection (3), access to the subsidy is explicitly limited to particular enterprises; or

     * (b) if, subject to subsection (3), access is limited to particular enterprises carrying on business within a designated geographical region that is within the jurisdiction of the subsidising authority; or

     * (a) the fact that the subsidy program benefits a limited number of particular enterprises; or

     * (b) the fact that the subsidy program predominantly benefits particular enterprises; or

     * (c) the fact that particular enterprises have access to disproportionately large amounts of the subsidy; or

     * (d) the manner in which a discretion to grant access to the subsidy has been exercised;

    * determine that the subsidy is specific.

    * (5) In making a determination under subsection (4), the Minister must take account of:

     * (a) the extent of diversification of economic activities within the jurisdiction of the subsidising authority; and

      * (ii) there is a review under Division 5 in relation to the publication of a countervailing duty notice;

      * (iii) there is an inquiry under Division 6A in relation to the continuation of a countervailing duty notice; and

     * (b) the Commissioner is satisfied that an entity covered by subsection (2):

      * (i) has not given the Commissioner information the Commissioner considers to be relevant to the investigation, review or inquiry within a period the Commissioner considers to be reasonable; or

      * (ii) has significantly impeded the investigation, review or inquiry;

    * then, in relation to the investigation, review or inquiry, in determining whether a countervailable subsidy has been received in respect of particular goods, or in determining the amount of a countervailable subsidy in respect of particular goods, the Commissioner or the Minister:

     * (c) may act on the basis of all the facts available to the Commissioner or the Minister (as the case may be); and

     * (d) may make such assumptions as the Commissioner or the Minister (as the case may be) considers reasonable.

    * (2) For the purposes of paragraph (1)(b), the entities are as follows:

     * (a) any person who is or is likely to be directly concerned with the importation or exportation into Australia of goods to which the investigation, review or inquiry relates or who has been or is likely to be directly concerned with the importation or exportation into Australia of like goods;

     * (b) the government of the country of export or country of origin:

      * (i) of goods to which the investigation, review or inquiry relates that have been, or are likely to be, exported to ; or

##### 269TAAD  Ordinary course of trade

    * (1) If the Minister is satisfied, in relation to goods exported to :

     * (a) that like goods are sold in the country of export in sales that are arms length transactions in substantial quantities during an extended period:

      * (i) for home consumption in the country of export; or

      * (ii) for exportation to a third country;

     * at a price that is less than the cost of such goods; and

     * (b) that it is unlikely that the seller of the goods will be able to recover the cost of such goods within a reasonable period;

    * the price paid for the goods referred to in paragraph (a) is taken not to have been paid in the ordinary course of trade.

    * (2) For the purposes of this section, sales of goods at a price that is less than the cost of such goods are taken to have occurred in substantial quantities during an extended period if the volume of sales of such goods at a price below the cost of such goods over that period is not less than 20% of the total volume of sales over that period.

    * (3) Costs of goods are taken to be recoverable within a reasonable period of time if, although the selling price of those goods at the time of their sale is below their cost at that time, the selling price is above the weighted average cost of such goods over the investigation period.

    * (4) The cost of goods is worked out by adding:

     * (a) the amount determined by the Minister to be the cost of production or manufacture of those goods in the country of export; and

     * (b) the amount determined by the Minister to be the administrative, selling and general costs associated with the sale of those goods.

    * (5) Amounts determined by the Minister for the purposes of paragraphs (4)(a) and (b) must be worked out in such manner, and taking account of such factors, as the regulations provide in respect of those purposes.

     * (b) the price appears to be influenced by a commercial or other relationship between the buyer, or an associate of the buyer, and the seller, or an associate of the seller; or

     * (c) in the opinion of the Minister the buyer, or an associate of the buyer, will, subsequent to the purchase or sale, directly or indirectly, be reimbursed, be compensated or otherwise receive a benefit for, or in respect of, the whole or any part of the price.

    * (1A) For the purposes of paragraph (1)(c), the Minister must not hold the opinion referred to in that paragraph because of a reimbursement in respect of the purchase or sale if the Minister is of the opinion that the purchase or sale will remain an arms length transaction in spite of the payment of that reimbursement, having regard to any or all of the following matters:

     * (a) any agreement, or established trading practices, in relation to the seller and the buyer, in respect of the reimbursement;

     * (b) the period for which such an agreement or practice has been in force;

     * (c) whether or not the amount of the reimbursement is quantifiable at the time of the purchase or sale.

    * (2) Without limiting the generality of subsection (1), where:

     * (a) goods are exported to  otherwise than by the importer and are purchased by the importer from the exporter (whether before or after exportation) for a particular price; and

     * (b) the Minister is satisfied that the importer, whether directly or through an associate or associates, sells those goods in  (whether in the condition in which they were imported or otherwise) at a loss;

    * the Minister may, for the purposes of paragraph (1)(c), treat the sale of those goods at a loss as indicating that the importer or an associate of the importer will, directly or indirectly, be reimbursed, be compensated or otherwise receive a benefit for, or in respect of, the whole or a part of the price.

    * (3) In determining, for the purposes of subsection (2), whether goods are sold by an importer at a loss, the Minister shall have regard to:

     * (a) the amount of the price paid or to be paid for the goods by the importer; and

     * (b) such other amounts as the Minister determines to be costs necessarily incurred in the importation and sale of the goods; and

     * (c) the likelihood that the amounts referred to in paragraphs (a) and (b) will be able to be recovered within a reasonable time; and

     * (d) such other matters as the Minister considers relevant.

    * (4) For the purposes of this Part, 2 persons shall be deemed to be associates of each other if, and only if:

     * (a) both being natural persons:

      * (i) they are members of the same family; or

      * (ii) one of them is an officer or director of a body corporate controlled, directly or indirectly, by the other;

     * (a) where:

      * (i) the goods have been exported to  otherwise than by the importer and have been purchased by the importer from the exporter (whether before or after exportation); and

      * (ii) the purchase of the goods by the importer was an arms length transaction;

     * the price paid or payable for the goods by the importer, other than any part of that price that represents a charge in respect of the transport of the goods after exportation or in respect of any other matter arising after exportation; or

     * (b) where:

      * (i) the goods have been exported to  otherwise than by the importer and have been purchased by the importer from the exporter (whether before or after exportation); and

      * (ii) the purchase of the goods by the importer was not an arms length transaction; and

      * (iii) the goods are subsequently sold by the importer, in the condition in which they were imported, to a person who is not an associate of the importer;

     * the price at which the goods were so sold by the importer to that person less the prescribed deductions; or

     * (c) in any other case--the price that the Minister determines having regard to all the circumstances of the exportation.

    * (1A) For the purposes of paragraph (1)(a), the reference in that paragraph to the price paid or payable for goods is a reference to that price after deducting any amount that is determined by the Minister to be a reimbursement of the kind referred to in subsection 269TAA(1A) in respect of that transaction.

    * (2) A reference in paragraph (1)(b) to prescribed deductions in relation to a sale of goods that have been exported to  shall be read as a reference to:

     * (a) any duties of Customs or sales tax paid or payable on the goods; and

     * (b) any costs, charges or expenses arising in relation to the goods after exportation; and

     * (c) the profit, if any, on the sale by the importer or, where the Minister so directs, an amount calculated in accordance with such rate as the Minister specifies in the direction as the rate that, for the purposes of paragraph (1)(b), is to be regarded as the rate of profit on the sale by the importer.

    * (3) Where the Minister is satisfied that sufficient information has not been furnished, or is not available, to enable the export price of goods to be ascertained under the preceding subsections, the export price of those goods shall be such amount as is determined by the Minister having regard to all relevant information.

    * (4) For the purposes of this section, the Minister may disregard any information that he or she considers to be unreliable.

    * (5) Paragraphs (1)(a) and (b) apply in relation to a purchase of goods by an importer from an exporter whether or not the importer and exporter are associates of each other.

##### 269TAC   value of goods

    * (1) Subject to this section, for the purposes of this Part, the normal value of any goods exported to Australia is the price paid or payable for like goods sold in the ordinary course of trade for home consumption in the country of export in sales that are arms length transactions by the exporter or, if like goods are not so sold by the exporter, by other sellers of like goods.

    * (1A) For the purposes of subsection (1), the reference in that subsection to the price paid or payable for like goods is a reference to that price after deducting any amount that is determined by the Minister to be a reimbursement of the kind referred to in subsection 269TAA(1A) in respect of the sales.

    * (2) Subject to this section, where the Minister:

     * (a) is satisfied that:

      * (i) because of the absence, or low volume, of sales of like goods in the market of the country of export that would be relevant for the purpose of determining a price under subsection (1); or

      * (ii) because the situation in the market of the country of export is such that sales in that market are not suitable for use in determining a price under subsection (1);

     * the normal value of goods exported to  cannot be ascertained under subsection (1); or

     * (b) is satisfied, in a case where like goods are not sold in the ordinary course of trade for home consumption in the country of export in sales that are arms length transactions by the exporter, that it is not practicable to obtain, within a reasonable time, information in relation to sales by other sellers of like goods that would be relevant for the purpose of determining a price under subsection (1);

    * the normal value of the goods for the purposes of this Part is: 

     * (c) except where paragraph (d) applies, the sum of:

      * (i) such amount as the Minister determines to be the cost of production or manufacture of the goods in the country of export; and

      * (ii) on the assumption that the goods, instead of being exported, had been sold for home consumption in the ordinary course of trade in the country of export--such amounts as the Minister determines would be the administrative, selling and general costs associated with the sale and the profit on that sale; or

     * (d) if the Minister directs that this paragraph applies--the price determined by the Minister to be the price paid or payable for like goods sold in the ordinary course of trade in arms length transactions for exportation from the country of export to a third country determined by the Minister to be an appropriate third country, other than any amount determined by the Minister to be a reimbursement of the kind referred to in subsection 269TAA(1A) in respect of any such transactions.

    * (3) The price determined under paragraph (2)(d) is a price that the Minister determines, having regard to the quantity of like goods sold as described in paragraph (2)(d) at that price, is representative of the price paid in such sales.

    * (4) Subject to subsections (6) and (8), where the Minister is satisfied that it is inappropriate to ascertain the normal value of goods in accordance with the preceding subsections because the Government of the country of export:

     * (a) has a monopoly, or substantial monopoly, of the trade of the country; and

     * (b) determines or substantially influences the domestic price of goods in that country;

    * the normal value of the goods for the purposes of this Part is to be a value ascertained in accordance with whichever of the following paragraphs the Minister determines having regard to what is appropriate and reasonable in the circumstances of the case: 

     * (c) a value equal to the price of like goods produced or manufactured in a country determined by the Minister and sold for home consumption in the ordinary course of trade in that country, being sales that are arms length transactions;

     * (d) a value equal to the price determined by the Minister to be the price of like goods produced or manufactured in a country determined by the Minister and sold in the ordinary course of trade in arms length transactions for exportation from that country to a third country determined by the Minister to be an appropriate third country;

     * (e) a value equal to the sum of the following amounts ascertained in respect of like goods produced or manufactured in a country determined by the Minister and sold for home consumption in the ordinary course of trade in that country:

      * (i) such amount as the Minister determines to be the cost of production or manufacture of the like goods in that country;

      * (ii) such amounts as the Minister determines to be the administrative, selling and general costs associated with the sale of like goods in that country and the profit on that sale;

     * (f) a value equal to the price payable for like goods produced or manufactured in  and sold for home consumption in the ordinary course of trade in , being sales that are arms length transactions.

    * (5) The price determined under paragraph (4)(d) is a price that the Minister determines, because of the quantity of like goods sold as described in paragraph (4)(d) at that price, is representative of the price paid in such sales.

    * (5A) Amounts determined:

     * (a) to be the cost of production or manufacture of goods under subparagraph (2)(c)(i) or (4)(e)(i); and

     * (b) to be the administrative, selling and general costs in relation to goods under subparagraph (2)(c)(ii) or (4)(e)(ii);

    * must be worked out in such manner, and taking account of such factors, as the regulations provide for the respective purposes of paragraphs 269TAAD(4)(a) and (b).

    * (5B) The amount determined to be the profit on the sale of goods under subparagraph (2)(c)(ii) or (4)(e)(ii), must be worked out in such manner, and taking account of such factors, as the regulations provide for that purpose.

    * (5C) Without limiting the generality of the matters that may be taken into account by the Minister in determining whether a third country is an appropriate third country for the purposes of paragraph (2)(d) or (4)(d), the Minister may have regard to the following matters:

     * (a) whether the volume of trade from the country of export referred to in paragraph (2)(d) or the country firstmentioned in paragraph (4)(d) is similar to the volume of trade from the country of export to Australia; and

     * (b) whether the nature of the trade in goods concerned between the country of export referred to in paragraph (2)(d) or the country firstmentioned in paragraph (4)(d) is similar to the nature of trade between the country of export and .

    * (5D) The normal value of goods (the **_exported goods_**) is the amount determined by the Minister, having regard to all relevant information, if the exported goods are exported to Australia and the Minister is satisfied that the country of export has an economy in transition and that at least one of the following paragraphs applies:

     * (a) both of the following conditions exist:

      * (i) the exporter of the exported goods sells like goods in the country of export;

      * (ii) market conditions do not prevail in that country in respect of the domestic selling price of those like goods;

     * (b) both of the following conditions exist:

      * (i) the exporter of the exported goods does not sell like goods in the country of export but others do;

      * (ii) market conditions do not prevail in that country in respect of the domestic selling price of those like goods;

     * (c) the exporter of the exported goods does not answer questions in a questionnaire given to the exporter by the Commissioner under subsection 269TC(8) within the period described in that subsection or subsection 269TC(9) for answering questions;

     * (d) the answers given within the period mentioned in subsection 269TC(8), or the further period mentioned in subsection 269TC(9), by the exporter of the exported goods to a questionnaire given to the exporter under subsection 269TC(8) do not provide a reasonable basis for determining that paragraphs (a) and (b) of this subsection do not apply.

         * Note: Subsection 269TC(8) deals with the Commissioner giving an exporter of goods to Australia a questionnaire about evidence of whether or not paragraphs (a) and (b) of this subsection apply, with a specified period of at least 30 days for the exporter to answer the questions. Under subsection 269TC(9) the Commissioner may allow the exporter a further period for answering the questions.

    * (5E) To be satisfied that the conditions in paragraph (5D)(a) or (b) exist, the Minister must have regard to the matters (if any) prescribed by the regulations.

    * (5F) Without limiting the generality of subsection (5D), for the purpose of working out, under that subsection, the amount that is to be the normal value of goods exported to Australia, the Minister may determine that amount in a manner that would be open to the Minister under paragraph (4)(c), (d), (e) or (f) if subsection (4) were applicable.

    * (5J) For the purposes of fulfilling 's international obligations under an international agreement, regulations may be made to disapply subsection (5D) to a country.

    * (6) Where the Minister is satisfied that sufficient information has not been furnished or is not available to enable the normal value of goods to be ascertained under the preceding subsections (other than subsection (5D)), the normal value of those goods is such amount as is determined by the Minister having regard to all relevant information.

    * (7) For the purposes of this section, the Minister may disregard any information that he or she considers to be unreliable.

    * (7A) The application of subsection (5D) to goods that are exported to  from a particular country does not preclude the application of other provisions of this section (other than subsections (4) and (5)) to other goods that are exported to  from that country.

    * (8) Where the normal value of goods exported to  is the price paid or payable for like goods and that price and the export price of the goods exported:

     * (a) relate to sales occurring at different times; or

     * (b) are not in respect of identical goods; or

     * (c) are modified in different ways by taxes or the terms or circumstances of the sales to which they relate;

    * that price paid or payable for like goods is to be taken to be such a price adjusted in accordance with directions by the Minister so that those differences would not affect its comparison with that export price.

    * (9) Where the normal value of goods exported to Australia is to be ascertained in accordance with paragraph (2)(c) or (4)(e), the Minister must make such adjustments, in determining the costs to be determined under that paragraph, as are necessary to ensure that the normal value so ascertained is properly comparable with the export price of those goods.

    * (10) Where:

     * (a) the actual country of export of goods exported to  is not the country of origin of the goods; and

     * (b) the Minister is of the opinion that the normal value of the goods should be ascertained for the purposes of this Part as if the country of origin were the country of export;

    * he or she may direct that the normal value of the goods is to be so ascertained.

    * (11) For the purposes of subsection (10), the country of origin of goods is:

     * (a) in the case of unmanufactured raw products--the country of which they are products; or

     * (b) in any other case--the country in which the last significant process in the manufacture or production of the goods was performed.

    * (14) If:

     * (a) application is made for a dumping duty notice; and

     * (b) goods the subject of the application are exported to ; but

     * (c) the volume of sales of like goods for home consumption in the country of export by the exporter or another seller of like goods is less than 5% of the volume of goods the subject of the application that are exported to Australia by the exporter;

    * the volume of sales referred to in paragraph (c) is taken, for the purposes of paragraph (2)(a), to be a low volume unless the Minister is satisfied that it is still large enough to permit a proper comparison for the purposes of assessing a dumping margin under section 269TACB.

##### 269TACAA  Sampling

    * (1) If:

     * (a) one of the following applies:

      * (i) there is an investigation under this Part in relation to whether a dumping duty notice or countervailing duty notice should be published;

     * (c) who constitute a statistically valid sample of those exporters; or

     * (d) who are responsible for the largest volume of exports to  that can reasonably be examined.

    * (2) If information is submitted by an exporter not initially selected under subsection (1) for the purposes of an investigation, review or inquiry, the investigation, review or inquiry must extend to that exporter unless to so extend it would prevent its timely completion.

     * (a) that there is no dumping; or

     * (b) that the dumping margin, when expressed as a percentage of the export price or weighted average of export prices used to establish that dumping margin, is less than 2%.

     * (d) if the goods are the subject of, or of an application for, a third country countervailing duty notice under subsection 269TK(1) or (2)--to prevent the injury, or a recurrence of the injury, referred to in paragraph 269TK(1)(b) or (2)(b).

##### 269TACB  Working out whether dumping has occurred and levels of dumping 

    * (1) If:

     * (a) application is made for a dumping duty notice; and

     * (b) export prices in respect of goods the subject of the application exported to Australia during the investigation period have been established in accordance with section 269TAB; and

     * (c) corresponding normal values in respect of like goods during that period have been established in accordance with section 269TAC;

    * the Minister must determine, by comparison of those export prices with those normal values, whether dumping has occurred.

    * (2) In order to compare those export prices with those normal values, the Minister may, subject to subsection (3):

     * (a) compare the weighted average of export prices over the whole of the investigation period with the weighted average of corresponding normal values over the whole of that period; or

     * (aa) use the method of comparison referred to in paragraph (a) in respect of parts of the investigation period as if each of these parts were the whole of the investigation period; or

     * (b) compare the export prices determined in respect of individual transactions over the whole of the investigation period with the corresponding normal values determined over the whole of that period; or

     * (c) use:

      * (i) the method of comparison referred to in paragraph (a) in respect of a part or parts of the investigation period as if the part or each of these parts were the whole of the investigation period; and

      * (ii) the method of comparison referred to in paragraph (b) in respect of another part or other parts of the investigation period as if that other part or each of these other parts were the whole of the investigation period.

    * (2A) If paragraph (2)(aa) or (c) applies:

     * (a) each part of the investigation period referred to in the paragraph must not be less than 2 months; and

     * (b) the parts of the investigation period as referred to in paragraph (2)(aa), or as referred to in subparagraphs (2)(c)(i) and (ii), must together comprise the whole of the investigation period.

    * (3) If the Minister is satisfied:

     * (a) that the export prices differ significantly among different purchasers, regions or periods; and

     * (b) that those differences make the methods referred to in subsection (2) inappropriate for use in respect of a period constituting the whole or a part of the investigation period;

    * the Minister may, for that period, compare the respective export prices determined in relation to individual transactions during that period with the weighted average of corresponding normal values over that period.

    * (4) If, in a comparison under subsection (2), the Minister is satisfied that the weighted average of export prices over a period is less than the weighted average of corresponding normal values over that period:

     * (a) the goods exported to  during that period are taken to have been dumped; and

     * (b) the dumping margin for the exporter concerned in respect of those goods and that period is the difference between those weighted averages.

    * (4A) To avoid doubt, a reference to a period in subsection (4) includes a reference to a part of the investigation period.

    * (5) If, in a comparison under subsection (2), the Minister is satisfied that an export price in respect of an individual transaction during the investigation period is less than the corresponding normal value:

     * (a) the goods exported to  in that transaction are taken to have been dumped; and

     * (b) the dumping margin for the exporter concerned in respect of those goods and that transaction is the difference between that export price and that normal value.

    * (6) If, in a comparison under subsection (3), the Minister is satisfied that the export prices in respect of particular transactions during the investigation period are less than the weighted average of corresponding normal values during that period:

     * (a) the goods exported to  in each such transaction are taken to have been dumped; and

     * (b) the dumping margin for the exporter concerned in respect of those goods is the difference between each relevant export price and the weighted average of corresponding normal values.

    * (10) Any comparison of export prices, or weighted average of export prices, with any corresponding normal values, or weighted average of corresponding normal values, must be worked out in respect of similar units of goods, whether determined by weight, volume or otherwise.

##### 269TACC  Working out whether a financial contribution or income or price support confers a benefit

    * (1) Subject to subsections (2) and (3), the question whether a financial contribution or income or price support confers a benefit is to be determined by the Minister having regard to all relevant information.

    * (2) A direct financial payment received from any of the following is taken to confer a benefit:

     * (a) a government of a country;

     * (b) a public body of a country;

     * (c) a public body of which a government of a country is a member;

     * (d) a private body entrusted or directed by a government of a country or by such a public body to carry out a governmental function.

    * Guidelines for financial contributions

    * (3) In determining whether a financial contribution confers a benefit, the Minister must have regard to the following guidelines:

     * (a) the provision of equity capital from a government or body referred to in subsection (2) does not confer a benefit unless the decision to provide the capital is inconsistent with normal investment practice of private investors in the country concerned;

     * (b) the making of a loan by a government or body referred to in subsection (2) does not confer a benefit unless the loan requires the enterprise receiving the loan to repay a lesser amount than would be required for a comparable commercial loan which the enterprise could actually obtain;

     * (c) the guarantee of a loan by a government or body referred to in subsection (2) does not confer a benefit unless the enterprise receiving the guarantee is required to repay on the loan a lesser amount than would be required for a comparable commercial loan without that guarantee;

     * (d) the provision of goods or services by a government or body referred to in subsection (2) does not confer a benefit unless the goods or services are provided for less than adequate remuneration;

     * (e) the purchase of goods or services by a government or body referred to in subsection (2) does not confer a benefit unless the purchase is made for more than adequate remuneration.

    * (4) For the purposes of paragraphs (3)(d) and (e), the adequacy of remuneration in relation to goods or services is to be determined having regard to prevailing market conditions for like goods or services in the country where those goods or services are provided or purchased.

##### 269TACD  Amount of countervailable subsidy

    * (1) If the Minister is satisfied that a countervailable subsidy has been received in respect of goods, the amount of the subsidy is an amount determined by the Minister in writing.

    * (2) After the amount of the countervailable subsidy received in respect of goods has been worked out, the Minister must, if that subsidy is not quantified by reference to a unit of those goods determined by weight, volume or otherwise, work out how much of that amount is properly attributable to each such unit.

##### 269TAE  Material injury to industry

    * (1) In determining, for the purposes of section 269TG or 269TJ, whether material injury to an Australian industry has been or is being caused or is threatened or would or might have been caused, or whether the establishment of an Australian industry has been materially hindered, because of any circumstances in relation to the exportation of goods to Australia from the country of export, the Minister may, without limiting the generality of that section but subject to subsections (2A) to (2C), have regard to:

     * (aa) if the determination is being made for the purposes of section 269TG--the size of the dumping margin, or of each of the dumping margins, worked out in respect of goods of that kind that have been exported to Australia and dumped; and

     * (b) any increase or likely increase, during a particular period, in the quantity of goods of that kind exported to  from the country of export; and

     * (c) any change or likely change, during a particular period, in the proportion that:

      * (i) the quantity of goods of that kind exported to  from the country of export and sold or consumed in ; or

      * (ii) the quantity of goods of that kind, or like goods, produced or manufactured in the Australian industry and sold or consumed in ;

     * bears to the quantity of goods of that kind, or like goods, sold or consumed in ; and

     * (d) the export price that has been or is likely to be paid by importers for goods of that kind exported to  from the country of export; and

     * (e) the difference between:

      * (i) the price that has been or is likely to be paid for goods of that kind, or like goods, produced or manufactured in the Australian industry and sold in Australia; and

      * (ii) the price that has been or is likely to be paid for goods of that kind exported to Australia from the country of export and sold in Australia; and

     * (f) the effect that the exportation of goods of that kind to Australia from the country of export in those circumstances has had or is likely to have on the price paid for goods of that kind, or like goods, produced or manufactured in the Australian industry and sold in Australia; and

     * (g) any effect that the exportation of goods of that kind to Australia from the country of export in those circumstances has had or is likely to have on the relevant economic factors in relation to the Australian industry; and

     * (h) if the determination is being made for the purposes of section 269TJ and the goods are agricultural products--whether the exportation of goods of that kind to Australia from the country of export in those circumstances has given or is likely to give rise to a need for financial or other support, or an increase in financial or other support, for the Australian industry from the Commonwealth Government.

    * (2) In determining, for the purposes of section 269TH or 269TK, whether material injury to an industry in a third country has been or is being caused or is threatened or would or might have been caused because of any circumstances in relation to the exportation of goods to Australia from the country of export, the Minister may, without limiting the generality of that section but subject to subsections (2A) to (2C), have regard to:

     * (aa) if the determination is being made for the purposes of section 269TH--the size of the dumping margin, or of each of the dumping margins, worked out in respect of goods of that kind that have been exported to Australia and dumped; and

     * (ab) if the determination is being made for the purposes of section 269TK--particulars of any countervailable subsidy received in respect of goods of that kind that have been exported to Australia; and

     * (a) the quantity of goods of that kind that, during a particular period, have been or are likely to be exported to  from the country of export; and

     * (b) any increase or likely increase, during a particular period, in the quantity of goods of that kind exported to  from the country of export; and

     * (c) any change or likely change, during a particular period, in the proportion that:

      * (i) the quantity of goods of that kind exported to  from the country of export and sold or consumed in ; or

      * (ii) the quantity of goods of that kind, or like goods, produced or manufactured in the third country and sold or consumed in ;

     * bears to the quantity of goods of that kind, or like goods, sold or consumed in ; and

     * (d) the export price that has been or is likely to be paid by importers for goods of that kind exported to  from the country of export; and

      * (i) the price that has been or is likely to be paid for goods of that kind, or like goods, produced or manufactured in the third country and sold in Australia; and

      * (ii) the price that has been or is likely to be paid for goods of that kind exported to Australia from the country of export and sold in Australia; and

     * (g) any effect that the exportation of goods of that kind to Australia from the country of export in those circumstances has had or is likely to have on the relevant economic factors in relation to the producer or manufacturer in the third country.

    * (2A) In making a determination in relation to the exportation of goods to Australia for the purposes referred to in subsection (1) or (2), the Minister must consider whether any injury to an industry, or hindrance to the establishment of an industry, is being caused or threatened by a factor other than the exportation of those goods such as:

     * (a) the volume and prices of imported like goods that are not dumped; or

     * (b) the volume and prices of importations of like goods that are not subsidised; or

     * (c) contractions in demand or changes in patterns of consumption; or

     * (d) restrictive trade practices of, and competition between, foreign and Australian producers of like goods; or

     * (e) developments in technology; or

     * (f) the export performance and productivity of the Australian industry;

    * and any such injury or hindrance must not be attributed to the exportation of those goods.

    * (2AA) A determination for the purposes of subsection (1) or (2) must be based on facts and not merely on allegations, conjecture or remote possibilities.

    * (2B) In determining:

     * (a) for the purposes of subsection (1), whether or not material injury is threatened to an Australian industry; or

     * (b) for the purposes of subsection (2), whether or not material injury is threatened to an industry in a third country;

    * because of the exportation of goods into the Australian market, the Minister must take account only of such changes in circumstances, including changes of a kind determined by the Minister, as would make that injury foreseeable and imminent unless dumping or countervailing measures were imposed.

    * (2C) In determining, for the purposes referred to in subsection (1) or (2), the effect of the exportations of goods to Australia from different countries of export, the Minister should consider the cumulative effect of those exportations only if the Minister is satisfied that:

     * (a) each of those exportations is the subject of an investigation; and

     * (b) either:

      * (i) all the investigations of those exportations resulted from applications under section 269TB lodged with the Commissioner on the same day; or

      * (ii) the investigations of those exportations resulted from applications under section 269TB lodged with the Commissioner on different days but the investigation periods for all the investigations of those exportations overlap significantly; and

     * (c) if the determination is being made for the purposes of section 269TG or 269TH--the dumping margin worked out under section 269TACB for the exporter for each of the exportations is at least 2% of the export price or weighted average of export prices used to establish that dumping margin; and

     * (d) if the determination is being made for the purposes of section 269TG or 269TH--for each application, the volume of goods the subject of the application that have been, or may be, exported to  over a reasonable examination period (as defined in subsection 269TDA(17)) from the country of export and dumped is not taken to be negligible for the purposes of subsection 269TDA(3) because of subsection 269TDA(4); and

     * (da) if the determination is being made for the purposes of section 269TJ or 269TK:

      * (i) the amount of the countervailable subsidy in respect of the goods the subject of each of the exportations exceeds the negligible level of countervailable subsidy worked out under subsection 269TDA(16); and

      * (ii) the volume of each of those exportations is not negligible; and

     * (e) it is appropriate to consider the cumulative effect of those exportations, having regard to:

      * (i) the conditions of competition between those goods; and

      * (ii) the conditions of competition between those goods and like goods that are domestically produced.

    * (3) A reference in subsection (1) or (2) to the relevant economic factors in relation to an Australian industry, or in relation to an industry in a third country, in relation to goods of a particular kind exported to  is a reference to:

     * (f) the level of return on investment in the industry; and

     * (g) cash flow in the industry; and

     * (h) the number of persons employed, and the level of wages paid to persons employed, in the industry in relation to the production or manufacture of goods of that kind, or like goods; and

     * (ha) the terms and conditions of employment (including the number of hours worked) of persons employed in the industry in relation to the production or manufacture of goods of that kind, or like goods; and

##### 269TAF  Currency conversion 

    * (1) If, for the purposes of this Part, comparison of the export prices of goods exported to Australia and corresponding normal values of like goods requires a conversion of currencies, that conversion, subject to subsection (2), is to be made using the rate of exchange on the date of the transaction or agreement that, in the opinion of the Minister, best establishes the material terms of the sale of the exported goods.

    * (2) If, in relation to goods exported to , a forward rate of exchange is used, the Minister may, in a conversion of currencies under subsection (1), make use of that rate of exchange.

    * (3) If:

    * (5) Nothing in subsection (4) prevents the Minister specifying a day in a notice that is earlier than the day of publication of the notice if the day specified:

     * (a) is a day after the start of the sustained movement; and

     * (b) is not a day occurring within 60 days after the day specified in a prior notice.

    * (6) Nothing in subsection (4) prevents the Minister publishing more than one notice if a sustained movement in the rate of exchange continues for more than 60 days.

    * (7) The Commissioner may, if he or she considers it desirable so to do for the avoidance of doubt, specify, by notice published in the _Gazette_, a means of establishing a rate that is taken to be, or to have been, the rate of exchange between the Australian currency and another currency or between other currencies:

     * (a) on a day, or during a period, preceding the day of publication of the notice; or

     * (b) from and including the day of publication of the notice, or an earlier day specified in the notice, until the revocation of the notice.

    * (8) The rate of exchange established between currencies in a notice under subsection (7) is, for the purpose of working out the amount of duty or interim duty payable on any goods exported on the day or during the period to which the rate so specified applies, the rate of exchange that applies for the purposes of this section in respect of the currencies specified in the notice.

##### 269TAG  Minister may take antidumping measures on own initiative

    * (4) If the Commissioner makes a preliminary affirmative determination:

     * (a) the Commissioner must give public notice of that determination; and

     * (b) Customs may, at the time of making that determination or at any later time during the investigation, require and take securities under section 42 in respect of interim duty that may become payable if the Commissioner is satisfied that it is necessary to do so to prevent material injury to an Australian industry occurring while the investigation continues.

##### 269TDA  Termination of investigations 

    * Commissioner must terminate if all dumping margins are negligible

    * (1) If:

     * (a) application is made for a dumping duty notice; and

     * (b) in an investigation, for the purposes of the application, of an exporter to  of goods the subject of the application, the Commissioner is satisfied that:

      * (i) there has been no dumping by the exporter of any of those goods; or

      * (ii) there has been dumping by the exporter of some or all of those goods, but the dumping margin for the exporter, or each such dumping margin, worked out under section 269TACB, when expressed as a percentage of the export price or weighted average of export prices used to establish that dumping margin, is less than 2%;

    * the Commissioner must terminate the investigation so far as it relates to the exporter.

    * Commissioner must terminate if countervailable subsidisation is negligible

    * (2) If:

     * (a) application is made for a countervailing duty notice; and

    * the Commissioner must terminate the investigation so far as it relates to the exporter.

    * Commissioner must terminate if negligible volumes of dumping are found

    * (3) If:

     * (a) application is made for a dumping duty notice; and

     * (b) in an investigation for the purposes of the application the Commissioner is satisfied that the total volume of goods the subject of the application:

      * (i) that have been, or may be, exported to  over a reasonable examination period from a particular country of export; and

    * Negligible dumping margins to count in determining volume

    * (6) The fact that the dumping margin, or each of the dumping margins, in relation to a particular exporter, when expressed as a percentage of the export price or weighted average of export prices used to establish that dumping margin, is less than 2%, does not prevent exports by that exporter being taken into account:

     * (a) in working out the total volume of goods that have been, or may be, exported from a country of export and dumped; and

     * (b) in aggregating, for the purposes of subsection (5), the volumes of goods that have been, or may be, exported from that country of export and other countries of export and dumped.

     * (a) that country of export is not a developing country and that total volume, when expressed as a percentage of the total Australian import volume, is less than 3%; or

     * (b) that country of export is a developing country and that total volume, when expressed as a percentage of the total Australian import volume, is less than 4%;

    * and subsections (9), (10) and (11) do not apply in relation to those firstmentioned goods.

    * Aggregation of volumes of subsidised goods from countries other than developing countries

    * (9) For the purposes of subsection (8), this subsection applies in relation to goods the subject of the application that have been, or may be, exported to Australia over a reasonable examination period from the particular country of export and in respect of which a countervailable subsidy has been, or may be, received, if:

    * (12) The fact that the level of countervailable subsidy that has been, or may be, received in respect of goods that have been, exported, or may be exported, to Australia from a country of export is a negligible level under subsection (16) does not prevent exports from that country being taken into account:

     * (a) in working out the total volume of goods that have been, or may be, exported from a country of export and in respect of which a countervailable subsidy has been, or may be, payable; and

     * (b) in aggregating, for the purposes of subsection (9), (10) or (11), volumes of goods that have been, or may be, exported to Australia from that country and other countries and in respect of which a countervailing subsidy has been, or may be, received.

    * the Commissioner must terminate the investigation so far as it relates to that country.

    * Commissioner must give public notice of termination decisions

    * (15) If the Commissioner decides to terminate an investigation so far as it relates to a particular exporter or country of export, the Commissioner must:

    * (4) The Commissioner is not obliged to have regard to any submission made in response to the statement of essential facts that is received by the Commissioner after the end of the period referred to in subparagraph (3)(a)(iv) if to do so would, in the Commissioner's opinion, prevent the timely preparation of the report to the Minister.

    * (5) The report to the Minister must include a statement of the Commissioner's reasons for any recommendation contained in the report that:

     * (a) sets out the material findings of fact on which that recommendation is based; and

     * (a) if application has been made for publication of a dumping duty notice in respect of goods--is an exporter of such goods; or

     * (b) if application has been made for publication of a countervailing duty notice in respect of goods--is the government of the country of export, or is an exporter, of such goods;

    * may, at any time after the making of a preliminary affirmative determination in respect of the application, indicate in writing to the Commissioner the terms in which the government or exporter would be prepared to give an undertaking to the Minister.

    * (2) The Commissioner must consider whether he or she is satisfied that those terms are adequate to remove the injury, or the threat of injury, to which the application is addressed so far as the government or exporter offering the undertaking is concerned and, by notice in writing:

     * (a) if the Commissioner is so satisfied--recommend to the Minister that he or she accept the undertaking; or

     * (b) if the Commissioner is not so satisfied--indicate to the government or exporter the reasons why he or she is not so satisfied.

    * (3) A government or an exporter may, having regard to those reasons, indicate to the Commissioner that the government or exporter is prepared to give an undertaking to the Minister in revised terms.

    * (4) If an undertaking in revised terms is proposed to the Commissioner, the Commissioner must:

     * (a) if he or she is not satisfied that the undertaking as so revised is adequate to remove the injury, or the threat of injury, to which the application is addressed--inform the government or exporter to that effect; and

     * (b) if he or she is so satisfied--recommend to the Minister that the Minister accept the undertaking as revised.

    * (5) If the Minister accepts the undertaking proposed by a government, investigation of the application is suspended so far as it relates to goods exported from that country.

    * (6) If the Minister accepts the undertaking proposed by an exporter, investigation of the application is suspended so far as it relates to goods exported by that exporter.

     * (a) investigation of an application is suspended:

      * (i) so far as it relates to goods exported from a particular country; or

    * the Minister may take such steps as he or she considers necessary to facilitate the resumption of the investigation in so far as it relates to goods exported from that country or by that exporter.

    * (8) Without limiting the generality of subsection (7), the Minister may, in writing, require the Commissioner to resume the investigation so far as it relates to goods exported from the country, or by the exporter, who breached the undertaking subject to such conditions as to the conduct of the investigation as the Minister considers appropriate.

    * (9) In determining the steps to be taken in order to facilitate the resumption of an investigation, and, where the Minister requires that the Commissioner resume the investigation, to determine the conditions on which the resumed investigation is to be conducted, the Minister must have regard to:

     * (a) the procedures that had been completed when the undertaking was accepted; and

     * (b) the length of time that has elapsed since the acceptance of the undertaking.

    * (10) The Commissioner is not obliged to consider the terms of any proposed undertaking provided by a government or an exporter if to do so would prevent the timely making of a recommendation by the Commissioner to the Minister under section 269TEA.

    * (11) If the Commissioner does not recommend the acceptance of an undertaking under this section, the Commissioner may nonetheless recommend to the Minister that he or she seek an undertaking from the government or exporter who proposed the undertaking and set out the terms of the undertaking that he or she recommends the Minister seek.

#### Division 3--Consideration of antidumping matters by the Minister

##### 269TF  What this Division is about

    * This Division sets out the role of the Minister in considering an antidumping matter. The Minister will normally be acting after receipt of a report from the Commissioner. In particular, the Division:

     *  	empowers the Minister to publish dumping duty notices or countervailing duty notices;

     *  	empowers the Minister to accept undertakings rather than publish such notices;

     *  	outlines the matters of which the Minister must be satisfied before publishing such notices or accepting such undertakings;

     *  	indicates the period during which such notices or undertakings remain in force;

     *  	sets out the circumstances in which such notices can extend to goods already exported.

##### 269TG  Dumping duties

    * (1) Subject to section 269TN, where the Minister is satisfied, as to any goods that have been exported to , that:

     * (a) the amount of the export price of the goods is less than the amount of the normal value of those goods; and

     * (b) because of that:

      * (i) material injury to an Australian industry producing like goods has been or is being caused or is threatened, or the establishment of an Australian industry producing like goods has been or may be materially hindered; or

      * (ii) in a case where security has been taken under section 42 in respect of any interim duty that may become payable on the goods under section 8 of the Dumping Duty Act--material injury to an Australian industry producing like goods would or might have been caused if the security had not been taken;

    * the Minister may, by public notice, declare that section 8 of that Act applies: 

     * (c) to the goods in respect of which the Minister is so satisfied; and 

     * (d) to like goods that were exported to  after the Commissioner made a preliminary affirmative determination under section 269TD in respect of the goods referred to in paragraph (c) but before the publication of that notice.

    * (2) Where the Minister is satisfied, as to goods of any kind, that:

     * (a) the amount of the export price of like goods that have already been exported to Australia is less than the amount of the normal value of those goods, and the amount of the export price of like goods that may be exported to Australia in the future may be less than the normal value of the goods; and

     * (b) because of that, material injury to an Australian industry producing like goods has been or is being caused or is threatened, or the establishment of an Australian industry producing like goods has been or may be materially hindered;

    * the Minister may, by public notice (whether or not he or she has made, or proposes to make, a declaration under subsection (1) in respect of like goods that have been exported to Australia), declare that section 8 of the Dumping Duty Act applies to like goods that are exported to Australia after the date of publication of the notice or such later date as is specified in the notice.

    * (3) Where:

     * (a) a notice under subsection (1) declares particular goods to be goods to which section 8 of the Dumping Duty Act applies; or

     * (b) a notice under subsection (2) declares like goods in relation to goods of a particular kind to be goods to which that section applies;

    * the notice must, subject to subsection (3A), include a statement of the respective amounts that the Minister ascertained, at the time of publication of the notice:

     * (c) was or would be the normal value of the goods to which the declaration relates; and

     * (d) was or would be the export price of those goods; and

     * (e) was or would be the noninjurious price of those goods.

    * (3A) If any person who has provided information to assist the Minister to ascertain the normal value, export price or noninjurious price of goods to which a declaration under subsection (1) or (2) relates claims, in writing, that the information is confidential or that the inclusion in a notice under that subsection of that value or price would adversely affect the person's business or commercial interests:

     * (a) in accordance with subsection 269ZI(9) the Minister is not required to include in the notice a statement of that value or price; but

     * (b) upon request the Commissioner may notify that value or price to persons who, in the Commissioner's opinion, would be affected parties in any review of the rate of interim duty imposed on like goods to the goods to which the declaration relates.

    * (3D) If the export of a consignment of goods to Australia by an exporter has been under consideration by the Minister so as to decide whether or not to publish a dumping duty notice under this section in relation to the goods in the consignment or to like goods, the Minister may give notice, in writing, to the exporter stating that:

     * (a) the Minister is of the opinion that it would be appropriate for the exporter to give an undertaking in accordance with subsection (4) to the Minister; and

     * (b) an undertaking, in the terms set out in the notice, would be satisfactory to the Minister.

    * (4) Whether or not a notice has been given to an exporter, the Minister may defer the decision to publish or not to publish a dumping duty notice covering that exporter, for so long as the Minister considers appropriate, if the exporter offers, and the Minister accepts, an undertaking that the exporter will so conduct future trade to Australia in like goods as to avoid:

     * (a) causing or threatening material injury to an Australian industry producing like goods; or

     * (b) materially hindering the establishment of such an Australian industry.

    * (5) In giving a notice, and in considering the terms of any proposed undertaking, the Minister must have regard to the desirability that any price increase to which the undertaking relates is limited to an amount such that the total price of the goods is not more than the noninjurious price of the goods.

    * (5A) However, subsection (5) does not require the Minister to have regard to the matter in that subsection if the Minister is satisfied that either or both of the following apply in relation to the goods in the consignment:

     * (a) the normal value of the goods was not ascertained under subsection 269TAC(1) because of the operation of subparagraph 269TAC(2)(a)(ii);

     * (b) there is an Australian industry in respect of like goods that consists of at least 2 smallmedium enterprises, whether or not that industry consists of other enterprises.

    * (6) The Minister:

     * (a) may give a notice to an exporter under subsection (3D) whether or not the giving of such a notice has been recommended by the Commissioner in a report under section 269TEA; and

     * (b) may accept an undertaking whether or not the acceptance of such an undertaking has been recommended by the Commissioner in a recommendation under section 269TEB; and

     * (c) must not give a notice to an exporter under subsection (3D), or accept an undertaking from an exporter, before a preliminary affirmative determination, or an equivalent determination in an investigation conducted under section 269TAG, has been made that extends to that exporter; and

     * (d) must give public notice of any undertaking so accepted.

    * (7) The acceptance by the Minister of an undertaking may be subject to conditions that include, but are not limited to, conditions relating to:

     * (a) giving the Minister, on an agreed basis, information that is relevant to the fulfilment of the undertaking; and

     * (b) providing the Minister with appropriate access to such information.

    * (8) The acceptance by the Minister of an undertaking from an exporter does not prevent the exporter requesting the Minister to determine whether, had the undertaking not been accepted, the Minister would have published a dumping duty notice or would have decided not to publish such a notice.

    * (9) The Minister must, if an exporter makes such a request, and may, on his or her own initiative, determine whether he or she would have published a dumping duty notice or would have decided not to publish such a notice if the undertaking had not been accepted.

    * (10) Subsection (9) does not imply that the Minister is required to make a determination under that subsection before the Minister has received a report of the Commissioner in relation to the matter.

    * (11) If the Minister determines under subsection (9) that he or she would have decided not to publish a dumping duty notice, the undertaking automatically lapses.

##### 269TH  Third country dumping duties

    * (1) Subject to section 269TN, where the Minister is satisfied, as to any goods produced or manufactured in a particular country that have been exported to , that:

     * (e) was or would be the noninjurious price of those goods.

     * (a) in accordance with subsection 269ZI(9), the Minister is not required to include in the notice a statement of that value or price; but

     * (b) the Minister considers that material injury, which is difficult to repair, has been caused to an Australian industry by the export to  during a short period of large quantities of goods of the same kind because a countervailable subsidy has been received from the country of export or country of origin of those goods, and the Minister considers that the publication of the notice is necessary to prevent the recurrence of the injury.

    * (6) Before the Minister decides to publish a countervailing duty notice under subsection 269TJ(1) in circumstances referred to in subsection (5) of this section, in respect of goods that have already been entered for home consumption, the Minister must:

In particular, the Division provides that:

     *  	if the duty is less than the interim duty, the excess is to be refunded;

     *  	if the duty is more than the interim duty, the interim duty is treated as duty and the balance waived;

     *  	if the importer fails, within the time limits available, to seek an assessment of duty, the interim duty paid on the goods is taken to be duty actually payable.

##### 269V  Importers may apply for duty assessment in certain circumstances 

    * (1) An importer of goods on which, under the Dumping Duty Act, an interim duty has been paid may, subject to subsection (2), by application lodged with the Commissioner, request that the Minister make an assessment of the liability of those goods to duty under that Act.

    * (1) An application for an assessment of duty on goods of a particular kind entered for home consumption during a particular importation period must be in writing and contain:

        * Note: The Commissioner may be required to reject the application or be able to terminate the examination of it without deciding what recommendation to make to the Minister. See section 269YA.

    * (2) If the Commissioner considers that any person (including the applicant) may be able to supply information relevant to the consideration of the application, the Commissioner may, by notice in writing, request the supply of that information, in writing:

     * (a) if the information is sought from a person other than the applicant--within a period specified in the notice ending not later than 120 days after the lodgment of the application; and

     * (b) if the information is sought from the applicant--within a period specified in the notice ending not later than 155 days after the lodgment of the application.

    * (3) Where the Commissioner proposes to take into account any relevant information that was not supplied to the Commissioner by the applicant, the Commissioner must:

     * (a) give the applicant a copy of the information that he or she proposes to take into account unless, in the opinion of the Commissioner, the provision of that information would adversely affect the business or commercial interests of a person supplying the information; and

     * (b) invite the applicant, within a specified period ending not later than 155 days after the lodgment of the application, to make any further submission the applicant considers appropriate in relation to that information.

    * (3A) However, the Commissioner must not give the applicant information that the exporter of goods covered by the application supplied to the Commissioner (whether as a result of a request under subsection (2) or otherwise) that is relevant to working out:

     * (a) the normal value of the goods; or

     * (b) the countervailable subsidy relating to the goods; or

     * (c) the export price of the goods;

    * unless the exporter indicates that he or she is willing for the Commissioner to give the information to the applicant under paragraph (3)(a).

    * (4) If a person refuses or fails to supply information or to make a submission within the period allowed but subsequently supplies that information or makes that submission, the Commissioner may disregard that information or submission in considering the application.

    * (5) On the basis of the information and evidence contained in the application, any other information provided under subsection (2) or (3) that is not disregarded under subsection (4) and any other information the Commissioner considers relevant, the Commissioner must:

     * (a) provisionally ascertain, in relation to each consignment of goods to which the application relates, each variable factor relevant to the determination of duty payable on the goods under the Dumping Duty Act; and

     * (b) having regard to those variable factors as so provisionally ascertained and, where appropriate, to the noninjurious price of goods of that kind--provisionally calculate, in respect of each such consignment, the amount of duty payable under the Dumping Duty Act.

     * (b) the prescribed deductions (as defined in subsection 269TAB(2)) relating to the goods.

    * (5B) In provisionally ascertaining the export price of goods as described in subsection (5A), the Commissioner must:

     * (a) take account of the following in relation to the goods:

      * (i) any change in normal value;

      * (i) that the Minister make an assessment of duty by ascertaining, for each consignment of those goods, the variable factors as so provisionally ascertained; and

      * (ii) that the Minister order a repayment of the amount of interim duty overpaid; or

     * (c) if satisfied that the total amount of duty payable under the Dumping Duty Act on the goods the subject of the application is equal to or exceeds the total of interim duty that was paid on the goods--to recommend to the Minister:

      * (i) that the Minister make an assessment of duty by ascertaining, for each consignment of those goods, the variable factors as so provisionally ascertained; but

      * (ii) that the Minister order that any duty in excess of the interim duty paid on those goods be waived.

##### 269ZA  Applications and requests for review of antidumping measures

    * (1) If:

     * (a) antidumping measures have been taken in respect of goods; and

     * (b) an affected party considers that it may be appropriate to review those measures as they affect a particular exporter of those goods, or as they affect exporters of those goods generally, because:

      * (i) one or more of the variable factors relevant to the taking of the measures in relation to that exporter or those exporters have changed; or

      * (ii) the antidumping measures are no longer warranted;

    * the affected party may, by application lodged with the Commissioner, request that the Commissioner initiate such a review.

    * (2) An application for review of antidumping measures must not be made:

     * (a) if the measures involve the publication of a dumping duty notice or a countervailing duty notice--earlier than 12 months after:

      * (i) the publication of the notice; or

      * (ii) the publication of a notice declaring the outcome of the last review of the notice (whether that last review was undertaken at the applicant's request or not); and

     * (b) if the measures involve the acceptance of an undertaking--earlier than 12 months after:

      * (i) the publication of notice of the acceptance of that undertaking; or

      * (ii) the publication of a notice declaring the outcome of the last review of the undertaking (whether that last review was undertaken at the applicant's request or not).

        * Example: If an application under section 269TB resulted in:

         * (a) the publication of the acceptance of an undertaking from exporter A on 1 January 1999; and

         * (b) the publication of a dumping duty notice covering exporters B and C on 1 March 1999;

        * an affected party could seek review of the undertaking on 2 January 2000 but could not seek review of both the undertaking and the dumping duty notices until 2 March 2000.

        * However, the Minister could decide to review the notices before 2 March 2000 either on his or her own initiative or on the recommendation of the Commissioner. See subsection (3).

    * (3) If:

     * (a) antidumping measures have been taken in respect of goods; and

     * (b) the Minister considers (either as a result of a recommendation from the Commissioner under subsection 269ZC(4) or on his or her own initiative) that it may be appropriate to review those measures as they affect a particular exporter of those goods, or as they affect exporters of those goods generally, because:

      * (i) one or more of the variable factors relevant to the taking of the measures in relation to that exporter or those exporters may have changed; or

      * (ii) the antidumping measures are no longer warranted;

    * the Minister may, at any time, by notice in writing, request that the Commissioner initiate a review under this Division.

    * (4) If, as a result of a person's application under Division 6 for accelerated review of a dumping duty notice or a countervailing duty notice, the Minister has made a declaration under subsection 269ZG(3):

     * (a) that person may not make an application, under subsection (1) of this section, for a review of that notice earlier than 12 months after the making of that declaration; but

     * (b) for the purpose of determining whether subsection (2) permits any other person to apply for a review of the notice, the making of that declaration is not to be treated as a review of the notice.

    * (5) If:

     * (a) a person applies, under Division 9, for a review of the Minister's decision to publish a dumping duty notice or a countervailing duty notice or not to publish such a notice; and 

     * (b) as a result of that review:

      * (i) a dumping duty notice or a countervailing duty notice is published by the Minister despite an earlier decision not to publish such a notice; or

      * (ii) a dumping duty notice or countervailing duty notice originally published by the Minister is varied; or

      * (iii) another dumping duty notice or countervailing duty notice is substituted for the notice originally published by the Minister;

    * then, for the purpose only of determining whether subsection (2) permits a review of the new notice, the notice as varied or the substituted notice, that new notice, notice as varied or substituted notice has effect as if it had been published at the time of the Minister's decision not to publish a notice, or at the time of publication of the original notice, as the case requires.
