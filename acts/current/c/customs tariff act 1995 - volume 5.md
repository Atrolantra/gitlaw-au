### Section XV--Base metals and articles of base metal

#### Chapter 74--Copper and articles thereof

##### Note.  

    * 1.	In this Chapter the following have the meanings hereby assigned to them:

     * (a) **Refined copper**

     * **		Metal containing at least 99.85% by weight of copper; or

     * Metal containing at least 97.5% by weight of copper, provided that the content by weight of any other element does not exceed the limit specified in the following table:

       * (1) Other elements are, for example, Al, Be, Co, Fe, Mn, Ni, Si.

     * (b) **Copper alloys**

     * **		Metallic substances other than unrefined copper in which copper predominates by weight over each of the other elements, provided that:

       * (i) the content by weight of at least one of the other elements is greater than the limit specified in the foregoing table; or

       * (ii) the total content by weight of such other elements exceeds 2.5%.

     * (c) **Master alloys**

     * **		Alloys containing with other elements more than 10% by weight of copper, not usefully malleable and commonly used as an additive in the manufacture of other alloys or as deoxidants, desulphurising agents or for similar uses in the metallurgy of nonferrous metals. However, copper phosphide (phosphor copper) containing more than 15% by weight of phosphorus falls in 2848.00.00.

     * (d) **Bars and rods**

     * **		Rolled, extruded, drawn or forged products, not in coils, which have a uniform solid crosssection along their whole length in the shape of circles, ovals, rectangles (including squares), equilateral triangles or regular convex polygons (including "flattened circles" and "modified rectangles", of which two opposite sides are convex arcs, the other two sides being straight, of equal length and parallel). Products, with a rectangular (including square), triangular or polygonal crosssection may have corners rounded along their whole length. The thickness of such products which have a rectangular (including "modified rectangular") crosssection exceeds onetenth of the width. "Bars and rods" also covers cast or sintered products, of the same forms and dimensions, which have been subsequently worked after production (otherwise than by simple trimming or descaling), provided that they have not thereby assumed the character of articles or products of other headings.

     * Wirebars and billets with their ends tapered or otherwise worked simply to facilitate their entry into machines for converting them into, for example, drawing stock (wirerod) or tubes, are however to be taken to be unwrought copper of 7403.

     * (e) **Profiles**

     * **		Rolled, extruded, drawn, forged or formed products, coiled or not, of a uniform crosssection along their whole length, which do not conform to any of the definitions of bars, rods, wire, plates, sheets, strip, foil, tubes or pipes. "Profiles" also covers cast or sintered products, of the same forms, which have been subsequently worked after production (otherwise than by simple trimming or descaling), provided that they have not thereby assumed the character of articles or products of other headings.

     * (f) **Wire**

     * **		Rolled, extruded or drawn products, in coils, which have a uniform solid crosssection along their whole length in the shape of circles, ovals, rectangles (including squares), equilateral triangles or regular convex polygons (including "flattened circles" and "modified rectangles", of which two opposite sides are convex arcs, the other two sides being straight, of equal length and parallel). Products with a rectangular (including square), triangular or polygonal crosssection may have corners rounded along their whole length. The thickness of such products which have a rectangular (including "modified rectangular") crosssection exceeds onetenth of the width.

     * (g) **Plates, sheets, strip and foil**

     * **		Flatsurfaced products (other than the unwrought products of 7403), coiled or not, of solid rectangular (other than square) crosssection with or without rounded corners (including "modified rectangles" of which two opposite sides are convex arcs, the other two sides being straight, of equal length and parallel) of a uniform thickness, which are:

      * of rectangular (including square) shape with a thickness not exceeding onetenth of the width,

      * of a shape other than rectangular or square, of any size, provided that they do not assume the character of articles or products of other headings.

     * 7409 and 7410 apply, _inter alia_, to plates, sheets, strip and foil with patterns (for example, grooves, ribs, chequers, tears, buttons, lozenges) and to such products which have been perforated, corrugated, polished or coated, provided that they do not thereby assume the character of articles or products of other headings.

     * (h) **Tubes and pipes**

     * **		Hollow products, coiled or not, which have a uniform crosssection with only one enclosed void along their whole length in the shape of circles, ovals, rectangles (including squares), equilateral triangles or regular convex polygons, and which have a uniform wall thickness. Products with a rectangular (including square), equilateral triangular or regular convex polygonal crosssection, which may have corners rounded along their whole length, are also to be taken to be tubes and pipes provided the inner and outer crosssections are concentric and have the same form and orientation. Tubes and pipes of the foregoing crosssections may be polished, coated, bent, threaded, drilled, waisted, expanded, coneshaped or fitted with flanges, collars or rings.

##### Subheading Note.  

    * 1.	In this Chapter the following have the meanings hereby assigned to them:

     * (a) **Copperzinc base alloys (brasses)**

     * **		Alloys of copper and zinc, with or without other elements. When other elements are present:

      * zinc predominates by weight over each of such other elements;

      * any nickel content by weight is less than 5% (see coppernickelzinc alloys (nickel silvers)); and

      * any tin content by weight is less than 3% (see coppertin alloys (bronzes)).

     * (b) **Coppertin base alloys (bronzes)**

     * **		Alloys of copper and tin, with or without other elements. When other elements are present, tin predominates by weight over each of such other elements, except that when the tin content is 3% or more the zinc content by weight may exceed that of tin but must be less than 10%.

     * (c) **Coppernickelzinc base alloys (nickel silvers)**

     * **		Alloys of copper, nickel and zinc, with or without other elements. The nickel content is 5% or more by weight (see copperzinc alloys (brasses)).

     * (d) **Coppernickel base alloys**
