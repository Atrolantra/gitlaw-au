     * (a) having regard to the manner in which they are put up, clearly identifiable as being intended to be used together without first being repacked;

     * (b) presented together; and

     * (c) identifiable, whether by their nature or by the relative proportions in which they are present, as being complementary one to another.

    * 2.	Except for the goods of 3918 or 3919, plastics, rubber, and articles thereof, printed with motifs, characters or pictorial representations, which are not merely incidental to the primary use of the goods, fall in Chapter 49.

"Tubes, pipes and hoses" also includes sausage casings and other layflat tubing. However, except for the lastmentioned, those having an internal crosssection other than round, oval, rectangular (in which the length does not exceed 1.5 times the width) or in the shape of a regular polygon are not to be regarded as tubes, pipes and hoses but as profile shapes.

    * 9.	For the purposes of 3918, "wall or ceiling coverings of plastics" applies to products in rolls, of a width not less than 45 cm, suitable for wall or ceiling decoration, consisting of plastics fixed permanently on a backing of any material other than paper, the layer of plastics (on the face side) being grained, embossed, coloured, designprinted or otherwise decorated.

    * 10.	In 3920 and 3921, "plates, sheets, film, foil and strip" applies only to plates, sheets, film, foil and strip (other than those of Chapter 54) and to blocks of regular geometric shape, whether or not printed or otherwise surfaceworked, uncut or cut into rectangles (including squares) but not further worked (even if when so cut they become articles ready for use).

    * 11.	3925 applies only to the following articles, not being products covered by any of the earlier headings of subChapter II:

     * (ij) Fittings and mountings intended for permanent installation in or on doors, windows, staircases, walls or other parts of buildings, for example, knobs, handles, hooks, brackets, towel rails, switchplates and other protective plates.

##### Subheading Notes.  

    * 1.	Within any one heading of this Chapter, polymers (including copolymers) and chemically modified polymers are to be classified according to the following provisions:

     * (a) Where there is a subheading named "Other" in the same series:

      * (1) The designation in a subheading of a polymer by the prefix "poly" (for example, polyethylene and polyamide6,6) means that the constituent monomer unit or monomer units of the named polymer taken together must contribute 95% or more by weight of the total polymer content.

      * (2) The copolymers named in 3901.30.00, 3903.20.00, 3903.30.00 and 3904.30.00 are to be classified in those subheadings, provided that the comonomer units of the named copolymers contribute 95% or more by weight of the total polymer content.

      * (3) Chemically modified polymers are to be classified in the subheading named "Other", provided that the chemically modified polymers are not more specifically covered by another subheading.

      * (4) Polymers not meeting (1), (2) or (3) above, are to be classified in the subheading, among the remaining subheadings in the series, covering polymers of that monomer unit which predominates by weight over every other single comonomer unit. For this purpose, constituent monomer units of polymers falling in the same subheading shall be taken together. Only the constituent comonomer units of the polymers in the series of subheadings under consideration are to be compared.

     * (b) Where there is no subheading named "Other" in the same series:

      * (1) Polymers are to be classified in the subheading covering polymers of that monomer unit which predominates by weight over every other single comonomer unit. For this purpose, constituent monomer units of polymers falling in the same subheading shall be taken together. Only the constituent comonomer units of the polymers in the series under consideration are to be compared.

      * (2) Chemically modified polymers are to be classified in the subheading appropriate to the unmodified polymer.

    * Polymer blends are to be classified in the same subheading as polymers of the same monomer units in the same proportions.

    * 2.	For the purposes of 3920.43.00, "plasticisers" includes secondary plasticisers.
