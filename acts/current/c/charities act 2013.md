### An Act to define charity and charitable purpose, and for related purposes

##### [Assented to 29 June 2013]

#### Preamble

    * The Parliament of Australia recognises the unique nature and diversity of charities and the distinctive and important role that they play in Australia.

    * Until now, the meaning of charity in Commonwealth law has largely been that of the common law, based on the preamble to the Statute of Charitable Uses 1601.

    * Modern, comprehensive, statutory definitions of charity and charitable purpose, applying for the purposes of all Commonwealth law and ensuring continuity by utilising familiar concepts from the common law, will provide clarity and certainty as to the meaning of those concepts in contemporary Australia.
