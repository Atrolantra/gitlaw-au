     * (d) include in the superannuation order an order that the amount so specified be paid to the Commonwealth or Commonwealth authority, whichever the court considers appropriate.

    * (4) Where any benefits have been paid to the person under any superannuation scheme (whether before, on or after the commencing day), the court must:

     * (a) specify in the superannuation order the amount worked out using the formula:

    * where: 

     * **_AB _**_(_**_amount of benefits_**_)_ is the amount that the court thinks reflects the value of the sum of the benefits paid by the Commonwealth or Commonwealth authority to the person under the scheme for any period of employment (not just a period during which the offence was committed) as at the day on which the order is made. 

     * **_EC _**_(_**_employee contributions_**_)_ is the amount that the court thinks is equal to the part of **AB** that is attributable to the sum of the employee contributions paid under the scheme by the person as at that day plus the interest on those contributions accrued under the scheme before that day; and

     * (b) include in the superannuation order an order that the person pay the amount so specified to the Commonwealth or Commonwealth authority, whichever the court considers appropriate.

    * (5) For the purposes of subsection (4), the value of an amount of employer contributions or benefits, and of accrued interest, is their value worked out having regard to any decline in the purchasing power of money between the day on which the contributions or benefits were made or paid, or the interest accrued, as the case may be, and the day as at which their value must be worked out.

    * (6) The DPP must give written notice of a superannuation order to the person's superannuation authority.

##### 20  When does a superannuation order take effect?

    * (1) A superannuation order made in relation to a person who has absconded takes effect on the day on which it is made.

    * (2) A superannuation order made in relation to a person, other than a person who has absconded, does not take effect until:

     * (a) the end of the period (if any) allowed for appealing against the conviction or sentence under the relevant Commonwealth, State or Territory law; or

     * (b) if the person appeals against his or her conviction or sentence, or both--the appeal, and any proceedings resulting from it, are finally determined, withdrawn or otherwise disposed of.

##### 21  Effect of superannuation orders

    * (1) Where a court makes a superannuation order in respect of a person:

     * (a) all rights of, and benefits payable to or in respect of, the person or a dependant of the person (being rights or benefits arising out of the person's membership of any superannuation scheme) cease, or cease to be payable, on the day on which the order takes effect, and the person ceases to be a member of the scheme on that day; and

     * (b) any amount of the kind mentioned in subsection 19(3) that is vested in the person ceases to be so vested on that day; and

     * (c) the Commonwealth or a Commonwealth authority is not liable to pay any employer contribution or benefit under the scheme in respect of the person on or after that day.

    * (2) An amount payable by a person to the Commonwealth or a Commonwealth authority under a superannuation order is a debt due by the person to the Commonwealth or the Commonwealth authority, as the case may be.

    * (3) An order under subsection 19(3) or (4) against a person may be enforced as if it were an order made in civil proceedings instituted by the Commonwealth or the relevant Commonwealth authority against the person to recover a debt due by the person to the Commonwealth or the Commonwealth authority, and the debt arising from the order is to be taken to be a judgment debt.

    * (4) Despite the Superannuation Act, or any other Act or any agreement, where subsection (1) applies to a person who is an employee when the superannuation order takes effect, the person is entitled, on the day on which he or she ceases to be a member of the relevant superannuation scheme, to payment of an amount equal to the sum of the employee contributions paid under the scheme by the person (being contributions that are held in a fund under the scheme) plus the amount of interest on those contributions accrued under the scheme.

    * (5) Despite the Superannuation Act, or any other Act or any agreement, where subsection (1) applies to a person who:

     * (a) was an employee when the relevant corruption offence was committed but ceases to be an employee before the superannuation order takes effect; and

     * (b) would, but for that subsection, have been entitled to payment of benefits under the relevant superannuation scheme on or after the day on which the superannuation order takes effect;

    * the person is entitled, on the day on which he or she ceases to be a member of the scheme, to payment of an amount worked out using the formula:

    * where: 

    * **_AC_**_ (_**_amount of contributions_**_)_ is an amount equal to the sum of the employee contributions paid under the scheme by the person plus the amount of interest on those contributions accrued under the scheme.

    * **_AR_**_ (_**_amount received_**_)_ is an amount equal to that part of the sum of all amounts paid by way of benefit before the day on which the superannuation order takes effect that is attributable to **AC**.

##### 22  Superannuation orders: variation

    * (1) If a superannuation order made in respect of a person:

     * (a) specifies an amount under subsection 19(3) or (4); and

     * (b) takes effect on a day that is later than the day on which the order is made;

    * the DPP may, as soon as practicable after the order takes effect, apply to the court that made the order to vary the order by substituting for the specified amount an increased amount, having regard to any amount of employer contributions or benefits paid by the Commonwealth or a Commonwealth authority in respect of the person during the prescribed period.

    * (2) Where the DPP makes an application, the court must vary the superannuation order accordingly and, for the purposes of working out the increased amount to be specified in the superannuation order, as varied, subsections 19(3), (4) and (5) apply as if references in subsections 19(3) and (4) to the day on which the order is made were references to the day on which the variation is made.

    * (3) In this section:

    * **_prescribed period_** means the period starting on the day on which the superannuation order is made and ending on the day on which the variation is made.

##### 23  Superannuation orders: revocation

    * (1) A superannuation order made in relation to a person is to be taken to have been revoked if:

     * (a) the person's conviction is quashed; or

     * (b) the person's sentence is so reduced or otherwise changed that it would no longer support the making of an application for a superannuation order under subsection 17(1A); or

     * (c) where the person is taken to be convicted because of paragraph 6(1)(b)--the person is brought before a court in respect of the offence concerned and, having been convicted of that offence, does not receive a sentence that would support the making of an application for a superannuation order under subsection 17(1A).

    * (2) Where a superannuation order is taken to have been revoked, the DPP must give written notice of the fact to:

     * (a) the person in respect of whom the order was made; and

     * (b) the person's superannuation authority.

    * (3) Where:

     * (a) a superannuation order is made in relation to a person who is taken to be convicted because of paragraph 6(1)(b); and

     * (b) the superannuation order is to be taken to have been revoked;

    * there is payable to the person an amount determined by the Finance Minister, being an amount that the Minister considers to be a fair recompense to the person, having regard to:

     * (c) any amount paid to the person under subsection 21(4) or (5); and

     * (d) any amount recovered from the person under a recovery order against the person; and

     * (e) any other financial loss sustained by the person as a result of the superannuation order; and

     * (f) any other matters that the Minister thinks are relevant in the circumstances of the case.

    * (1) Where a person (in this Part called **_the defendant_**):

     * (a) has been convicted of an offence; or

    * the DPP may apply to the appropriate court for a restraining order against specified property of the defendant or of another person, or both.

    * (2) For the purposes of an application, the DPP may, on behalf of the Commonwealth, give the court such undertakings with respect to the payment of damages or costs, or both, as the court requires.

     * (a) the offence concerned is, or may be, a corruption offence; and

     * (b) if the defendant has been sentenced in respect of the offence--the sentence would support the making of an application for a superannuation order under subsection 17(1A); and

     * (c) the defendant is, or has been, a member of a superannuation scheme;

    * the court may, by order, direct that the property, or such part of the property as is specified in the order, is not to be disposed of, or otherwise dealt with, by any person except in the manner and circumstances (if any) specified in the order.

    * (2) A restraining order must not be made against a person's property to any extent greater than is necessary to ensure the recovery of any amount payable, or reasonably likely to be payable, by the defendant under a recovery order.

    * (3) Subsection (2) does not prevent the court from making a restraining order against a person's property, being property whose value is more than the amount payable, or reasonably likely to be payable, by the defendant under a recovery order if there is no other property of sufficient value in respect of which the court can make a restraining order.

    * (4) A court may make a restraining order against property whether or not there is any risk of the property being disposed of, or otherwise dealt with, in a manner that would defeat the operation of this Act.

    * (6) A court may refuse to make a restraining order if the Commonwealth refuses or fails to give the court such undertakings as the court considers appropriate with respect to the payment of damages or costs, or both, in relation to the making and operation of the order.

##### 26  Restraining order may be subject to conditions

     * (b) the person's taxed legal expenses in defending a criminal charge;

     * (c) a specified debt incurred by the person in good faith (being a debt to which neither paragraph (a) or (b) applies).
