Article 5

The Commission shall-- 

    * (_a_)	subject to the provisions of sub-paragraph (_b_) of this Article, ensure that, so far as is practicable, phosphate obtained from Christmas Island shall be disposed of in Australia and New Zealand in conjunction with phosphate supplied by the British Phosphate Commissioners from Nauru and Ocean Island and other sources in such a manner as to give the lowest possible average c.i.f. cost for phosphate supplied to Australia and New Zealand; 

    * (_b_)	fix the f.o.b. price of phosphate supplied to Australia and New Zealand on a basis which will cover working expenses, depreciation, the administration expenses of the Commission (including the remuneration of the Commissioners), interest on moneys provided by the said Governments under the Christmas Island Agreement 1949 or under this Agreement, or borrowed under the Christmas Island Agreement 1949 or under Article 7 of this Agreement, contributions to any sinking fund for the redemption of such moneys, and the payment of the amounts referred to in Article 6 of this Agreement, the amounts payable by the Commission under Article 9 of this Agreement, and such other charges as the said Governments may agree upon;

    * (_g_)	as soon as possible after the end of the Commission's financial year, which shall run from the first day of July to the thirtieth day of June in each year, prepare and furnish to each of the said Governments, in respect of that financial year, a report of its activities and a financial statement duly audited by auditors approved by the said Governments; and 

    * (_h_)	do such other things as are incidental to the things which it is expressly authorized to do and which are necessary or expedient for carrying out its functions. 

Article 6

1.	For the purpose of recouping the expenses incurred by the said Governments or by either of them in connection with the placing of Christmas Island under the authority of the Commonwealth of Australia, together with interest thereon at such rate as the said Governments may from time to time jointly determine, the said Governments may from time to time jointly determine an amount to be paid to them by the Commission in respect of each ton of phosphate exported from Christmas Island, and shall direct the time at which and the manner in which those payments are to be made by the Commission. 

2.	Unless and until otherwise agreed by the said Governments, the amount to be paid in accordance with the last preceding paragraph in respect of each ton of phosphate exported from Christmas Island shall be eight shillings (8/-) sterling. 

3.	After the expenses referred to in paragraph 1 of this Article together with interest thereon as provided in that paragraph have been recouped, the Commission shall create a special fund (in this Article called "the fund") for the purpose of accumulating moneys to meet the cost of discharging the obligations towards inhabitants of the Island which fall upon the Government of Australia as a consequence of the cessation of the phosphate industry and such other residual liabilities as the two Governments agree in accordance with paragraph 7 of this Article fall upon the Government of Australia as a consequence of that cessation. 

4.	The Commission shall transfer to the fund annually an amount calculated at such rate per ton of phosphate exported from Christmas Island as the said Governments from time to time jointly determine. 

5.	Unless and until otherwise agreed by the said Governments, the amount to be paid by the Commission to the fund shall be calculated at the same rate per ton as was applicable under paragraphs 1 and 2 of this Article immediately before the final payment was made by way of recoupment of the expenses referred to in paragraph 1 of this Article, together with interest thereon as provided in that paragraph. 

6.	Moneys standing to the credit of the fund shall be invested in securities approved by the said Governments and interest earned from the investment of the moneys shall form part of the fund. 

7.	Immediately prior to the Commission ceasing to function, the two Governments shall consult for the purpose of assessing what part of the fund should be applied to meeting the cost of discharging the obligations towards inhabitants of the Island which fall upon the Government of Australia as a consequence of the cessation of the phosphate industry and such other residual liabilities as the two Governments agree fall upon the Government of Australia as a consequence of that cessation. 

8.	Such part of the fund as has been so assessed shall be paid or transferred to the Government of Australia for that purpose and the balance of the fund shall thereupon be divided equally between the two Governments. 	

9.	If at any time thereafter it is agreed by the two Governments that the portion of the fund so paid or transferred to the Government of Australia under the provisions of the last preceding paragraph is greater than is required to meet the costs for which it was so paid or transferred that excess shall similarly be divided between the two Governments. 

10.  In addition to the payments provided for by the preceding provisions of this Article, the said Governments may, for any other purposes agreed upon by them, from time to time jointly determine that an amount shall be paid to them by the Commission in respect of each ton of phosphate exported from Christmas Island and may direct the time at which and the manner in which those payments are to be made by the Commission. 

Article 7

1.	Subject to the next succeeding paragraph, the said Governments shall, from time to time and upon such terms as are jointly agreed upon, make available to the Commission, in equal shares, such moneys as the said Governments consider necessary for additional capital funds, working expenses or other purposes approved by them. 

2.	The said Governments may authorize the Commission to borrow moneys in such manner and up to such limits as the said Governments may from time to time agree. 

Article 8

Any surplus funds which the Commission has accumulated, or may from time to time accumulate, through the sale of phosphate or by other means or circumstances (other than the special fund provided for in Article 6 of this Agreement) shall, if and as the said Governments jointly so direct from time to time, be paid to the said Governments in equal shares but, subject to any such direction, the surplus funds may be used by the Commission for the working of the said property. 

Article 9

1.	So long as the Commission continues to function, the Commission shall meet the net expenditure incurred by the Government of Australia in administering Christmas Island. 

2.	For this purpose, the Government of Australia may require the Commission to make advance payments on the understanding that an adjustment will be made as soon as convenient after the thirtieth day of June in each year on the basis of a statement supplied by that Government which shows in reasonable detail the net cost to that Government of administering Christmas Island and which is duly certified by the Auditor-General for the Commonwealth of Australia. The Government of Australia will, at the same time, supply a copy of that statement to the Government of New Zealand. 

3.	The cost of the establishment or maintenance on Christmas Island of any aerodrome or works shall not, to the extent that that aerodrome or those works go beyond the reasonable requirements of the administration of Christmas Island, be payable by the Commission. 

Article 10

1.	The Commission shall continue to enjoy the same exemptions from income tax and land tax as it enjoyed under the legislation of the Commonwealth of Australia and New Zealand immediately before this Agreement came into force, and shall not be liable to pay income tax or land tax under any law of Christmas Island. 

2.	No duties of customs shall be imposed under any law of the Commonwealth of Australia or of Christmas Island on, or in respect of, the importation of goods into Christmas Island by the Commission, other than goods imported for the purposes of resale by the Commission. 

3.	No royalty, tax, duty, levy or charge shall be imposed under any law of the Commonwealth of Australia or of Christmas Island on, or in respect of,-- 

    * (_a_)	the production of phosphate in Christmas Island; or 

    * (_b_)	the export of phosphate from Christmas Island to Australia or New Zealand. 

4.	Nothing in this Article shall affect the provisions of Articles 5, 6 or 9 of this Agreement. 

Article 11

The Government of Australia will not, unless the said Governments otherwise agree, establish, or promote the establishment of, an industry on Christmas Island which is likely to affect the phosphate industry on Christmas Island prejudicially. 

Article 12

The Government of Australia will consult with the Government of New Zealand in the exercise of its administrative authority over Christmas Island in any matters, including the erection of any aerodrome or defence or other works, which materially affect the working of the said property by the Commission. 

Article 13

1.	Subject to the provisions of this Agreement and to general directions on policy given to the Commission by the said Governments jointly, the management and control of the working of the said property shall be left in the hands of the Commission. 

2.	The said Governments agree to join in the giving of all directions and to take any other action necessary for the purpose of ensuring the performance by the Commission of its responsibilities and duties as set out in this Agreement. 

Article 14

1.	This Agreement shall come into force on the date on which Christmas Island is placed under the authority of the Commonwealth of Australia, and shall, unless otherwise agreed between the said Governments, and except for paragraphs 8 and 9 of Article 6, terminate when, in the opinion of the said Governments, the phosphate on Christmas Island is commercially exhausted, or when the Commission ceases to function, whichever is the later. 

2.	This Agreement shall be subject to review at the instance of either of the said Governments upon notice being given to the other Government.
