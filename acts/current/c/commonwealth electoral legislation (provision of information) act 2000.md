#### No. 127, 2000

### An Act to provide for the use of information provided under the Commonwealth Electoral Act 1918, and for other purposes

[_Assented to 26 October 2000_]

### The Parliament of Australia enacts: 

##### 1  Short title

  * This Act may be cited as the _Commonwealth Electoral Legislation (Provision of Information) Act 2000_.

##### 2  Commencement

  * This Act commences on the day on which it receives the Royal Assent.

##### 3  Validation of provision of information

  * (1) This section applies to information where:

   * (a) the Electoral Commission has provided the information on a tape or disk to a person who, at the time the information was provided, was a prescribed authority (within the meaning of subsection 91(10) of the _Commonwealth Electoral Act 1918_); and

   * (b) the information was provided under an agreement entered into, on or before 9 May 2000, between the person (or the relevant Agency or authority) and the Electoral Commission; and

   * (c) the information was provided by the Electoral Commission on or before 8 June 2000.

  * (2) If this section applies to information, then for all purposes:

   * (a) the information is taken to have been provided under paragraph 91(4A)(e) of the _Commonwealth Electoral Act 1918_; and

   * (b) any use of the information by the person (or the relevant Agency or authority) on or before 30 June 2000 is taken to be use for a purpose that is a permitted purpose in relation to the person (or the relevant Agency or authority); and

   * (c) any purposes prescribed, after 30 June 2000, for the purposes of paragraph 91A(2A)(c) of the _Commonwealth Electoral Act 1918_ are taken to apply to use of the information in the same way as they would to use of information provided under paragraph 91(4A)(e) of the _Commonwealth Electoral Act 1918_ immediately after 30 June 2000.

  * (3) If this section applies to information and the information has been incorporated with, or into, other information held by the person (or the relevant Agency or authority) in such a way that either:

   * (a) the information can no longer be identified as having been supplied by the Electoral Commission; or

   * (b) the information cannot be removed without rendering the other information unusable;

  * then, for all purposes, any use of the information by the person (or the relevant Agency or authority) whether before, on or after 30 June 2000 is taken to be use for a purpose that is a permitted purpose in relation to the person (or the relevant Agency or authority).

  * (4) Unless the contrary intention appears, an expression used in this section has the same meaning as in the _Commonwealth Electoral Act 1918_.
