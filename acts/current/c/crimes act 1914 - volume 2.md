     * (b) the degree of the suspect's alleged participation in the commission of the relevant offence;

     * (c) the age, physical health and mental health of the suspect, to the extent that they are known to the constable or can reasonably be discovered by the constable (by asking the suspect or otherwise);

     * (e) whether there is a less intrusive but reasonably practicable way of obtaining evidence tending to confirm or disprove that the suspect committed the relevant offence;

     * (f) any other matter considered relevant to balancing those interests.

    * (4) Without limiting the matters that the constable may take into account in considering, for the purposes of paragraph (3)(e), the intrusiveness of the forensic procedure, the constable must (where appropriate) take into account the religious beliefs of the suspect.

#### Division 4--Nonintimate forensic procedures on suspect by order of senior police officer

##### 23WM  Nonintimate forensic procedure may be carried out by order of senior police officer

    * (1) A person is authorised to carry out a nonintimate forensic procedure on a suspect by order of a senior police officer under section 23WN. The person is authorised to carry out the procedure in accordance with Division 6 and not otherwise.

    * (2) This Division does not authorise the carrying out of a forensic procedure on a suspect who is:

     * (a) a child; or

     * (b) an incapable person.

    * (2A) This Division does not authorise the carrying out of a forensic procedure on a suspect if the procedure has been requested by:

     * (a) a foreign country (as contemplated by the _Mutual Assistance in Criminal Matters Act 1987_); or

     * (b) a foreign law enforcement agency.

    * (3) This Division does not authorise keeping a suspect in custody, in order to carry out a forensic procedure, after the expiration of the investigation period provided for by Part IC.

        * Note: If it is necessary to keep a suspect in custody after the expiration of the Part IC investigation period in order to carry out a forensic procedure, an order of a magistrate under Division 5 will have to be obtained to authorise this.

    * (4) Nothing in this Part or Part IC prevents the carrying out of a forensic procedure, in accordance with a constable's order under section 23WN, during the investigation period provided for by Part IC. However, neither carrying out the forensic procedure, nor any delays associated with carrying out the forensic procedure, operate to extend the investigation period provided for by Part IC.

        * Note: By contrast, the carrying out of a forensic procedure in accordance with a magistrate's order under Division 5, and associated delays, may delay the expiration of the investigation period provided for by Part IC.

##### 23WN  Circumstances in which senior police officer may order nonintimate forensic procedures

    * A senior police officer may order the carrying out of a nonintimate forensic procedure on a suspect who is in custody if: 

     * (a) the suspect has been asked under Division 3 to consent to the carrying out of the forensic procedure; and

     * (b) the suspect has not consented; and

     * (c) the senior police officer is satisfied as required by section 23WO.

##### 23WO  Matters to be considered by senior police officer before ordering forensic procedure

    * (1) The senior police officer must be satisfied on the balance of probabilities that:

     * (a) the suspect is in the lawful custody of a constable; and

     * (b) there are reasonable grounds to believe that the suspect committed a relevant offence; and

     * (c) there are reasonable grounds to believe that the forensic procedure is likely to produce evidence tending to confirm or disprove that the suspect committed a relevant offence; and

     * (d) the carrying out of the forensic procedure without consent is justified in all the circumstances.

    * (2) In determining whether the carrying out of the forensic procedure without consent is justified in all the circumstances, the senior police officer must balance the public interest in obtaining evidence tending to confirm or disprove that the suspect committed the offence concerned against the public interest in upholding the physical integrity of the suspect.

    * (3) In balancing those interests, the senior police officer must have regard to the following matters:

     * (a) the seriousness of the circumstances surrounding the commission of the relevant offence and the gravity of the relevant offence;

     * (b) the degree of the suspect's alleged participation in the commission of the relevant offence;

     * (c) the age, physical health and mental health of the suspect, to the extent that they are known to the senior police officer or can reasonably be discovered by the senior police officer (by asking the suspect or otherwise);

     * (e) whether there is a less intrusive but reasonably practicable way of obtaining evidence tending to confirm or disprove that the suspect committed the relevant offence;

     * (f) if the suspect gives any reasons for refusing to consent--the reasons;

     * (g) any other matter considered relevant to balancing those interests.

    * (4) Without limiting the matters that the senior police officer may take into account in considering, for the purposes of paragraph (3)(e), the intrusiveness of the forensic procedure, the senior police officer must (where appropriate) take into account the religious beliefs of the suspect.

##### 23WP  Record of senior police officer's order

    * (1) The senior police officer must, at the time of, or as soon as practicable after, make an order under section 23WN, make a record of:

     * (a) the order made; and

     * (b) the date and time when the order was made; and

     * (c) the reasons for making it;

    * and must sign the record.

    * (2) The senior police officer must ensure that a copy of the record is made available to the suspect as soon as practicable after the record is made.

#### Division 5--Forensic procedures on suspect by order of a magistrate

##### Subdivision A--General

##### 23WQ  Forensic procedure may be carried out by order of magistrate

    * A person is authorised to carry out a forensic procedure on a suspect by order of a magistrate under section 23WS or 23XA. The person is authorised to carry out the procedure in accordance with Division 6 and not otherwise.

##### 23WU  Application for order
