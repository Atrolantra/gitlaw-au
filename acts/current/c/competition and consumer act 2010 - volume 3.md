     * (c) the dominant purpose for which the conduct is engaged in is substantially related to the remuneration, conditions of employment, hours of work or working conditions of the employee, or any of the employees, covered by paragraph (a);

    * the persons covered by paragraph (a) do not contravene, and are not involved in a contravention of, subsection 45D(1) or 45DA(1) by engaging in the conduct.

    * Dominant purpose of conduct relates to environmental protection or consumer protection

    * (3) A person does not contravene, and is not involved in a contravention of, subsection 45D(1) or 45DA(1) by engaging in conduct if:

     * (a) the dominant purpose for which the conduct is engaged in is substantially related to environmental protection or consumer protection; and

     * (b) engaging in the conduct is not industrial action.

        * Note 1: If an environmental organisation or a consumer organisation is a body corporate:

         * (a) it is a "person" who may be subject to the prohibitions in subsections 45D(1) and 45DA(1) and who may also be covered by this exemption; and

         * (b) each of its members is a "person" who may be subject to the prohibitions in subsections 45D(1) and 45DA(1) and who may also be covered by this exemption.

        * Note 2: If an environmental organisation or a consumer organisation is not a body corporate:

         * (a) it is not a "person" and is therefore not subject to the prohibitions in subsections 45D(1) and 45DA(1) (consequently, this exemption does not cover the organisation as such); but

         * (b) each of its members is a "person" who may be subject to the prohibitions in subsections 45D(1) and 45DA(1) and who may also be covered by this exemption.

    * Meaning of** industrial action**--basic definition

    * (4) In subsection (3), **_industrial action _**means:

     * (a) the performance of work in a manner different from that in which it is customarily performed, or the adoption of a practice in relation to work, the result of which is a restriction or limitation on, or a delay in, the performance of the work, where:

      * (i) the terms and conditions of the work are prescribed, wholly or partly, by a workplace instrument or an order of an industrial body; or

      * (ii) the work is performed, or the practice is adopted, in connection with an industrial dispute; or

     * (c) a ban, limitation or restriction on the performance of work, or on acceptance of or offering for work, that is adopted in connection with an industrial dispute; or

     * (d) a failure or refusal by persons to attend for work or a failure or refusal to perform any work at all by persons who attend for work.

    * For this purpose, **_industrial body_** and **_workplace instrument_** have the same meanings as in the _Fair Work Act 2009_.

    * Meaning of **industrial action**--further clarification

    * (5) For the purposes of subsection (3):

     * (a) conduct is capable of constituting industrial action even if the conduct relates to part only of the duties that persons are required to perform in the course of their employment; and

     * (b) a reference to industrial action includes a reference to a course of conduct consisting of a series of industrial actions.

    * Subsections (1), (2) and (3) do not protect people not covered by them

    * (6) In applying subsection 45D(1) or 45DA(1) to a person who is not covered by subsection (1), (2) or (3) in respect of certain conduct, disregard the fact that other persons may be covered by one of those subsections in respect of the same conduct.

        * Note: Section 415 of the _Fair Work Act 2009_ limits the right to bring actions under the Competition Code in respect of industrial action that is protected action for the purposes of that section.

##### 45  Meaning of pyramid scheme

    * (1) A **_pyramid scheme_** is a scheme with both of the following characteristics:

     * (a) to take part in the scheme, some or all new participants must provide, to another participant or participants in the scheme, either of the following (a **_participation payment_**):

      * (i) a financial or nonfinancial benefit to, or for the benefit of, the other participant or participants;

      * (ii) a financial or nonfinancial benefit partly to, or for the benefit of, the other participant or participants and partly to, or for the benefit of, other persons;

     * (b) the participation payments are entirely or substantially induced by the prospect held out to new participants that they will be entitled, in relation to the introduction to the scheme of further new participants, to be provided with either of the following (a**_ recruitment payment_**):

      * (i) a financial or nonfinancial benefit to, or for the benefit of, new participants;

      * (ii) a financial or nonfinancial benefit partly to, or for the benefit of, new participants and partly to, or for the benefit of, other persons.

##### 46  Marketing schemes as pyramid schemes

    * (1) To decide, for the purpose of this Schedule, whether a scheme that involves the marketing of goods or services (or both) is a pyramid scheme, a court must have regard to the following matters in working out whether participation payments under the scheme are entirely or substantially induced by the prospect held out to new participants of entitlement to recruitment payments:

     * (a) whether the participation payments bear a reasonable relationship to the value of the goods or services that participants are entitled to be supplied with under the scheme (as assessed, if appropriate, by reference to the price of comparable goods or services available elsewhere);

     * (b) the emphasis given in the promotion of the scheme to the entitlement of participants to the supply of goods or services by comparison with the emphasis given to their entitlement to recruitment payments.

    * (2) Subsection (1) does not limit the matters to which the court may have regard in working out whether participation payments are entirely or substantially induced by the prospect held out to new participants of entitlement to recruitment payments.

        * Note: A pecuniary penalty may be imposed for a contravention of this subsection.

      * (i) a time is specified in the catalogue as the time after which the goods will not be sold at that price and that time has not passed; or

      * (ii) in any other case--the catalogue may reasonably be regarded as not outofdate; or

    * and includes such a price or representation that is partly obscured by another such price or representation that is written, stamped or located partly over that price or representation.

    * (3) If:

     * (a) a price or representation is included in a catalogue; and

     * (b) the catalogue is expressed to apply only to goods supplied at a specified location, or in a specified region;

    * the price or representation is taken, for the purposes of subsection (2)(d), not to have been made in relation to supply of the goods at a different location, or in a different region, as the case may be.

     * (b) the price or representation:

      * (i) is expressed as a price per unit of mass, volume, length or other unit of measure; and

##### 48  Single price to be specified in certain circumstances

     * (b) the promotion by any means of the supply to another person, or of the use by another person, of goods or services of a kind ordinarily acquired for personal, domestic or household use or consumption;

    * make a representation with respect to an amount that, if paid, would constitute a part of the consideration for the supply of the goods or services unless the person also specifies, in a prominent way and as a single figure, the single price for the goods or services.

        * Note: A pecuniary penalty may be imposed for a contravention of this subsection.

    * (2) A person is not required to include, in the single price for goods, a charge that is payable in relation to sending the goods from the supplier to the other person.

    * (3) However, if:

     * (a) the person does not include in the single price a charge that is payable in relation to sending the goods from the supplier to the other person; and

     * (b) the person knows, at the time of the representation, the minimum amount of a charge in relation to sending the goods from the supplier to the other person that must be paid by the other person;

    * the person must not make the representation referred to in subsection (1) unless the person also specifies that minimum amount.

        * Note: A pecuniary penalty may be imposed for a contravention of this subsection.

    * (4) Subsection (1) does not apply if the representation is made exclusively to a body corporate.

    * (4A) Subsection (1) does not apply if:

     * (a) the representation is in a class of representations prescribed by the regulations; and

     * (b) the conditions (if any) prescribed by the regulations in relation to representations in that class have been complied with.

        * Note: If the representation is in a class prescribed for paragraph (a) of this subsection and subsection (1) is complied with in relation to the representation, there is no need to also comply with any conditions prescribed for paragraph (b) of this subsection.

    * (5) For the purposes of subsection (1), the person is taken not to have specified a single price for the goods or services in a prominent way unless the single price is at least as prominent as the most prominent of the parts of the consideration for the supply.

    * (6) Subsection (5) does not apply in relation to services to be supplied under a contract if:

     * (a) the contract provides for the supply of the services for the term of the contract; and

     * (b) the contract provides for periodic payments for the services to be made during the term of the contract; and

     * (c) if the contract also provides for the supply of goods--the goods are directly related to the supply of the services.

    * (7) The **_single price_** is the minimum quantifiable consideration for the supply of the goods or services at the time of the representation, including each of the following amounts (if any) that is quantifiable at that time:

     * (a) a charge of any description payable to the person making the representation by another person (other than a charge that is payable at the option of the other person);

     * (b) the amount which reflects any tax, duty, fee, levy or charge imposed on the person making the representation in relation to the supply;

     * (c) any amount paid or payable by the person making the representation in relation to the supply with respect to any tax, duty, fee, levy or charge if:

      * (i) the amount is paid or payable under an agreement or arrangement made under a law of the Commonwealth, a State or a Territory; and

      * (ii) the tax, duty, fee, levy or charge would have otherwise been payable by another person in relation to the supply.

        * Example 1: A person advertises lounge suites for sale. Persons have the option of paying for fabric protection. The fabric protection charge does not form part of the single price because of the exception in paragraph (a).

        * Example 2: The GST may be an example of an amount covered by paragraph (b).

        * Example 3: The passenger movement charge imposed under the _Passenger Movement Charge Act 1978 _may be an example of an amount covered by paragraph (c). Under an arrangement under section 10 of the _Passenger Movement Charge Collection Act 1978_, airlines may pay an amount equal to the charge that would otherwise be payable by passengers departing Australia.

      * (i) in each other's presence at a place other than the business or trade premises of the supplier of the goods or services; or

     * whether or not they are the only negotiations that precede the making of the agreement; and

     * (c) the consumer did not invite the dealer to come to that place, or to make a telephone call, for the purposes of entering into negotiations relating to the supply of those goods or services (whether or not the consumer made such an invitation in relation to a different supply); and
