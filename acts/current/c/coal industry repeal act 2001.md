[_Assented to 28 April 2001_]

### The Parliament of Australia enacts: 

##### 1  Short title

   * This Act may be cited as the _Coal Industry Repeal Act 2001_.

   * This Act commences on a day or days to be fixed by Proclamation.

##### 3  Schedule(s)

##### 4  Dissolution of Joint Coal Board etc.

   * (1) The Joint Coal Board is dissolved in so far as it is constituted under the _Coal Industry Act 1946_.

   * (2) It is the intention of the Parliament that a law of New South Wales may:

     * (a) make provision for the transfer of the assets, rights and liabilities of the Joint Coal Board; and

     * (b) make provision for the transfer of the members of staff of the Joint Coal Board immediately before the dissolution of the Board; and

     * (c) make provision for any other matter that is incidental to the dissolution of the Joint Coal Board.

      * Note: Section 5 places a restriction on the transfer of Commonwealth records under such a law of New South Wales.

   * (3) In this section:

   * **_assets _**means any legal or equitable estate or interest (whether present or future and whether vested or contingent) in real or personal property of any description (including money), and includes securities, choses in action and documents.

   * **_Joint Coal Board_** means the body corporate constituted under:

     * (a) the _Coal Industry Act 1946_; and

     * (b) the _Coal Industry Act 1946_ of New South Wales.

   * **_liabilities_** means all liabilities, debts and obligations (whether present or future and whether vested or contingent).

   * **_rights_** means all rights, powers, privileges and immunities (whether present or future and whether vested or contingent).

##### 5  Commonwealth records

   * (1) This Act does not authorise a Commonwealth record (within the meaning of the _Archives Act 1983_) to be transferred or otherwise dealt with except in accordance with the provisions of the _Archives Act 1983_.

   * (2) A Commonwealth record (within the meaning of the _Archives Act 1983_) must not be transferred to a person under a law of New South Wales that makes provision for matters of a kind mentioned in subsection 4(2) of this Act unless the National Archives of Australia has given permission under paragraph 24(2)(b) of the _Archives Act 1983_.

##### 6  Workers' compensation schemes

   * (1) Any workers' compensation scheme established by the Joint Coal Board (within the meaning of section 4 of this Act) and in operation under section 26 of the _Coal Industry Act 1946_ immediately before the repeal of that Act is taken to have been established by the company nominated under clause 3 of Schedule 8 to the _Coal Industry Act 2001_ of New South Wales.

   * (2) This section does not limit section 4.

##### 7  Compensation for acquisition of property

   * (1) If:

     * (a) apart from this section, the operation of this Act would result in the acquisition of property from a person otherwise than on just terms; and

     * (b) the acquisition would be invalid because of paragraph 51(xxxi) of the Constitution;

   * the Commonwealth is liable to pay the person a reasonable amount of compensation in respect of the acquisition.

   * (2) If the Commonwealth and the person do not agree on the amount of the compensation, the person may institute proceedings in the Federal Court of Australia for the recovery from the Commonwealth of such reasonable amount of compensation as the court determines.
