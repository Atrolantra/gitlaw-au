## Chapter 5C--Managed investment schemes

### Part 5C.1--Registration of managed investment schemes

##### 601EA  Applying for registration

    * (1) To register a managed investment scheme, a person must lodge an application with ASIC.

    * (2) The application must state:

     * (a) the name, and the address of the registered office, of the proposed responsible entity; and

     * (b) the name and address of a person who has consented to be the auditor of the compliance plan.

    * (3) The applicant must have the consent referred to in paragraph (2)(b) when the application is lodged. After the scheme is registered, the applicant must give the consent to the responsible entity. The responsible entity must keep the consent.

    * (4) The following must be lodged with the application:

     * (a) a copy of the scheme's constitution;

     * (b) a copy of the scheme's compliance plan;

     * (c) a statement signed by the directors of the proposed responsible entity that:

      * (i) the scheme's constitution complies with sections 601GA and 601GB; and

      * (ii) the scheme's compliance plan complies with section 601HA.

        * Note: Section 601HC requires that the copy of the compliance plan be signed by the directors of the responsible entity.

##### 601EB  Registration of managed investment scheme

    * (1) ASIC must register the scheme within 14 days of lodgment of the application, unless it appears to ASIC that:

     * (c) the application does not comply with section 601EA; or

     * (d) the proposed responsible entity does not meet the requirements of section 601FA; or

     * (e) the scheme's constitution does not meet the requirements of sections 601GA and 601GB; or

     * (f) the scheme's compliance plan does not meet the requirements of section 601HA; or

     * (g) the copy of the compliance plan lodged with the application is not signed as required by section 601HC; or

     * (h) arrangements are not in place that will satisfy the requirements of section 601HG in relation to audit of compliance with the plan.

    * (2) If ASIC registers the scheme, ASIC must give it an ARSN.

    * (3) ASIC must keep a record of the registration of the scheme.

    * (4) For the purpose of determining whether subsection (1) is satisfied in relation to the scheme:

     * (a) references in Parts 5C.3, 5C.4 and 5C.5 to a registered scheme are taken to include a reference to the scheme; and

     * (b) references in those Parts to the responsible entity of a registered scheme are taken to include a reference to the proposed responsible entity of the scheme.

##### 601EC  All documents etc. lodged with ASIC to bear ARSN or ABN

    * After a managed investment scheme is registered, all documents relating to the scheme that are lodged with ASIC must set out:

     * (a) the scheme's ARSN; or

     * (b) if the last 9 digits of the scheme's ARSN are the same, and in the same order, as the last 9 digits of its ABN--the scheme's ABN.

        * Note: In any case where the scheme's ARSN would be used, the scheme's ABN may be used instead if section 1344 is satisfied.

##### 601ED  When a managed investment scheme must be registered

    * (1) Subject to subsection (2), a managed investment scheme must be registered under section 601EB if:

     * (a) it has more than 20 members; or

     * (b) it was promoted by a person, or an associate of a person, who was, when the scheme was promoted, in the business of promoting managed investment schemes; or

     * (c) a determination under subsection (3) is in force in relation to the scheme and the total number of members of all of the schemes to which the determination relates exceeds 20.

    * (2) A managed investment scheme does not have to be registered if all the issues of interests in the scheme that have been made would not have required the giving of a Product Disclosure Statement under Division 2 of Part 7.9 if the scheme had been registered when the issues were made.

    * (3) ASIC may, in writing, determine that a number of managed investment schemes are closely related and that each of them has to be registered at any time when the total number of members of all of the schemes exceeds 20. ASIC must give written notice of the determination to the operator of each of the schemes.

    * (4) For the purpose of this section, when working out how many members a scheme has:

     * (a) joint holders of an interest in the scheme count as a single member; and

     * (b) an interest in the scheme held on trust for a beneficiary is taken to be held by the beneficiary (rather than the trustee) if:

      * (i) the beneficiary is presently entitled to a share of the trust estate or of the income of the trust estate; or

      * (ii) the beneficiary is, individually or together with other beneficiaries, in a position to control the trustee.

    * (5) A person must not operate in this jurisdiction a managed investment scheme that this section requires to be registered under section 601EB unless the scheme is so registered.

    * (6) For the purpose of subsection (5), a person is not operating a scheme merely because:

     * (a) they are acting as an agent or employee of another person; or

     * (b) they are taking steps to wind up the scheme or remedy a defect that led to the scheme being deregistered.

    * (7) A person who would otherwise contravene subsection (5) because an interest in a scheme is held in trust for 2 or more beneficiaries (see paragraph (4)(b)) does not contravene that subsection if they prove that they did not know, and had no reason to suspect, that the interest was held in that way.

##### 601EE  Unregistered schemes may be wound up

    * (1) If a person operates a managed investment scheme in contravention of subsection 601ED(5), the following may apply to the Court to have the scheme wound up:

     * (a) ASIC;

     * (b) the person operating the scheme;

     * (c) a member of the scheme.

    * (2) The Court may make any orders it considers appropriate for the winding up of the scheme.

     * (g) the appointment of a responsible entity for the scheme were the election of a director of the company; and

     * (h) the scheme's constitution were the company's constitution.

        * Note 1: Paragraph (g): See subsection 610(2).

        * Note 2: Section 9 defines **_voting interest_** in a managed investment scheme.

    * (2) The regulations may modify the operation of this Chapter as it applies in relation to the acquisition of interests in listed managed investment schemes.

##### 605  Classes of securities

    * (1) Takeover bids are made for securities within a particular class. Similarly, compulsory acquisition and buyout rights operate on securities within a particular class.

    * (2) For the purposes of this Chapter and Chapters 6A and 6C, securities are not taken to be different classes merely because:

     * (a) some of the securities are fullypaid and others are partlypaid; or

     * (b) different amounts are paid up or remain unpaid on the securities.

### Part 6.1--Prohibited acquisitions of relevant interests in voting shares

##### 606  Prohibition on certain acquisitions of relevant interests in voting shares

    * Acquisition of relevant interests in voting shares through transaction entered into by or on behalf of person acquiring relevant interest

    * (1) A person must not acquire a relevant interest in issued voting shares in a company if:

     * (a) the company is:

      * (i) a listed company; or

      * (ii) an unlisted company with more than 50 members; and

     * (b) the person acquiring the interest does so through a transaction in relation to securities entered into by or on behalf of the person; and

     * (c) because of the transaction, that person's or someone else's voting power in the company increases:

      * (i) from 20% or below to more than 20%; or

      * (ii) from a starting point that is above 20% and below 90%.

        * Note 1: Section 9 defines **_company_** as meaning a company registered under this Act.

        * Note 2: Section 607 deals with the effect of a contravention of this section on transactions. Sections 608 and 609 deal with the meaning of **_relevant interest_**. Section 610 deals with the calculation of a person's voting power in a company.

        * Note 3: If the acquisition of relevant interests in an unlisted company with 50 or fewer members leads to the acquisition of a relevant interest in another company that is an unlisted company with more than 50 members, or a listed company, the acquisition is caught by this section because of its effect on that other company.

    * (1A) However, the person may acquire the relevant interest under one of the exceptions set out in section 611 without contravening subsection (1).

        * Note: A defendant bears an evidential burden in relation to the matter in subsection (1A), see subsection 13.3(3) of the _Criminal Code_.

    * Acquisition of legal or equitable interest giving rise to relevant interest for someone else

    * (2) A person must not acquire a legal or equitable interest in securities of a body corporate if, because of the acquisition:

     * (a) another person acquires a relevant interest in issued voting shares in a company that is:

      * (i) a listed company; or

      * (ii) an unlisted company with more than 50 members; and

     * (b) someone's voting power in the company increases:

      * (i) from 20% or below to more than 20%; or

      * (ii) from a starting point that is above 20% and below 90%.

    * (2A) However, if the acquisition of the relevant interest is covered by one of the exceptions set out in section 611, the person may acquire the legal or equitable interest without contravening subsection (2).

        * Note: A defendant bears an evidential burden in relation to the matter in subsection (2A), see subsection 13.3(3) of the _Criminal Code_.

    * 50 member threshold

    * (3) In determining whether the company has more than 50 members for the purposes of subsection (1) or (2), count joint holders of a particular parcel of shares as 1 person.

    * Offers and invitations

    * (4) A person must not:

     * (a) make an offer, or cause an offer to be made on their behalf, if the person would contravene subsection (1) or (2) if the offer were accepted; or

     * (b) issue an invitation, or cause an invitation to be issued on their behalf, if the person would contravene subsection (1) or (2) if:

      * (i) an offer were made in response to the invitation; and

      * (ii) the offer were accepted.

    * Absolute liability offences

    * (4A) An offence based on subsection (1), (2) or (4) is an offence of absolute liability.

        * Note: For **_absolute liability_**, see section 6.2 of the _Criminal Code_.

    * Defences

    * (5) It is a defence to the prosecution of a person for contravening subsection (1), (2) or (4) if the person proves that they contravened the subsection:

     * (a) because of inadvertence or mistake; or

     * (b) because the person was not aware of a relevant fact or occurrence.

    * In determining whether the defence is available, disregard the person's ignorance of, or a mistake on the person's part concerning, a matter of law.

        * Note: A defendant bears a legal burden in relation to a matter mentioned in subsection (5), see section 13.4 of the _Criminal Code_.

    * Extended meaning of acquiring relevant interests--conversions and increases in voting rights

    * (6) A person is taken for the purposes of subsection (1) or (2) to acquire a relevant interest in voting shares in a company if:

     * (a) securities in which the person already had a relevant interest become voting shares in the company; or

     * (b) there is an increase in the number of votes that may be cast on a poll attached to voting shares that the person already had a relevant interest in.

    * The acquisition occurs when the securities become voting shares or the number of votes increases.

        * Note: Some examples of cases to which this subsection applies are:

          * A person exercises a right to convert a nonvoting preference share into an ordinary share that carries votes.

          * A person pays up partlypaid shares with limited votes and this leads to an increase in the number of votes attached to the shares.

##### 607  Effect on transactions

    * A transaction is not invalid merely because it involves a contravention of section 606.

##### 608  Relevant interests in securities

    * Basic rule--relevant interest is holding, or controlling voting or disposal of, securities

    * (1) A person has a relevant interest in securities if they:

     * (a) are the holder of the securities; or

     * (b) have power to exercise, or control the exercise of, a right to vote attached to the securities; or

     * (c) have power to dispose of, or control the exercise of a power to dispose of, the securities.

    * It does not matter how remote the relevant interest is or how it arises. If 2 or more people can jointly exercise one of these powers, each of them is taken to have that power.

    * Extension to control exercisable through a trust, agreement or practice

    * (2) In this section, power or control includes:

     * (a) power or control that is indirect; and

     * (b) power or control that is, or can be, exercised as a result of, by means of or by the revocation or breach of:

      * (i) a trust; or

      * (ii) an agreement; or

      * (iii) a practice; or

      * (iv) any combination of them;

     * whether or not they are enforceable; and

     * (c) power or control that is, or can be made, subject to restraint or restriction.

    * It does not matter whether the power or control is express or implied, formal or informal, exercisable alone or jointly with someone else. It does not matter that the power or control cannot be related to a particular security.

    * Extension to relevant interests held through bodies corporate

    * (3) A person has the relevant interests in any securities that any of the following has:

     * (a) a body corporate, or managed investment scheme, in which the person's voting power is above 20%;

     * (b) a body corporate, or managed investment scheme, that the person controls.

    * Paragraph (a) does not apply to a relevant interest that the body corporate or scheme itself has in the securities merely because of the operation of that paragraph in relation to another body corporate or managed investment scheme.

    * (4) For the purposes of paragraph (3)(b), a person controls a body corporate if the person has the capacity to determine the outcome of decisions about the body corporate's financial and operating policies.

    * (5) In determining whether a person has this capacity:

     * (a) the practical influence the person can exert (rather than the rights they can enforce) is the issue to be addressed; and

     * (b) any practice or pattern of behaviour affecting the body corporate's financial or operating policies is to be taken into account (even if it involves a breach of an agreement or a breach of trust).

    * (6) The person does not control the body corporate merely because the person and an entity that is not an associate jointly have the capacity to determine the outcome of decisions about the body corporate's financial and operating policies.

    * (7) A person is not taken to control a body corporate merely because of a capacity they have if they are under a legal obligation to exercise that capacity for the benefit of:

     * (a) if the person is an individual--someone else; or

     * (b) if the person is a body corporate--someone other than its members.

    * Extension to control in anticipation of performance of agreements etc.

    * (8) If at a particular time all the following conditions are satisfied:

     * (a) a person has a relevant interest in issued securities;

     * (b) the person (whether before or after acquiring the relevant interest):

      * (i) has entered or enters into an agreement with another person with respect to the securities; or

      * (ii) has given or gives another person an enforceable right, or has been or is given an enforceable right by another person, in relation to the securities (whether the right is enforceable presently or in the future and whether or not on the fulfilment of a condition); or

      * (iii) has granted or grants an option to, or has been or is granted an option by, another person with respect to the securities;

     * (c) the other person would have a relevant interest in the securities if the agreement were performed, the right enforced or the option exercised;

    * the other person is taken to already have a relevant interest in the securities.

        * Note: Subsections 609(6) and (7) deal with specific situations in which the agreement will not give rise to a relevant interest.

    * Body corporate may have relevant interest in its own securities

    * (9) This section may result in a body corporate having a relevant interest in its own securities.

##### 609  Situations not giving rise to relevant interests

    * Money lending and financial accommodation

    * (1) A person does not have a relevant interest in securities merely because of a security interest taken for the purpose of a transaction entered into by the person if:

     * (a) the security interest is taken or acquired in the ordinary course of the person's business of the provision of financial accommodation by any means and on ordinary commercial terms; and

     * (b) the person whose property is subject to the security interest is not an associate of the person.

        * Note: Sections 11 to 17 define **_associate_**.

    * Nominees and other trustees

    * (2) A person who would otherwise have a relevant interest in securities as a bare trustee does not have a relevant interest in the securities if a beneficiary under the trust has a relevant interest in the securities because of a presently enforceable and unconditional right of the kind referred to in subsection 608(8).

        * Note: This subsection will often apply to a person who holds securities as a nominee.

    * Holding of securities by financial services licensee

    * (3) A financial services licensee does not have a relevant interest in securities merely because they hold securities on behalf of someone else in the ordinary course of their financial services business.

    * Shares covered by buybacks

    * (4) A person does not have a relevant interest in a company's shares if the relevant interest would arise merely because the company has entered into an agreement to buy back the shares.

    * Proxies

    * (5) A person does not have a relevant interest in securities merely because the person has been appointed to vote as a proxy or representative at a meeting of members, or of a class of members, of the company, body or managed investment scheme if:

     * (a) the appointment is for one meeting only; and

     * (b) neither the person nor any associate gives valuable consideration for the appointment.

    * Market traded options and derivatives

    * (6) A person does not have a relevant interest in securities merely because of:

     * (a) an market traded option over the securities; or

     * (b) a right to acquire the securities given by a derivative.

    * This subsection stops applying to the relevant interest when the obligation to make or take delivery of the securities arises.

        * Note: Without this subsection, subsection 608(8) would create a relevant interest from the option or contract.

    * Conditional agreements

    * (7) A person does not have a relevant interest in securities merely because of an agreement if the agreement:

     * (a) is conditional on:

      * (i) a resolution under item 7 in the table in section 611 being passed; or

      * (ii) ASIC exempting the acquisition under the agreement from the provisions of this Chapter under section 655A; and

     * (b) does not confer any control over, or power to substantially influence, the exercise of a voting right attached to the securities; and

     * (c) does not restrict disposal of the securities for more than 3 months from the date when the agreement is entered into.

    * The person acquires a relevant interest in the securities when the condition referred to in paragraph (a) is satisfied.

    * Preemptive rights

    * (8) A member of a company, body or managed investment scheme does not have a relevant interest in securities of the company, body or scheme merely because the company's, body's or scheme's constitution gives members preemptive rights on the transfer of the securities if all members have preemptive rights on the same terms.

    * Director of body corporate holding securities

    * (9) A person does not have a relevant interest in securities merely because:

     * (a) the person is a director of a body corporate; and

     * (b) the body corporate has a relevant interest in those securities.

    * Clearing and settlement facilities

    * (9A) The operator of a clearing and settlement facility (within the meaning of Chapter 7) does not have a relevant interest in securities merely because of its provision of facilities for the settlement of transactions.

    * Prescribed exclusions

    * (10) A person does not have a relevant interest in securities in the circumstances specified in the regulations. The regulations may provide that interests in securities are not relevant interests subject to specified conditions.

##### 610  Voting power in a body or managed investment scheme

    * Person's voting power in a body or managed investment scheme

    * (1) A person's **_voting power_** in a designated body is:

    * where: 

    * **_person's and associates' votes_** is the total number of votes attached to all the voting shares in the designated body (if any) that the person or an associate has a relevant interest in.

    * **_total votes in designated body_** is the total number of votes attached to all voting shares in the designated body.

        * Note: Even if a person's relevant interest in voting shares is based on control over disposal of the shares (rather than control over voting rights attached to the shares), their voting power in the designated body is calculated on the basis of the number of votes attached to those shares.

    * Counting votes

    * (2) For the purposes of this section, the number of votes attached to a voting share in a designated body is the maximum number of votes that can be cast in respect of the share on a poll:

     * (a) if the election of directors is determined by the casting of votes attached to voting shares--on the election of a director of the designated body; or

     * (b) if the election of directors is not determined by the casting of votes attached to voting shares--on the adoption of a constitution for the designated body or the amendment of the body corporate's constitution.

        * Note: The Takeovers Panel may decide that the setting or varying of voting rights in a way that affects control of a designated body is unacceptable circumstances under section 657A.

    * (3) If:

     * (a) a transaction in relation to, or an acquisition of an interest in, securities occurs; and

     * (b) before the transaction or acquisition, a person did not have a relevant interest in particular voting shares but an associate of the person did have a relevant interest in those shares; and

     * (c) because of the transaction or acquisition, the person acquires a relevant interest in those shares;

    * then, for the purposes of applying section 606 to the transaction or acquisition, the person's voting power is taken to have increased because of the transaction or acquisition from what it would have been before the transaction or acquisition if the votes attached to those shares were disregarded to what it was after the transaction or acquisition (taking the votes attached to those shares into account).

    * (4) Disregard the operation of section 613 in working out a person's voting power in a designated body.

    * When a designated body is a managed investment scheme

    * (5) For the purposes of the application of this section in relation to a designated body that is a managed investment scheme:

     * (a) a reference to voting shares in the designated body is taken to be a reference to voting interests in the scheme; and

     * (b) a reference to the election of directors of the designated body is taken to be a reference to:

      * (i) if the scheme is a registered scheme--the appointment of a responsible entity for the scheme; or

      * (ii) if the scheme is not a registered scheme--the appointment of a person to the office (by whatever name it is known) in relation to the scheme that corresponds most closely to the office of responsible entity of a registered scheme; and

     * (c) a reference to the designated body's constitution is taken to be a reference to the scheme's constitution.

    * Meaning of designated body

    * (6) In this section:

    * **_designated body_** means:

     * (a) a body; or

     * (b) a managed investment scheme.

### Part 6.2--Exceptions to the prohibition

##### 611  Exceptions to the prohibition

    * The following table sets out: 

     * (a) acquisitions of relevant interests in a company's voting shares that are exempt from the prohibition in subsection 606(1); and

     * (b) acquisitions of relevant interests in a company's voting shares resulting from acquisitions of legal or equitable interests in securities of a body corporate that are exempt from the prohibition in subsection 606(2).

        * Note: Some of the items in the table cover only activities in relation to the company itself (items 7, 8, 12 and 13) while the other items cover acquisitions in that company that may occur through activities in relation to other companies.

##### 612  Effect of noncompliance with takeover rules for exceptions 1 to 4

    * The exceptions in items 1 to 4 of the table in section 611 do not apply to a takeover bid if the bid is carried out in contravention of:

##### 613  Bidder not to exercise voting rights if failure to send bids for offmarket acquisition--exception 2 or 3

    * If the exception in item 2 or 3 of the table in section 611 applies to an acquisition onmarket during a takeover bid, the bidder is not entitled to exercise the voting rights attached to the shares if:

     * (a) the bid is an offmarket bid; and

     * (b) the bidder fails to send offers under the bid within 28 days after giving the bidder's statement to the target.

##### 615  Treatment of foreign holders under equal access issue--exception 10

    * The exception in item 10 of the table in section 611 applies even though the conditions set out in the item are not satisfied in respect of foreign holders of the company's securities if, under the terms of the offers:

     * (a) the company must appoint a nominee for foreign holders of the company's securities who is approved by ASIC; and

     * (b) the company must transfer to the nominee:

      * (i) the securities that would otherwise be issued to the foreign holders who accept the offer; or

      * (ii) the right to acquire those securities; and

     * (c) the nominee must sell the securities, or those rights, and distribute to each of those foreign holders their proportion of the proceeds of the sale net of expenses.

### Part 6.3--The different types of takeover bid

##### 616  Offmarket bids and market bids

    * (1) There are 2 kinds of takeover bid:

     * (a) an offmarket bid (for quoted or unquoted securities); or

     * (b) a market bid (only available for quoted securities).

        * Note: Although the prohibition in section 606 is against acquiring relevant interests in voting shares, a takeover bid may be made for any securities (for example, as a preliminary to compulsorily acquiring securities in that class under Part 6A.1).

    * (2) The following table shows where to find the provisions dealing with the main features of the offers that may be made under offmarket bids and market bids and the procedures to be followed:

### Part 6.4--Formulating the takeover offer

#### Division 1--General

##### 617  Securities covered by the bid

    * Offmarket bid

    * (1) An offmarket bid must relate to securities:

     * (a) any differences in the offers attributable to the fact that the number of securities that may be acquired under each offer is limited by the number of securities held by the holder;

     * (b) any differences in the offers attributable to the fact that the offers relate to securities having different accrued dividend or distribution entitlements;

     * (c) any differences in the offers attributable to the fact that the offers relate to securities on which different amounts are paid up or remain unpaid;

     * (d) any differences in the offers attributable to the fact that the bidder may issue or transfer only whole numbers of securities as consideration for the acquisition;

     * (e) any additional cash amount offered to holders instead of the fraction of a security that they would otherwise be offered.

    * Foreign holders

    * (3) If the consideration for the bid includes an offer of securities, the securities do not need to be offered to foreign holders of the target's securities if under the terms of the bid:

        * Note: Sections 650B and 651A deal with variations of the consideration offered under the bid.

    * Market bid--cash only

    * (2) As the offers under a market bid for securities are made through a prescribed financial market, the bidder must offer to acquire the securities for a cash sum only for each security.

    * All bids--minimum consideration if bidder purchased securities in the 4 months before the bid

    * (3) The consideration offered for securities in the bid class under a takeover bid must equal or exceed the maximum consideration that the bidder or an associate provided, or agreed to provide, for a security in the bid class under any purchase or agreement during the 4 months before the date of the bid.

    * (4) For the purposes of subsection (3), the consideration offered or provided for a security is:

     * (a) if the consideration offered or provided is a cash sum only--the amount of that cash sum; or

     * (b) if the consideration offered or provided does not include a cash sum--the value of that consideration; or

     * (c) if the consideration offered or provided is a cash sum and other consideration--the sum of the amount of the cash sum and the value of the other consideration.

    * The value of consideration that is not a cash sum is to be ascertained as at the time the relevant offer, purchase or agreement is made.

    * (5) If:
