      * (ii) has given false or misleading information in purported compliance with those obligations; or

     * (e) the defendant:

    * (5) This section does not apply if the defendant proves that he or she had no reasonable grounds for suspecting that the money or property was derived or realised, directly or indirectly, from some form of unlawful activity.

        * Note: A defendant bears a legal burden in relation to the matter in subsection (5) (see section 13.4).

##### 400.10  Mistake of fact as to the value of money or property

    * (1) A person is not criminally responsible for an offence against section 400.3, 400.4, 400.5, 400.6, 400.7 or 400.9 in relation to money or property if:

     * (a) at or before the time of dealing with the money or property, the person considered what was the value of the money or property, and was under a mistaken but reasonable belief about that value; and

     * (b) had the value been what the person believed it to be, the person's conduct would have constituted another offence against this Division for which the maximum penalty, in penalty units, is less than the maximum penalty, in penalty units, for the offence charged.

        * Example: Assume that a person deals with money or property that is the proceeds of crime. While the person believes it to be proceeds of crime, he or she is under a mistaken but reasonable belief that it is worth $90,000 when it is in fact worth $120,000.

        * That belief is a defence to an offence against subsection 400.4(1) (which deals with money or property of a value of $100,000 or more). However, the person would be guilty of an offence against subsection 400.5(1) (which deals with money or property of a value of $10,000 or more). Section 400.14 allows for an alternative verdict of guilty of an offence against subsection 400.5(1).

        * Note: A defendant bears an evidential burden in relation to the matter in subsection (1) (see subsection 13.3(3)).

    * (2) A person may be regarded as having considered what the value of the money or property was if:

     * (a) he or she had considered, on a previous occasion, what the value of the money or property was in the circumstances surrounding that occasion; and

     * (b) he or she honestly and reasonably believed that the circumstances surrounding the present occasion were the same, or substantially the same, as those surrounding the previous occasion.

##### 400.11  Proof of certain matters relating to kinds of offences not required

    * In a prosecution for an offence against a provision of this Division, it is not necessary to prove the existence of any fault element in relation to any of the following:

     * (a) whether an offence may be dealt with as an indictable offence;

     * (b) whether an offence is an indictable offence;

     * (c) whether an offence is a Commonwealth indictable offence;

     * (d) whether an offence is a foreign indictable offence;

     * (e) whether an offence is a State indictable offence;

     * (f) whether an offence is an  indictable offence;

     * (g) whether an offence is a  indictable offence.

##### 400.12  Combining several contraventions in a single charge

    * (1) A single charge of an offence against a provision of this Division may be about 2 or more instances of the defendant engaging in conduct (at the same time or different times) that constitutes an offence against a provision of this Division.

    * (2) If:

     * (a) a single charge is about 2 or more such instances; and

     * (b) the value of the money and other property dealt with is an element of the offence in question;

    * that value is taken to be the sum of the values of the money and other property dealt with in respect of each of those instances.

##### 400.13  Proof of other offences is not required

    * (1) To avoid doubt, it is not necessary, in order to prove for the purposes of this Division that money or property is proceeds of crime, to establish:

     * (a) a particular offence was committed in relation to the money or property; or

     * (b) a particular person committed an offence in relation to the money or property.

    * (2) To avoid doubt, it is not necessary, in order to prove for the purposes of this Division an intention or risk that money or property will be an instrument of crime, to establish that:

     * (a) an intention or risk that a particular offence will be committed in relation to the money or property; or

     * (b) an intention or risk that a particular person will commit an offence in relation to the money or property.

##### 400.14  Alternative verdicts

    * If, on a trial for an offence against a provision of this Division (the **_offence charged_**), the trier of fact:

     * (a) is not satisfied that the defendant is guilty of the offence charged; but

     * (b) is otherwise satisfied that the defendant is guilty of another offence against this Division for which the maximum penalty, in penalty units, is less than the maximum penalty, in penalty units, for the offence charged;

    * the trier of fact may find the defendant not guilty of the offence charged but guilty of the other offence, so long as the person has been accorded procedural fairness in relation to that finding of guilt.

##### 400.15  Geographical jurisdiction

    * (3) For the purposes of the application of subsection 13.3(3) to an offence, subsection (2) of this section is taken to be an exception provided by the law creating the offence.

    * Defence--ancillary offence

    * (4) A person is not guilty of an offence against this Division if:

     * (a) the alleged offence is an ancillary offence; and

     * (b) the conduct constituting the alleged offence occurs wholly in a foreign country, but not on board an Australian aircraft or an Australian ship; and

     * (c) the conduct constituting the primary offence to which the ancillary offence relates occurs, or is intended by the person to occur, wholly in a foreign country, but not on board an Australian aircraft or an Australian ship; and

     * (d) paragraph (1)(b) of this section does not apply (and would not apply if the conduct described in paragraph (c) of this subsection occurred as intended); and

     * (e) the person is neither:
