   * 1**  Short title **[_see_ Note 1]

   * This Act may be cited as the _Customs Undertakings (Penalties) Act 1981_.

   * 2**  Commencement **[_see_ Note 1]

   * This Act shall come into operation on the day on which the _Customs Amendment (Tenders) Act 1981 _comes into operation.

##### 2A  General administration of Act

   * The Chief Executive Officer of Customs has the general administration of this Act.

##### 3  Interpretation

   * (1) In this Act, unless the contrary intention appears:

   * **_Customs undertaking_** means an undertaking given under subsection 267(1) or 268(2) of the _Customs Act 1901_, and includes such an undertaking as varied.

   * **_item of a Customs Tariff_** and **_proposed item of a Customs Tariff_** have the same respective meanings as in Part XVI of the _Customs Act 1901_.

   * **_prescribed percentage_**, in relation to goods, means the prescribed percentage set out in the Customs undertaking that relates to the goods.

   * (2) For the purposes of this Act, where a Customs undertaking sets out the value of a unit of the goods to which the undertaking relates, the value of the goods shall be calculated in accordance with that value.

##### 4  Penalty

   * (1) Subject to subsection (2), where a person breaches a Customs undertaking given by him or her, there is payable by that person to the Commonwealth, by way of penalty, an amount equal to the prescribed percentage of the value of the goods to which the undertaking relates.

   * (2) Where a person who has given a Customs undertaking has, in partial compliance with the undertaking, entered goods for home consumption under an item, or proposed item, of a Customs Tariff to which the undertaking relates during the period, or each of the periods, specified in the undertaking, the penalty otherwise applicable under subsection (1) shall be reduced by an amount that bears to the amount of that penalty the same proportion as:

    * (a) where a particular quantity of goods was required to be so entered to comply fully with the undertaking--the quantity of goods so entered bears to that particular quantity; or

    * (b) where a quantity of goods of a particular value was required to be so entered to comply fully with the undertaking--the value of the goods so entered bears to that particular value.
