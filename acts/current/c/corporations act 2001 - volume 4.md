     * (b) a single trustee who was a trustee of the trust at a time when it had 2 or more trustees.

    * (2) Subject to subsections (3) and (4), during a period while this section applies to a trust, this Chapter applies to the trust as if the trustee or trustees of the trust from time to time during the period constituted a single legal entity (the **_notional entity_**) that remained the same for the duration of that period.

        * Note: So, for example, while this section applies to a trust, a licence granted under this Chapter to the trustees of the trust will continue in force, despite a change in the persons who are the trustees.

    * (3) During any period or part of a period while this section applies to a trust and the trust has 2 or more trustees, this Chapter applies to the trustees as mentioned in subsection (2), but it applies with the following changes:

     * (a) obligations that would be imposed on the notional entity are imposed instead on each trustee, but may be discharged by any of the trustees;

     * (b) any contravention of a provision of this Chapter, or a provision of this Act that relates to a requirement in a provision of this Chapter, that would otherwise be a contravention by the notional entity is taken (whether for the purposes of criminal or civil liability) to have been a contravention by each trustee who:

      * (i) aided, abetted, counselled or procured the relevant act or omission; or

      * (ii) was in any way knowingly concerned in, or party to, the relevant act or omission (whether directly or indirectly and whether by any act or omission of the trustee).

    * (4) During any period or part of a period while this section applies to a trust and the trust has only one trustee, this Chapter applies to the trustee as mentioned in subsection (2), but it applies with the following changes:

     * (a) obligations that would be imposed on the notional entity are imposed instead on that single trustee;

     * (b) any contravention of a provision of this Chapter, or a provision of this Act that relates to a requirement in a provision of this Chapter, that would otherwise be a contravention by the notional entity is taken (whether for the purposes of criminal or civil liability) to have been a contravention by that single trustee.

    * (5) Subsections (2), (3) and (4) have effect subject to:

     * (a) an express or implied contrary intention in a provision or provisions of this Chapter; and

     * (b) the regulations, which may exclude or modify the effect of those subsections in relation to specified provisions.

        * Note: The references in this section to providing a financial product to a person are not to be taken to imply that the provision of a financial product is not also the provision of a financial service (see the meaning of **_dealing_** in section 766C).

    * Acquiring a financial product or financial service as a retail client

    * (2) For the purposes of this Chapter, a person to whom a financial product or financial service is provided as a retail client is taken to acquire the product or service as a retail client.

    * Disposing of a financial product as a retail client

    * (3) If a financial product is provided to a person as a retail client, any subsequent disposal of all or part of that product by the person is, for the purposes of this Chapter, a disposal by the person as a retail client.

      * (ii) an RSA provider (within the meaning of the _Retirement Savings Accounts Act 1997_);

    * Offence proceedings--defendant bears evidential burden in relation to matters referred to in paragraphs (7)(a) to (d)

    * (8) In a prosecution for an offence based on a provision of this Chapter, a defendant bears an evidential burden in relation to the matters in paragraphs (7)(a) to (d) as if those matters were exceptions for the purposes of subsection 13.3(3) of the _Criminal Code_.

     * (b) the product or the service is one to which subsection (7) applies;

    * it is presumed that the product or service was provided to the person as a retail client unless the contrary is established.

        * Note 1: There is no such presumption in relation to the provision of a product or service that is or relates to a general insurance product, a superannuation product or an RSA product. Whether or not such a product, or a service relating to such a product, was provided to a person as a retail client is to be resolved as provided in subsection (5) or (6), as the case requires.

#### Division 3--What is a financial product?

##### Subdivision A--Preliminary

##### 762A  Overview of approach to defining what a financial product is

    * General definition

    * (1) Subdivision B sets out a general definition of **_financial product_**. Subject to subsections (2) and (3), a facility is a financial product if it falls within that definition.

    * Specific inclusions

    * (2) Subdivision C identifies, or provides for the identification of, kinds of facilities that, subject to subsection (3), are financial products (whether or not they are within the general definition).

    * Overriding exclusions

    * (3) Subdivision D identifies, or provides for the identification of, kinds of facilities that are not financial products. These facilities are not financial products:

     * (a) even if they are within the general definition; and

     * (b) even if they are within a class of facilities identified as mentioned in subsection (2).

##### 762B  What if a financial product is part of a broader facility?

    * If a financial product is a component of a facility that also has other components, this Chapter, in applying to the financial product, only applies in relation to the facility to the extent it consists of the component that is the financial product.

        * Note: So, e.g., Part 7.9 does not require disclosures to be made in relation to those other components.

##### 762C  Meaning of facility

    * In this Division: 

    * **_facility _**includes:

     * (a) intangible property; or

     * (b) an arrangement or a term of an arrangement (including a term that is implied by law or that is required by law to be included); or

     * (c) a combination of intangible property and an arrangement or term of an arrangement.

        * Note: 2 or more arrangements may be taken to constitute a single arrangement--see section 761B.

##### Subdivision B--The general definition

##### 763A  General definition of financial product

    * (1) For the purposes of this Chapter, a **_financial product_** is a facility through which, or through the acquisition of which, a person does one or more of the following:

     * (a) makes a financial investment (see section 763B);

     * (b) manages financial risk (see section 763C);

     * (c) makes noncash payments (see section 763D).

    * This has effect subject to section 763E.

    * (2) For the purposes of this Chapter, a particular facility that is of a kind through which people commonly make financial investments, manage financial risks or make noncash payments is a **_financial product _**even if that facility is acquired by a particular person for some other purpose.

    * (3) A facility does not cease to be a financial product merely because:

     * (a) the facility has been acquired by a person other than the person to whom it was originally issued; and

     * (b) that person, in acquiring the product, was not making a financial investment or managing a financial risk.

##### 763B  When a person makes a financial investment

    * For the purposes of this Chapter, a person (the **_investor_**) **_makes a financial investment_** if:

     * (a) the investor gives money or money's worth (the **_contribution_**) to another person and any of the following apply:

      * (i) the other person uses the contribution to generate a financial return, or other benefit, for the investor;

      * (ii) the investor intends that the other person will use the contribution to generate a financial return, or other benefit, for the investor (even if no return or benefit is in fact generated);

      * (iii) the other person intends that the contribution will be used to generate a financial return, or other benefit, for the investor (even if no return or benefit is in fact generated); and

     * (b) the investor has no daytoday control over the use of the contribution to generate the return or benefit.

        * Note 1: Examples of actions that constitute making a financial investment under this subsection are:

          * (a) a person paying money to a company for the issue to the person of shares in the company (the company uses the money to generate dividends for the person and the person, as a shareholder, does not have control over the daytoday affairs of the company); or

          * (b) a person contributing money to acquire interests in a registered scheme from the responsible entity of the scheme (the scheme uses the money to generate financial or other benefits for the person and the person, as a member of the scheme, does not have daytoday control over the operation of the scheme).

        * Note 2: Examples of actions that do not constitute making a financial investment under this subsection are:

          * (a) a person purchasing real property or bullion (while the property or bullion may generate a return for the person, it is not a return generated by the use of the purchase money by another person); or

          * (b) a person giving money to a financial services licensee who is to use it to purchase shares for the person (while the purchase of the shares will be a financial investment made by the person, the mere act of giving the money to the licensee will not of itself constitute making a financial investment).

##### 763C  When a person manages financial risk

    * For the purposes of this Chapter, a person **_manages financial risk_** if they:

     * (a) manage the financial consequences to them of particular circumstances happening; or

     * (b) avoid or limit the financial consequences of fluctuations in, or in the value of, receipts or costs (including prices and interest rates).

        * Note 1: Examples of actions that constitute managing a financial risk are:

          * (a) taking out insurance; or

          * (b) hedging a liability by acquiring a futures contract or entering into a currency swap.

        * Note 2: An example of an action that does not constitute managing a financial risk is employing a security firm (while that is a way of managing the risk that thefts will happen, it is not a way of managing the financial consequences if thefts do occur).

##### 763D  When a person makes noncash payments

    * (1) For the purposes of this Chapter, a person **_makes noncash payments_** if they make payments, or cause payments to be made, otherwise than by the physical delivery of Australian or foreign currency in the form of notes and/or coins.

        * Note: Examples of actions that constitute making noncash payments are:

          * (a) making payments by means of a facility for direct debit of a deposit account; or

          * (b) making payments by means of a facility for the use of cheques; or

          * (c) making payments by means of a purchased payment facility within the meaning of the Payment Systems (Regulation) Act 1998, such as a smart card; or

          * (d) making payments by means of traveller's cheques (whether denominated in Australian or foreign currency).

    * (2) For the purposes of this Chapter, the following are not **_making noncash payments_**, even if they might otherwise be covered by subsection (1):

     * (a) making payments by means of a facility in relation to which one of the following applies:

      * (i) there is only one person to whom payments can be made by means of the facility;

      * (ii) the facility is, or is of a kind, specified in the regulations as being a facility that is not to be covered by this section because of restrictions relating to the number of people to whom payments can be made by means of the facility, or relating to the number of persons who can use the facility to make payments;

     * (b) making payments by means of:

      * (i) a letter of credit from a financial institution; or

      * (ii) a cheque drawn by a financial institution on itself; or

      * (iii) a guarantee given by a financial institution.

##### 763E  What if a financial product is only incidental?

    * (1) If:

     * (a) something (the **_incidental product_**) that, but for this section, would be a financial product because of this Subdivision is:

      * (i) an incidental component of a facility that also has other components; or

      * (ii) a facility that is incidental to one or more other facilities; and

     * (b) it is reasonable to assume that the main purpose of:

      * (i) if subparagraph (a)(i) applies--the facility referred to in that subparagraph, when considered as a whole; or

      * (ii) if subparagraph (a)(ii) applies--the incidental product, and the other facilities referred to in that subparagraph, when considered as a whole;

     * is not a financial product purpose;

    * the incidental product is not a financial product because of this Subdivision (however, it may still be a financial product because of Subdivision C).

    * (2) In this section:

    * **_financial product purpose _**means a purpose of:

     * (a) making a financial investment; or

     * (b) managing financial risk; or

     * (c) making noncash payments.

##### Subdivision C--Specific inclusions

##### 764A  Specific things that are financial products (subject to Subdivision D)

    * (1) Subject to Subdivision D, the following are **_financial products_** for the purposes of this Chapter:

     * (a) a security;

      * (iii) an option to acquire, by way of issue, an interest or right covered by subparagraph (i) or (ii);

     * (ba) any of the following in relation to a managed investment scheme that is not a registered scheme, other than a scheme (whether or not operated in this jurisdiction) in relation to which none of paragraphs 601ED(1)(a), (b) and (c) are satisfied:

      * (i) an interest in the scheme;

      * (iv) issued by an employer to an employee of the employer;

     * (e) a life policy, or a sinking fund policy, within the meaning of the _Life Insurance Act 1995_, that is a contract of insurance, but not including such a policy:

      * (ii) to the extent that it provides for benefits, pensions or payments described in paragraph 11(3)(c) of the _Life Insurance Act 1995_; or

      * (iii) to the extent that it provides for the provision of a funeral benefit; or

      * (iv) issued by an employer to an employee of the employer;

     * (f) a life policy, or a sinking fund policy, within the meaning of the _Life Insurance Act 1995_, that is not a contract of insurance, but not including such a policy:

      * (i) to the extent that it provides for a benefit to be provided by an association of employees that is registered as an organisation, or recognised, under the _Fair Work (Registered Organisations) Act 2009_ for a member of the association or a dependant of a member; or

      * (ii) to the extent that it provides for benefits, pensions or payments described in paragraph 11(3)(c) of the _Life Insurance Act 1995_; or

     * (m) anything declared by the regulations to be a financial product for the purposes of this section.

        * Note: Even though something is expressly excluded from one of these paragraphs, it may still be a financial product (subject to Subdivision D) either because:

          * (a) it is covered by another of these paragraphs; or

          * (b) it is covered by the general definition in Subdivision B.

    * (1A) If a single contract of insurance provides 2 or more kinds of cover, paragraph (1)(d) applies separately in relation to that contract, in relation to each of those kinds of cover, as if the contract only provided that kind of cover.

        * Note: Because of this subsection (including as it is affected by subsection (1B)), a single contract of insurance may constitute 2 or more separate general insurance products.

    * (1B) The regulations may, in relation to a traditional trustee company service of a particular class, prescribe the person or persons to whom a service of that class is taken to be provided. This subsection does not limit (and is not limited by) subsection (2).

     * (b) the circumstances in which persons are taken to provide, or are taken not to provide, a financial service.

    * Exception for work ordinarily done by clerks or cashiers

    * (3) To avoid doubt, a person's conduct is not the provision of a **_financial service_** if it is done in the course of work of a kind ordinarily done by clerks or cashiers.

    * Meaning of **operating a registered scheme**

    * **	(4)	For the purposes of this section, a person is not **_operating a registered scheme_** merely because:

     * (b) could reasonably be regarded as being intended to have such an influence.

    * (1A) However, subject to subsection (1B), the provision or giving of an exempt document or statement does not constitute the provision of financial product advice.

    * (1B) Subsection (1A) does not apply for the purpose of determining whether a recommendation or statement of opinion made by an outside expert, or a report of such a recommendation or statement of opinion, that is included in an exempt document or statement is financial product advice provided by the outside expert.

    * (2) There are 2 types of financial product advice: personal advice and general advice.

    * (3) For the purposes of this Chapter, **_personal advice _**is financial product advice that is given or directed to a person (including by electronic means) in circumstances where:

     * (b) a reasonable person might expect the provider to have considered one or more of those matters.

    * **	**(4)	For the purposes of this Chapter, **_general advice _**is financial product advice that is not personal advice.

    * (5) The following advice is not financial product advice:

     * (a) advice given by a lawyer in his or her professional capacity, about matters of law, legal interpretation or the application of the law to any facts;

     * (b) except as may be prescribed by the regulations--any other advice given by a lawyer in the ordinary course of activities as a lawyer, that is reasonably regarded as a necessary part of those activities;

     * (c) except as may be prescribed by the regulations--advice given by a registered tax agent or BAS agent (within the meaning of the _Tax Agent Services Act 2009_), that is given in the ordinary course of activities as such an agent and that is reasonably regarded as a necessary part of those activities.

    * (6) If:

     * (a) in response to a request made by a person (the **_inquirer_**) to another person (the **_provider_**), the provider tells the inquirer the cost, or an estimate of the likely cost, of a financial product (for example, an insurance product); and

     * (b) that cost or estimate is worked out, or said by the provider to be worked out, by reference to a valuation of an item (for example, a house or car to which an insurance policy would relate), being a valuation that the provider suggests or recommends to the inquirer;

    * the acts of telling the inquirer the cost, or estimated cost, and suggesting or recommending the valuation, do not, of themselves, constitute the making of a recommendation (or the provision of any other kind of financial product advice) relating to the financial product.

    * (7) If:

     * (a) in response to a request made by a person (the **_inquirer_**) to another person (the **_provider_**), the provider tells the inquirer information about:

     * (b) the request could also have been complied with (but was not also so complied with) by telling the inquirer equivalent information about one or more other financial products;

    * the act of telling the inquirer the information does not, of itself, constitute the making of a recommendation (or the provision of any other kind of financial product advice) in relation to the financial product referred to in paragraph (a).

    * (8) Subsections (5), (6) and (7) are not intended to affect, in any way, the determination of whether situations not covered by those subsections do, or do not, constitute the provision of financial product advice.

     * (a) a document prepared, or a statement given, in accordance with requirements of this Chapter, other than:

    * (3A) For the purposes of subsection (3), a person (the **_agent_**) who deals in a product as an agent or representative of another person (the **_principal_**) is not taken to deal in the product on the agent's own behalf, even if that dealing, when considered as a dealing by the principal, is a dealing by the principal on the principal's own behalf.

    * (4) Also, a transaction entered into by a person who is, or who encompasses or constitutes in whole or in part, any of the following entities:

     * (a) a government or local government authority;

     * (b) a public authority or instrumentality or agency of the Crown;

##### 766D  Meaning of makes a market for a financial product

    * (1) For the purposes of this Chapter, a person **_makes a market_** for a financial product if:

     * (a) either through a facility, at a place or otherwise, the person regularly states the prices at which they propose to acquire or dispose of financial products on their own behalf; and

     * (b) other persons have a reasonable expectation that they will be able to regularly effect transactions at the stated prices; and

     * (a) the person is the issuer of the products; and

        * Note: Because of paragraph (a) (subject to regulations made for the purposes of paragraph (b)), the requirements of Part 7.7 relating to financial services disclosure need only be complied with before the product or interest is first held by the provider. However, because of paragraph (b), the provider will be subject to the licensing and related requirements of Part 7.6 for so long as they continue to hold the product or interest.

    * (3) However, the following conduct does not constitute providing a **_custodial or depository service_**:

     * (a) a particular condition had not been imposed on an exemption under paragraph (1)(a); or

     * (b) a particular declaration under paragraph (1)(b) had not been made;

    * that conduct does not constitute an offence unless, before the conduct occurred (in addition to complying with the gazettal requirement of subsection (2)), ASIC gave written notice setting out the text of the condition or the declaration to the person. In a prosecution for an offence to which this subsection applies, the prosecution must prove that this additional notification requirement was complied with before the conduct occurred.

    * **_modifiable provision_** means:

     * (a) section 205G and any of the provisions of Chapter 6, 6A, 6B, 6C, 6CA or 7; or

    * (2) Before, and at all times while, the participant is participating in the market, the market's operating rules must provide for ASIC, instead of the market licensee, to make decisions and to take action (or to require the market licensee to take action on ASIC's behalf) in relation to these matters, and matters related to these matters:

     * (a) the admission of the participant to the market; and

     * (b) the expulsion and suspension of the participant from the market; and

     * (c) the disciplining of the participant; and

     * (d) the participant's compliance with the operating rules or this Act, including:

      * (i) the method of determining whether the participant has complied with those rules or this Act; and

    * (6) To avoid doubt, subsection (1) does not authorise a market licensee to participate in its own market.

##### 798E  Other potential conflict situations

    * (1) The regulations may make provision in relation to the rules and procedures that are to apply in the case of conflicts, or potential conflicts, between the commercial interests of the licensee and the need for the licensee to ensure that the market operates in the way mentioned in paragraph 792A(a).

    * (2) In particular, such regulations may deal with the following:

     * (a) identifying when such a conflict, or potential conflict, is taken to arise;

     * (b) empowering ASIC, instead of the licensee, to make decisions and to take action under the market's operating rules in relation to such a conflict or potential conflict;

     * (c) empowering ASIC to require the licensee to take action under the market's operating rules (whether or not on ASIC's behalf) in relation to such a conflict or potential conflict.

        * Note: For fees in respect of ASIC performing this function, see Part 9.10.

     * (a) provide the Minister, on the following day, with a written explanation of the need for the rule; and

     * (b) amend or revoke the rule in accordance with any written directions of the Minister.

    * Minister's instruments are not legislative instruments

    * (6) None of the following is a legislative instrument:

    * (2) If, after receiving ASIC's advice and reasons, the entity does not take:

     * (a) in the case of a proposed direction to suspend dealings in the financial products--action to prevent such dealings; or

     * (b) in any other case--such other action as in ASIC's view is adequate to address the situation raised in the advice;

      * (i) who was a participant in the market at that time; or

      * (ii) who the client reasonably believed to be a participant in the market at that time and who was a participant in the market at some earlier time; and

     * (d) the client suffers a loss because of:

      * (i) if the client gave the participant money or other property--the defalcation or fraudulent misuse of the money or other property by the participant; or

      * (ii) if the client gave the participant authority over property--the fraudulent misuse of that authority by the participant.

    * (2) The compensation rules must provide that a claim relating to an alleged loss caused by defalcation or fraudulent misuse may be allowed even if:

     * (a) the person against whom the defalcation or misuse is alleged has not been convicted or prosecuted; and

     * (b) the evidence on which the claim is allowed would not be sufficient to establish the guilt of that person on a criminal trial in respect of the defalcation or fraudulent misuse.

    * (3) The compensation rules may exclude losses of a kind described above that occur in specified situations. However, the compensation arrangements will not be adequate unless the Minister is satisfied that those exclusions are appropriate.

##### 885D  Certain losses that are not Division 3 losses

     * (a) the transaction referred to in paragraph 885C(1)(b) could have been effected otherwise than through a financial market; and

    * (2) The compensation rules may provide for the amount of compensation payable in respect of a Division 3 loss to be reduced by reference to a right of setoff available to the claimant.

    * (3) The compensation rules may impose an upper limit on the amount of compensation to which a person is entitled in respect of a claim in particular circumstances, or an upper limit on the total amount of compensation to which persons are entitled in respect of claims referable to a particular event or circumstance.

    * (4) That upper limit may be specified in the compensation rules or determined by a method specified in the rules.

    * (5) The compensation rules must also provide for the payment to the claimant of interest at the rate applicable under the regulations on the amount of the actual pecuniary loss, or so much of that loss as from time to time has not been compensated by an instalment or instalments of compensation, in respect of the period starting on the day when the loss was suffered and ending on the day when the compensation, or the last instalment of compensation, is paid.

    * (6) The compensation rules may provide for what is to happen if there are insufficient funds to meet claims in respect of Division 3 losses and in respect of any other losses covered by the arrangements. For example, they may provide for the prioritisation of claims, or the apportionment of available funds between claims.

    * (1) A person (the **_provider_**) must only provide a financial service in this jurisdiction on behalf of another person (the **_principal_**) who carries on a financial services business if one or more of the following paragraphs apply:

     * (a) these conditions are satisfied:

      * (i) the principal holds an Australian financial services licence covering the provision of the service; and

      * (ii) the provider is an employee or director of the principal or of a related body corporate of the principal; and

      * (iii) the provider is not an employee or director, or authorised representative, of any other person who carries on a financial services business and who is not a related body corporate of the principal; and

      * (iv) the provider is not an employee or director, or authorised representative, of a related body corporate of a person of the kind mentioned in subparagraph (iii);

     * (b) these conditions are satisfied:

      * (i) the principal holds an Australian financial services licence covering the provision of the service; and

      * (ii) the provider is an authorised representative of the principal; and

      * (iii) the authorisation covers the provision of the service by the provider; and

      * (iv) in the case of a provider who is an employee or director of any other person (the **_second principal_**) who carries on a financial services business, or of a related body corporate of such a second principal--if the provider provides any financial services in this jurisdiction on behalf of the second principal, the provider does so as an authorised representative of the second principal;

     * (e) if the principal (rather than the provider) provided the service, the principal would not need an Australian financial services licence because the provision of the service would be exempt under subsection 911A(2).

        * Note 2: Failure to comply with this subsection is an offence (see subsection 1311(1)).

    * (2) Paragraphs (1)(a), (b) and (c) do not apply if the provider is a financial services licensee, unless the principal is an insurer and the provider is acting under a binder given by the principal.

    * (3) If, as mentioned in paragraph (1)(d), the provider holds their own Australian financial services licence covering the provision of the service, then, for the purposes of the other provisions of this Chapter, the service is taken to be provided by the provider (and not by the principal) unless regulations made for the purposes of this subsection provide otherwise.

##### 911C  Prohibition on holding out

    * A person must not hold out:

    * (3) If the applicant is not a single natural person, ASIC must be satisfied:

     * (a) that:

      * (i) if the applicant is a body corporate--there is no reason to believe that any of the applicant's responsible officers are not of good fame or character; or

      * (ii) if the applicant is a partnership or the trustees of a trust--there is no reason to believe that any of the partners or trustees who would perform duties in connection with the holding of the licence are not of good fame or character; or

     * (b) if ASIC is not satisfied of the matter in paragraph (a)--that the applicant's ability to provide the financial services covered by the licence would nevertheless not be significantly impaired.

    * (4) In considering whether there is reason to believe that a person is not of good fame or character, ASIC must (subject to Part VIIC of the _Crimes Act 1914_) have regard to:

     * (a) any conviction of the person, within 10 years before the application was made, for an offence that involves dishonesty and is punishable by imprisonment for at least 3 months; and

     * (d) any other matter ASIC considers relevant.

        * Note: Part VIIC of the _Crimes Act 1914 _includes provisions that, in certain circumstances, relieve persons from the requirement to disclose spent convictions and require persons aware of such convictions to disregard them.

##### Subdivision B--The conditions on the licence

##### 914A  The conditions on the licence

    * (1) Subject to this section, ASIC may, at any time, by giving written notice to a financial services licensee:

     * (a) impose conditions, or additional conditions, on the licence; and

     * (b) vary or revoke conditions imposed on the licence.

        * Note: Subsection 923B(3) restricts the circumstances in which ASIC can impose a condition authorising a person to assume or use a restricted word or expression under that section.

    * (2) ASIC may do so:

     * (a) on its own initiative; or

     * (b) if the licensee lodges with ASIC an application for ASIC to do so, which is accompanied by the documents, if any, required by regulations made for the purposes of this paragraph.

        * Note: For fees in respect of lodging applications, see Part 9.10.

    * (3) ASIC may only impose conditions or additional conditions, or vary the conditions, on the licence after giving the licensee an opportunity:

     * (a) to appear, or be represented, at a hearing before ASIC that takes place in private; and

     * (b) to make submissions to ASIC in relation to the matter.

    * This subsection does not apply to ASIC imposing conditions when a licence is granted.

    * (4) If the licensee, or a related body corporate, is a body (the **_APRA body_**) regulated by APRA, other than an ADI (within the meaning of the _Banking Act 1959_), then the following provisions apply:

     * (a) ASIC cannot:

      * (i) impose, vary or revoke a condition on the licence that, in ASIC's opinion, has or would have the result of preventing the APRA body from being able to carry on all or any of its usual activities (being activities in relation to which APRA has regulatory or supervisory responsibilities); or

      * (ii) vary a condition so that it would, in ASIC's opinion, become a condition that would have a result as described in subparagraph (i);

     * unless ASIC has first consulted APRA about the proposed action;

     * (b) if ASIC imposes, varies or revokes a condition on the licence and paragraph (a) does not apply to that action, ASIC must, within one week, inform APRA of the action that has been taken.

    * (5) If the licensee, or a related body corporate, is an ADI (within the meaning of the _Banking Act 1959_), then the following provisions apply:

     * (a) subject to paragraphs (b) and (c), the powers that ASIC would otherwise have under this section:

      * (i) to impose, vary or revoke a condition on the licence that, in ASIC's opinion, has or would have the result of preventing the ADI from being able to carry on all or any of its banking business (within the meaning of the _Banking Act 1959_); or

      * (ii) to vary a condition so that it would, in ASIC's opinion, become a condition that would have a result as described in subparagraph (i);

     * are instead powers of the Minister;

     * (b) the following provisions apply in relation to a power to which paragraph (a) applies:

      * (i) the procedures for the exercise of the power are the same as would apply if ASIC could exercise the power, except that the Minister must not exercise the power unless he or she has first considered advice from ASIC on the proposed action, being advice given after ASIC has consulted APRA about the proposed action;

      * (ii) ASIC (rather than the Minister) must still conduct any hearing required under paragraph (3)(a) and receive any submissions under paragraph (3)(b);

     * (c) if ASIC imposes, varies or revokes a condition on the licence and paragraph (a) does not apply to that action, ASIC must, within one week, inform APRA of the action that has been taken.

    * (5A) A failure to comply with a requirement of subsection (4) or (5) to consult or inform APRA about, or to consider advice from ASIC about, an imposition, variation or revocation of a condition does not invalidate the action taken.

    * (6) ASIC must ensure that the licence is subject to a condition that specifies the particular financial services or class of financial services that the licensee is authorised to provide.

    * (7) The financial services or class of financial services may be specified by reference to particular financial products, or classes of financial products.

    * (8) The licence is subject to such other conditions as are prescribed by regulations made for the purposes of this subsection. However, ASIC cannot vary or revoke those conditions.

      * (iii) becomes incapable of managing their affairs because of physical or mental incapacity; or

     * (c) a trustee that is a body corporate becomes an externallyadministered body corporate; or

     * (d) the trustees lodge with ASIC an application for ASIC to do so, which is accompanied by the documents, if any, required by regulations made for the purposes of this paragraph.

        * Note 1: For fees in respect of lodging applications, see Part 9.10.

        * Note 2: If there is only one trustee, subsection (1) will apply (if the trustee is a natural person), and subsection (3) will apply (if the trustee is a body corporate).

##### 915C  Suspension or cancellation after offering a hearing

    * (1) ASIC may suspend or cancel an Australian financial services licence (subject to complying with subsection (4)) in any of the following cases:

     * (a) the licensee has not complied with their obligations under section 912A;

     * (aa) ASIC has reason to believe that the licensee is likely to contravene their obligations under section 912A;

     * (b) ASIC is no longer satisfied of the matter in whichever of subsection 913B(2) or (3) applied at the time the licence was granted (about whether the licensee, or the licensee's representatives, are of good fame or character);

     * (c) a banning order or disqualification order under Division 8 is made against the licensee;

     * (d) a banning order or disqualification order under Division 8 is made against a representative of the licensee and ASIC considers that the representative's involvement in the provision of the licensee's financial services will significantly impair the licensee's ability to meet its obligations under this Chapter.

    * (2) ASIC may also cancel an Australian financial services licence (subject to complying with subsection (4)) if:

     * (a) the application for the licence was false in a material particular or materially misleading; or

     * (b) there was an omission of a material matter from the application.

    * (3) An Australian financial services licence is suspended or cancelled by ASIC giving written notice to the licensee.

    * (4) However, ASIC may only suspend or cancel an Australian financial services licence under this section after giving the licensee an opportunity:

     * (a) to appear, or be represented, at a hearing before ASIC that takes place in private; and

     * (b) to make submissions to ASIC on the matter.

##### 915D  Effect of suspension

    * (1) A suspended Australian financial services licence has no effect while it remains suspended.

    * (2) Subsection (1) has effect subject to section 915H.

##### 915E  Revocation of suspension

    * ASIC may at any time revoke the suspension of an Australian financial services licence by giving written notice to the licensee.

##### 915F  Date of effect and publication of cancellation or suspension

    * (1) A variation, suspension, revocation of a suspension, or cancellation, of an Australian financial services licence takes effect when the written notice of that action is given to the licensee.

    * (2) As soon as practicable after the notice is given to the licensee, ASIC must:

     * (a) publish a notice of the action in the _Gazette_; and

     * (b) if the licensee is a participant in a licensed market or a licensed CS facility--give written notice of the action to the operator of the market or facility.

    * A notice under this subsection must state when the action took effect.

##### 915G  Statement of reasons

    * A notice of suspension or cancellation given to a licensee under this Subdivision must be accompanied by a statement of reasons for the action taken.

##### 915H  ASIC may allow licence to continue in effect

    * In the written notice of suspension or cancellation that ASIC gives to the licensee, ASIC may specify that the licence continues in effect as though the suspension or cancellation had not happened for the purposes of specified provisions of this Act in relation to specified matters, a specified period, or both.

##### 915I  Special procedures for APRAregulated bodies

    * (1) If a financial services licensee, or a related body corporate, is a body (the **_APRA body_**) regulated by APRA, other than an ADI (within the meaning of the _Banking Act 1959_), the following provisions apply:

     * (a) ASIC cannot suspend or cancel the licensee's licence if doing so would, in ASIC's opinion, have the result of preventing the APRA body from being able to carry on all or any of its usual activities (being activities in relation to which APRA has regulatory or supervisory responsibilities), unless ASIC has first consulted APRA about the proposed action;

     * (b) if ASIC suspends or cancels the licensee's licence and paragraph (a) does not apply to that action, ASIC must, within one week, inform APRA of the action that has been taken.

    * (2) If:

     * (a) a financial services licensee is an ADI (within the meaning of the _Banking Act 1959_); or

     * (b) a related body corporate of a financial services licensee is an ADI (within the meaning of the _Banking Act 1959_), and cancellation or suspension of the licensee's licence would, in ASIC's opinion, have the result of preventing the ADI from being able to carry on all or any of its banking business (within the meaning of the _Banking Act 1959_);

    * the following provisions have effect: 

     * (c) subject to paragraph (d), the powers that ASIC would otherwise have under this Subdivision to cancel or suspend the licensee's licence, or to subsequently revoke a suspension to which this subsection applied, are instead powers of the Minister;

     * (d) the procedures for the exercise of a power to which paragraph (c) applies are the same as would apply if ASIC could exercise the power, except that the Minister must not exercise the power unless he or she has first considered advice from ASIC on the proposed action, being advice given after ASIC has consulted APRA about the proposed action;

     * (e) ASIC (rather than the Minister) must still conduct any hearing required under paragraph 915C(4)(a) and receive any submissions under paragraph 915C(4)(b).

    * (3) A failure to comply with a requirement of subsection (1) or (2) to consult or inform APRA about, or to consider advice from ASIC about, a cancellation or suspension, or a revocation of a suspension, of a licence does not invalidate the action taken.

##### 915J  Variation, suspension and cancellation only under this Subdivision

    * An Australian financial services licence cannot be varied, suspended or cancelled otherwise than under this Subdivision.

        * Note: The conditions on the licence can be varied under section 914A.

#### Division 5--Authorised representatives

##### 916A  How representatives are authorised

    * (1) A financial services licensee may give a person (the **_authorised representative_**) a written notice authorising the person, for the purposes of this Chapter, to provide a specified financial service or financial services on behalf of the licensee.

    * (2) The financial services specified may be some or all of the financial services covered by the licensee's licence.

    * (3) An authorisation under subsection (1) is void to the extent that it purports to authorise a person to provide a financial service:

     * (a) that is not covered by the licensee's licence; or

     * (b) contrary to a banning order or disqualification order under Division 8.

    * (3A) A person must not give a purported authorisation if that purported authorisation is void to any extent under subsection (3).

        * Note: Failure to comply with this subsection is an offence (see subsection 1311(1)).

    * (4) An authorisation may be revoked at any time by the licensee giving written notice to the authorised representative.

##### 916B  Subauthorisations

    * (1) Subject to subsection (3), an authorised representative of a financial services licensee cannot, in that capacity, make a person their authorised representative or an authorised representative of the licensee.

    * (2) A purported authorisation contrary to this section is void.

    * (2A) A person must not give a purported authorisation if that purported authorisation is contrary to this section.

        * Note: Failure to comply with this subsection is an offence (see subsection 1311(1)).

    * (3) A body corporate that is an authorised representative of a financial services licensee may, in that capacity, give an individual a written notice authorising that individual, for the purposes of this Chapter, to provide a specified financial service or financial services on behalf of the licensee, but only if the licensee consents in writing given to the body corporate.

    * (4) The financial services specified may be some or all of the financial services covered by the licensee's licence.

    * (5) The licensee may give consent under subsection (3) in respect of either a specified individual or a specified class of individuals (the membership of which might change from time to time).

    * (5A) If a licensee gives consent under subsection (3) to a body corporate, the licensee must keep a copy of the consent for 5 years after the day on which it ceases to have effect.

        * Note: Failure to comply with this subsection is an offence (see subsection 1311(1)).

    * (6) An individual who is authorised as mentioned in subsection (3) is an **_authorised representative_** of the relevant licensee.

    * (7) An authorisation of an individual as mentioned in subsection (3) may be revoked at any time by:

     * (a) the licensee; or

     * (b) the body corporate that gave the individual the authorisation;

    * giving written notice to the individual.

    * (8) If a person revokes the authorisation of an individual under subsection (7), that person must inform, in writing, the other person who could have revoked the authorisation.

    * (9) To avoid doubt, an authorisation given as mentioned in subsection (3) is taken, for the purposes of sections 916C to 916F, to be given by the body corporate, not the licensee.

##### 916C  Authorised representative of 2 or more licensees

    * (1) One person can be the authorised representative of 2 or more financial services licensees, but only if:

     * (a) each of those licensees has consented to the person also being the authorised representative of each of the other licensees; or

     * (b) each of those licensees is a related body corporate of each of the other licensees.

    * (2) A purported authorisation given in breach of this requirement is void.

    * (3) A person must not give a purported authorisation if that purported authorisation is in breach of this requirement.

        * Note: Failure to comply with this subsection is an offence (see subsection 1311(1)).

##### 916D  Licensees cannot authorise other licensees

    * (1) A financial services licensee cannot be the authorised representative of another financial services licensee.

        * Note 1: Instead, the first licensee could use their own licence to provide financial services on behalf of the second licensee (assuming that the first licensee's licence covered the provision of those services). See paragraph 911B(1)(d).

        * Note 2: There is an exception to this rule in section 916E.

    * (2) A purported authorisation given in breach of this requirement is void.

    * (2A) A person must not give a purported authorisation if that purported authorisation is given in breach of this requirement.

        * Note: Failure to comply with this subsection is an offence (see subsection 1311(1)).

    * (2B) The requirement in subsection (1) does not prohibit a financial services licensee from being an authorised representative in circumstances covered by section 916E.

        * Note: In a prosecution for an offence based on subsection (2A), a defendant bears an evidential burden in relation to the matters in this subsection. See subsection 13.3(3) of the _Criminal Code_.

    * (3) As well, an authorisation that starts to breach this requirement, because the person authorised is subsequently granted an Australian financial services licence, is void.

##### 916E  Licensees acting under a binder

    * (1) Despite section 916D, a financial services licensee (the **_authorised licensee_**) may be the authorised representative of another financial services licensee who is an insurer, if the authorised licensee acts under a binder given by the insurer.

    * (2) For all purposes connected with contracts that are risk insurance products, or with claims against the insurer, in respect of which the authorised licensee acts under the binder:

     * (a) the authorised licensee is taken to act on behalf of the insurer and not the insured; and

     * (b) if the insured in fact relied in good faith on the conduct of the authorised licensee, the authorised licensee is taken to act on behalf of the insurer regardless of the fact that the authorised licensee did not act within the scope of the binder.

##### 916F  Obligation to notify ASIC etc. about authorised representatives

    * (1) A person must lodge with ASIC a written notice (in accordance with subsection (2)), within 15 business days, if the person authorises a representative to provide a financial service as mentioned in section 916A or 916B.

        * Note: Failure to comply with this subsection is an offence (see subsection 1311(1)).

    * (1AA) Subsection (1) does not apply to an authorisation of a representative if:

     * (a) the authorisation is by a body corporate and is given as mentioned in section 916B; and

     * (b) the relevant consent under subsection 916B(5) was given in respect of a specified class of individuals of which the representative is a member; and

     * (c) the representative is an employee of the body corporate; and

     * (d) the only financial services that the representative is authorised to provide are either or both of the following:

      * (i) general advice that relates to financial products covered by regulations made for the purposes of this paragraph;

      * (ii) dealing in financial products covered by regulations made for the purposes of this paragraph.

        * Note 1: Regulations made for the purposes of paragraph (d) may be expressed to cover all financial products, or only one or more specified kinds of financial products.

        * Note 2: A defendant bears an evidential burden in relation to the matters in subsection (1AA). See subsection 13.3(3) of the _Criminal Code_.

    * (1A) A person who authorises an individual to provide a financial service on behalf of a financial services licensee as mentioned in section 916B must give the licensee written notice (in accordance with subsection (2)), within 15 business days of the individual being authorised to provide the financial service, if the licensee's consent to the authorisation was given in respect of a specified class of individuals.

        * Note: Failure to comply with this subsection is an offence (see subsection 1311(1)).

    * (2) The notice must include the following details:

     * (a) the name and business address of the representative;

     * (b) details of the authorisation, including the date on which it was made and what the representative is authorised to do on behalf of the relevant licensee;

     * (c) details of each other financial services licensee on behalf of whom the representative is an authorised representative.

    * (3) A person must notify ASIC, by lodging a written notice, within 10 business days if:

     * (a) the person authorised a representative under section 916A or 916B and there is a change in any details relating to the representative that are required to be included under subsection (2); or

     * (b) the person revokes an authorisation to which subsection (1) applied.

        * Note: Failure to comply with this subsection is an offence (see subsection 1311(1)).

    * (4) For the purposes of an offence based on subsection (3), strict liability applies to the physical element of circumstance of the offence, that the details mentioned in subsection (3) changed.

        * Note: For **_strict liability_**, see section 6.1 of the _Criminal Code_.

##### 916G  ASIC may give licensee information about representatives

    * (1) If ASIC considers it appropriate to do so, it may give information to a financial services licensee about a person who ASIC believes is, or will be, a representative of the licensee. However, ASIC may only do so if it believes, on reasonable grounds, that the information is true.

    * (2) A financial services licensee to whom the information is given may only make use of, make a record of, or give to another person, the information for a purpose connected with:

     * (a) the licensee making a decision about what action (if any) to take in relation to the representative, as a consequence of receiving the information; or

     * (b) the licensee taking action pursuant to such a decision.

        * Note: Failure to comply with this subsection is an offence (see subsection 1311(1)).

    * (3) A person to whom information has been given for a purpose or purposes under subsection (2) or this subsection, may only make use of, make a record of, or give to another person, that information for that purpose or any of those purposes.

        * Note: Failure to comply with this subsection is an offence (see subsection 1311(1)).

    * (4) A person has qualified privilege in respect of an act done by the person under subsection (2) or (3).

    * (5) A person to whom information is given in accordance with this section must not give any of the information to a court, or produce in a court a document that sets out some or all of the information, except:

     * (a) for a purpose connected with:

      * (i) a financial services licensee making a decision about what action (if any) to take in relation to the representative, as a consequence of receiving some or all of the information; or

      * (ii) a financial services licensee taking action pursuant to that decision; or

      * (iii) proving in a proceeding in that court that particular action taken by a financial services licensee in relation to the representative was taken pursuant to that decision; or

     * (b) in a proceeding in that court, in so far as the proceeding relates to an alleged breach of this section; or

     * (c) in a proceeding in respect of an ancillary offence relating to an offence based on this section; or

     * (d) in a proceeding about giving to a court false information some, at least, of which was the information given under this section.

    * (6) A reference in this section to a financial services licensee taking action in relation to a representative is a reference to the licensee:

     * (a) taking action by way of making, terminating or varying the terms and conditions of an agreement; or

     * (b) otherwise taking action in relation to an agreement;

    * to the extent that the agreement relates to the representative acting on behalf of the licensee.

    * (7) Subsection (5) also has the effect it would have if:

     * (a) a reference in it to a court were a reference to a court of an external Territory or of a country outside  and the external Territories; and

     * (b) paragraphs (5)(b) and (c) were omitted.

#### Division 6--Liability of financial services licensees for representatives

##### 917A  Application of Division

    * (1) This Division applies to any conduct of a representative of a financial services licensee:

     * (a) that relates to the provision of a financial service; and

     * (b) on which a third person (the **_client_**) could reasonably be expected to rely; and

     * (c) on which the client in fact relied in good faith.

    * (2) In this Division, a reference to a representative's conduct being **_within authority_** in relation to a particular financial services licensee is, subject to subsection (3), a reference to:

     * (a) if the representative is an employee of the licensee or of a related body corporate of the licensee--conduct being within the scope of the employee's employment; or

     * (b) if the representative is a director of the licensee or of a related body corporate of the licensee--conduct being within the scope of the director's duties as director; or

     * (c) in any other case--conduct being within the scope of the authority given by the licensee.

    * (3) If:

     * (a) a person is the representative of more than one financial services licensee in respect of a particular class of financial service; and

     * (b) the person engages in conduct relating to that class of service; and

     * (ba) the conduct relates to a particular kind of financial product prescribed by regulations made for the purposes of paragraph 917C(3)(ba); and

     * (c) any one or more of the licensees issues or transfers a financial product of that kind as a result of the conduct;

    * then, for the purposes of this Division:

     * (d) the person is taken, in respect of the conduct, to have acted **_within authority_** in relation to the licensee or to each licensee who issued or transferred a financial product of that kind as a result of the conduct; and

     * (e) the person is, in respect of the conduct, taken not to have acted **_within authority_** in relation to any licensee who did not issue or transfer a financial product of that kind as a result of the conduct.

##### 917B  Responsibility if representative of only one licensee

    * If the representative is the representative of only one financial services licensee, the licensee is responsible, as between the licensee and the client, for the conduct of the representative, whether or not the representative's conduct is within authority.

##### 917C  Representatives of multiple licensees

    * (1) This section applies if the representative is the representative of more than one financial services licensee.

    * Financial service covered by only one authority

    * (2) If:

     * (a) the representative is the representative of one of the licensees only in respect of a particular class of financial service; and

     * (b) the conduct relates to that class of service;

    * that licensee is responsible for the conduct, as between that licensee and the client, whether or not the conduct is within authority.

    *  Financial service covered by multiple authorities: conduct within authority for one or more of them

    * (3) If:

     * (a) the representative is the representative of more than one of the licensees in respect of a particular class of financial service; and

     * (b) the conduct relates to that class of service; and

     * (ba) the conduct relates to a particular kind of financial product prescribed by regulations made for the purposes of this paragraph; and

     * (c) the conduct is within authority in relation to:

      * (i) only one of those licensees (the **_authorising licensee_**); or

      * (ii) two or more of those licensees (the **_authorising licensees_**);

    * then: 

     * (d) if subparagraph (c)(i) applies--the authorising licensee is responsible for the conduct, as between that licensee and the client; or

     * (e) if subparagraph (c)(ii) applies--the authorising licensees are jointly and severally responsible for the conduct, as between themselves and the client.

    * All other cases

    * (4) In any other case, all of the licensees are jointly and severally responsible for the conduct, as between themselves and the client, whether or not the representative's conduct is within authority in relation to any of them.

##### 917D  Exception if lack of authority is disclosed to client

    * A financial services licensee is not responsible under section 917B or 917C for the conduct of their representative if: 

     * (a) the conduct is not within authority in relation to the licensee (or in relation to any of the licensees, if there were more than one); and

     * (b) the representative disclosed that fact to the client before the client relied on the conduct; and

     * (c) the clarity and the prominence of the disclosure was such as a person would reasonably require for the purpose of deciding whether to acquire the relevant financial service.

        * Note: A person must not hold out that conduct, or proposed conduct, of the person is within authority in relation to a particular financial services licensee, unless that is the case. See section 911C.

##### 917E  Responsibility extends to loss or damage suffered by client

    * The responsibility of a financial services licensee under this Division extends so as to make the licensee liable to the client in respect of any loss or damage suffered by the client as a result of the representative's conduct.

##### 917F  Effect of Division

    * (1) If a financial services licensee is responsible for the conduct of their representative under this Division, the client has the same remedies against the licensee that the client has against the representative.

    * (2) The licensee and the representative (along with any other licensees who are also responsible) are all jointly and severally liable to the client in respect of those remedies.

    * (3) However, nothing in this Division imposes:

     * (a) any criminal responsibility; or

     * (b) any civil liability under a provision of this Act apart from this Division;

    * on a financial services licensee that would not otherwise be imposed on the licensee.

    * (4) This Division does not relieve a representative of a financial services licensee of any liability they have to the client or the licensee.

    * (5) An agreement is void in so far as it purports to alter or restrict the operation of section 917B, 917C, 917D or 917E.

    * (6) However, subsection (5) does not apply to the extent that the agreement:

     * (a) provides for a representative of a financial services licensee to indemnify the licensee for a liability of the licensee in respect of the representative; or

     * (b) provides for a financial services licensee, for whom a representative acts, to indemnify another financial services licensee for a liability in respect of the representative.

    * (7) A financial services licensee must not make, or offer to make, an agreement that is, or would be, void under subsection (5).

#### Division 8--Banning or disqualification of persons from providing financial services

##### Subdivision A--Banning orders

##### 920A  ASIC's power to make a banning order

    * (1) ASIC may make a banning order against a person, by giving written notice to the person, if:

     * (a) ASIC suspends or cancels an Australian financial services licence held by the person; or

     * (b) the person has not complied with their obligations under section 912A; or

     * (ba) ASIC has reason to believe that the person is likely to contravene their obligations under section 912A; or

     * (bb) the person becomes an insolvent under administration; or

     * (c) the person is convicted of fraud; or

     * (d) ASIC has reason to believe that the person is not of good fame or character; or

     * (da) ASIC has reason to believe that the person is not adequately trained, or is not competent, to provide a financial service or financial services; or

     * (e) the person has not complied with a financial services law; or

     * (f) ASIC has reason to believe that the person is likely to contravene a financial services law; or

     * (g) the person has been involved in the contravention of a financial services law by another person; or

     * (h) ASIC has reason to believe that the person is likely to become involved in the contravention of a financial services law by another person.

    * (1A) In considering whether, at a particular time, there is reason to believe that a person is not of good fame or character, ASIC must (subject to Part VIIC of the _Crimes Act 1914_) have regard to:

     * (a) any conviction of the person, within 10 years before that time, for an offence that involves dishonesty and is punishable by imprisonment for at least 3 months; and

     * (b) whether the person has held an Australian financial services licence that was suspended or cancelled; and

     * (c) whether a banning order or disqualification order under Division 8 has previously been made against the person; and

     * (d) any other matter ASIC considers relevant.

        * Note: Part VIIC of the _Crimes Act 1914_ includes provisions that, in certain circumstances, relieve persons from the requirement to disclose spent convictions and require persons aware of such convictions to disregard them.

    * (1B) To avoid doubt, a person contravenes a financial services law if a person fails to comply with a duty imposed under that law, even if the provision imposing the duty is not an offence provision or a civil penalty provision.

    * (2) However, ASIC may only make a banning order against a person after giving the person an opportunity:

     * (a) to appear, or be represented, at a hearing before ASIC that takes place in private; and

     * (b) to make submissions to ASIC on the matter.

    * (3) Subsection (2) does not apply in so far as ASIC's grounds for making the banning order are or include the following:

     * (a) that the suspension or cancellation of the relevant licence took place under section 915B;

     * (b) that the person has been convicted of serious fraud.

##### 920B  What is a banning order?

    * (1) A **_banning order_** is a written order that prohibits a person from providing any financial services or specified financial services in specified circumstances or capacities.

    * (2) The order may prohibit the person against whom it is made from providing a financial service:

     * (a) permanently; or

     * (b) for a specified period, unless ASIC has reason to believe that the person is not of good fame or character.

    * (3) A banning order may include a provision allowing the person against whom it was made, subject to any specified conditions:

     * (a) to do specified acts; or

     * (b) to do specified acts in specified circumstances;

    * that the order would otherwise prohibit them from doing.

##### 920C  Effect of banning orders

    * (1) A person against whom a banning order is made cannot be granted an Australian financial services licence contrary to the banning order.

    * (2) A person contravenes this subsection if:

     * (a) the person engages in conduct; and

     * (b) the conduct breaches a banning order that has been made against the person.

        * Note: A contravention of this subsection is an offence (see subsection 1311(1)).

##### 920D  Variation or cancellation of banning orders

    * (1) ASIC may vary or cancel a banning order, by giving written notice to the person against whom the order was made, if ASIC is satisfied that it is appropriate to do so because of a change in any of the circumstances based on which ASIC made the order.

    * (2) ASIC may do so:

     * (a) on its own initiative; or

     * (b) if the person against whom the order was made lodges with ASIC an application for ASIC to do so, which is accompanied by the documents, if any, required by regulations made for the purposes of this paragraph.

        * Note: For fees in respect of lodging applications, see Part 9.10.

    * (3) If ASIC proposes not to vary or cancel a banning order in accordance with an application lodged by a person under paragraph (2)(b), ASIC must give the person an opportunity:

     * (a) to appear, or be represented, at a hearing before ASIC that takes place in private; and

     * (b) to make submissions to ASIC on the matter.

##### 920E  Date of effect and publication of banning order, variation or cancellation

    * (1) A banning order, or variation or cancellation of a banning order, takes effect when it is given to the person against whom the order is or was made.

    * (2) ASIC must publish a notice in the _Gazette_ as soon as practicable after making, varying or cancelling a banning order. The notice must state when the action took effect and:

     * (a) in the case of the making of a banning order--set out a copy of the banning order; or

     * (b) in the case of the variation of a banning order--set out a copy of the banning order as varied.

    * (3) However, if the banning order contains a provision of the kind referred to in subsection 920B(3) and ASIC considers that the _Gazette_ notice would be unreasonably long if that provision were included, the notice may instead set out a summary of the provision's effect.

    * (4) If ASIC makes a banning order against a person who is a participant in a licensed market or a licensed CS facility, or varies a banning order against such a person, ASIC must give the operator of the market or facility written notice of the making of the order or the variation.

##### 920F  Statement of reasons

    * (1) A banning order given to a person must be accompanied by a statement of reasons for the order.

    * (2) If ASIC varies a banning order made against a person, ASIC must, on request by the person, give the person a statement of reasons for the variation.

##### 921A  Disqualification by the Court

    * (1) ASIC may apply to the Court for an order or orders under this section in relation to a person if ASIC:

     * (a) cancels an Australian financial services licence held by the person; or

     * (b) makes a banning order against the person that is to operate permanently.

    * (2) The Court may make:

     * (a) an order disqualifying the person, permanently or for a specified period, from providing any financial services, or specified financial services, in specified circumstances or capacities; or

     * (b) any other order the Court considers appropriate.

    * (3) The Court may revoke or vary an order made under subsection (2).

    * (4) A person against whom such an order is made cannot be granted an Australian financial services licence contrary to the order.

    * (5) If the Court makes or varies an order under this section in relation to a person who is a participant in a licensed market or a licensed CS facility, ASIC must give the operator of the market or facility written notice of the making of the order or the variation.

##### 922A  Registers relating to financial services

    * (1) ASIC must establish and maintain one or more registers relating to financial services.

     * (c) persons against whom a banning order or disqualification order under Division 8 is made;

#### Division 10--Restrictions on use of terminology

##### 923A  Restriction on use of certain words or expressions

    * (1) A person contravenes this subsection if:

     * (a) either:

      * (i) the person carries on a financial services business or provides a financial service (whether or not on behalf of another person); or

      * (ii) another person (the **_provider_**) provides a financial service on behalf of the first person; and

     * (b) the first person assumes or uses, in this jurisdiction, a restricted word or expression in relation to that business or service.

        * Note 1: For the meanings of **_restricted word or expression_** and **_assume or use_**, see subsection (5).

        * Note 2: A contravention of this subsection is an offence (see subsection 1311(1)).

      * (i) commissions (apart from commissions that are rebated in full to the person's clients);

      * (ii) forms of remuneration calculated on the basis of the volume of business placed by the person with an issuer of a financial product;

      * (iii) any other person identified (whether by reference to a class of person or otherwise) in regulations made for the purposes of this subparagraph; and

     * (c) if subparagraph (1)(a)(ii) applies in relation to a financial service--the provider mentioned in that subparagraph does not receive any of the things mentioned in paragraph (a) of this subsection in respect of the provision of that service; and

     * (d) in carrying on a financial services business, or providing financial services, the person operates free from direct or indirect restrictions relating to the financial products in respect of which they provide financial services; and

     * (e) in carrying on that business, or providing those services, the person operates without any conflicts of interest that might:

      * (i) arise from their associations or relationships with issuers of financial products; and

      * (ii) reasonably be expected to influence the person in carrying on the business or providing the services.

        * Note: A defendant bears an evidential burden in relation to the matters in subsection (2). See subsection 13.3(3) of the _Criminal Code_.

    * (3) The reference in paragraph (2)(d) to direct or indirect restrictions does not include a reference to restrictions imposed on a person by:

     * (a) the conditions on an Australian financial services licence; or

     * (b) this Chapter or regulations made for the purposes of this Chapter.

    * (4) If a person assumes or uses a word or expression in circumstances that give rise to the person committing an offence based on subsection (1) of this section, the person is guilty of such an offence in respect of:

     * (a) the first day on which the offence is committed; and

     * (b) each subsequent day (if any) on which the circumstances that gave rise to the person committing the offence continue (including the day of conviction for any such offence or any later day).

    * (5) In this section:

     * (a) a reference to a restricted word or expression is a reference to:

      * (i) the word **_independent_**, **_impartial _**or **_unbiased_**; or

      * (iii) any other word or expression (whether or not in English) that is of like import to a word or expression covered by any of the previous subparagraphs; and

     * (b) a reference to a word or expression being assumed or used includes a reference to the word or expression being assumed or used:

      * (i) as part of another word or expression; or

      * (ii) in combination with other words, letters or other symbols.

##### 923B  Restriction on use of certain words or expressions unless authorised in licence conditions

    * (1) A person contravenes this subsection if:

     * (a) the person carries on a financial services business or provides a financial service (whether or not on behalf of another person); and

     * (b) the person assumes or uses, in this jurisdiction, a restricted word or expression in relation to that business or service; and

     * (c) the person is not authorised, by the conditions on an Australian financial services licence held by the person, or by a person in relation to whom they are a representative, to assume or use that word or expression (see subsection (3)).

        * Note 1: For the meanings of **_restricted word or expression_** and **_assume or use_**, see subsection (4).

        * Note 2: A contravention of this subsection is an offence (see subsection 1311(1)).

    * (2) If a person assumes or uses a word or expression in circumstances that give rise to the person committing an offence based on subsection (1), the person is guilty of such an offence in respect of:

     * (a) the first day on which the offence is committed; and

     * (b) each subsequent day (if any) on which the circumstances that gave rise to the person committing the offence continue (including the day of conviction for any such offence or any later day).

     * (a) in the case of a word or expression covered by subparagraph (4)(a)(i)--if the person:

      * (i) can, under the licence, provide a financial service relating to securities (whether or not the person can provide other financial services under the licence as well); and

      * (ii) is a participant in a licensed market whose licence covers dealings in securities;

     * (b) in the case of a word or expression covered by subparagraph (4)(a)(ii)--if the person:

    * (4) In this section:

     * (a) a reference to a restricted word or expression is a reference to:

      * (i) the expression **_stockbroker_** or **_sharebroker_**, or any other word or expression (whether or not in English) that is of like import to that expression; or

#### Division 11--Agreements with unlicensed persons relating to the provision of financial services

##### Subdivision A--Agreements affected

##### 924A  Agreements with certain unlicensed persons

    * (1) Subdivision B applies to an agreement entered into by a person (in this section and Subdivision B called the **_nonlicensee_**) and another person (in this section and Subdivision B called the **_client_**) (not being a financial services licensee) that constitutes, or relates to, the provision of a financial service by the nonlicensee if:

     * (a) the agreement is entered into in the course of a financial services business carried on by the nonlicensee; and

     * (b) the nonlicensee does not hold an Australian financial services licence covering the provision of the financial service, and is not exempt from the requirement to hold such a licence.

        * Note: It does not matter whether the financial service is provided to the client as a wholesale client or as a retail client.

    * (2) Subdivision B applies to the agreement whether or not anyone else is a party to the agreement.

##### Subdivision B--Effect on agreements

##### 925A  Client may give notice of rescission

    * (1) Subject to this section, the client may, whether before or after completion of the agreement, give to the nonlicensee a written notice stating that the client wishes to rescind the agreement.

    * (2) The client may only give a notice under this section within a reasonable period after becoming aware of the facts entitling the client to give the notice.

    * (3) The client is not entitled to give a notice under this section if the client engages in conduct by engaging in which the client would, if the entitlement so to give a notice were a right to rescind the agreement for misrepresentation by the nonlicensee, be taken to have affirmed the agreement.

    * (4) The client is not entitled to give a notice under this section if, within a reasonable period before the agreement was entered into, the nonlicensee informed the client (whether or not in writing) that the nonlicensee did not hold an Australian financial services licence.

    * (5) If, at a time when an Australian financial services licence held by the nonlicensee was suspended, the nonlicensee informed the client that the licence was suspended, the nonlicensee is to be taken for the purposes of subsection (4) to have informed the client at that time that the nonlicensee did not hold the licence.

    * (6) None of subsections (2), (3) and (4) limits the generality of either of the others.

    * (7) Subject to this section, the client may give a notice under this section whether or not:

     * (a) the notice will result under section 925B in rescission of the agreement; or

     * (b) the Court will, if the notice so results, be empowered to make a particular order, or any order at all, under section 925D.

##### 925B  Effect of notice under section 925A

    * A notice given under section 925A rescinds the agreement unless rescission of the agreement would prejudice a right, or an estate in property, acquired by a person (other than the nonlicensee) in good faith, for valuable consideration and without notice of the facts entitling the client to give the notice.

##### 925C  Client may apply to Court for partial rescission

    * (1) If the client gives a notice under section 925A but the notice does not rescind the agreement because rescission of it would prejudice a right or estate of the kind referred to in section 925B, the client may, within a reasonable period after giving the notice, apply to the Court for an order under subsection (4) of this section.

    * (2) The Court may extend the period for making an application under subsection (1).

    * (3) If an application is made under subsection (1), the Court may make such orders expressed to have effect until the determination of the application as it would have power to make if the notice had rescinded the agreement under section 925B and the application were for orders under section 925D.

    * (4) On an application under subsection (1), the Court may make an order:

     * (a) varying the agreement in such a way as to put the client in the same position, as nearly as can be done without prejudicing such a right or estate acquired before the order is made, as if the agreement had not been entered into; and

     * (b) declaring the agreement to have had effect as so varied at and after the time when it was originally made.

    * (5) If the Court makes an order under subsection (4), the agreement is to be taken for the purposes of section 925D to have been rescinded under section 925B.

    * (6) An order under subsection (4) does not affect the application of section 925F or 925H in relation to the agreement as originally made or as varied by the order.

##### may make consequential orders

    * (1) Subject to subsection (2), on rescission of the agreement under section 925B, the Court, on the application of the client or the nonlicensee, may make such order or orders as it would have power to make if the client had duly rescinded the agreement because of misrepresentation by the nonlicensee.

    * (2) The Court is not empowered to make a particular order under subsection (1) if the order would prejudice a right, or an estate in property, acquired by a person (other than the nonlicensee) in good faith, for valuable consideration and without notice of the facts entitling the client to give the notice.

##### 925E  Agreement unenforceable against client

    * (1) This section:

     * (a) applies while both of the following are the case:

      * (i) the client is entitled to give a notice under section 925A;

      * (ii) a notice so given will result under section 925B in rescission of the agreement; and

     * (b) applies after the agreement is rescinded under section 925B;

    * but does not otherwise apply.

    * (2) The nonlicensee is not entitled, as against the client:

     * (a) to enforce the agreement, whether directly or indirectly; or

     * (b) to rely on the agreement, whether directly or indirectly and whether by way of defence or otherwise.

##### 925F  Nonlicensee not entitled to recover commission

    * (1) Without limiting the generality of section 925E, this section:

     * (a) applies while the client is entitled to give a notice under section 925A; and

     * (b) applies after the client so gives a notice, even if the notice does not result under section 925B in rescission of the agreement;

    * but does not otherwise apply.

    * (2) The nonlicensee is not entitled to recover by any means (including, for example, setoff or a claim on a _quantum meruit_) any brokerage, commission or other fee for which the client would, but for this section, have been liable to the nonlicensee under or in connection with the agreement.

##### 925G  Onus of establishing nonapplication of section 925E or 925F

    * For the purposes of determining, in a proceeding in a court, whether or not the nonlicensee is, or was at a particular time, entitled as mentioned in subsection 925E(2) or 925F(2), it is to be presumed, unless the contrary is proved, that section 925E or 925F, as the case may be, applies, or applied at that time, as the case may be.

##### 925H  Client may recover commission paid to nonlicensee

    * (1) Without limiting the generality of section 925D, if the client gives a notice under section 925A, the client may, even if the notice does not result under section 925B in rescission of the agreement, recover from the nonlicensee as a debt the amount of any brokerage, commission or other fee that the client has paid to the nonlicensee under or in connection with the agreement.

    * (2) ASIC may, if it considers that it is in the public interest to do so, bring an action under subsection (1) in the name of, and for the benefit of, the client.

##### 925I  Remedies under this Division additional to other remedies

    * The client's rights and remedies under this Division are additional to, and do not prejudice, any other right or remedy of the client.

#### Division 12--Miscellaneous

##### 926A  Exemptions and modifications by ASIC

    * (1) The **_provisions to which this section applies_** are all provisions of this Part other than Divisions 4 and 8.

    * (3) An exemption may apply unconditionally or subject to specified conditions. A person to whom a condition specified in an exemption applies must comply with the condition. The Court may order the person to comply with the condition in a specified way. Only ASIC may apply to the Court for the order.

    * (4) An exemption or declaration is a legislative instrument if the exemption or declaration is expressed to apply in relation to a class of persons or a class of financial products (whether or not it is also expressed to apply in relation to one or more persons or products identified otherwise than by reference to membership of a class).

    * (4A) If subsection (4) does not apply to an exemption or declaration, the exemption or declaration must be in writing and ASIC must publish notice of it in the _Gazette_.

    * (5) If conduct (including an omission) of a person would not have constituted an offence if a particular declaration under paragraph (2)(c) had not been made, that conduct does not constitute an offence unless, before the conduct occurred (in addition to complying with the requirements of the _Legislative Instruments Act 2003_ (if the declaration is of a kind referred to in subsection (4)), or with the gazettal requirement of subsection (4A), as the case may be):

     * (a) the text of the declaration was made available by ASIC on the internet; or

     * (b) ASIC gave written notice setting out the text of the declaration to the person.

    * In a prosecution for an offence to which this subsection applies, the prosecution must prove that paragraph (a) or (b) was complied with before the conduct occurred.

     * (a) definitions in this Act, or in the regulations, as they apply to references in those provisions; and

     * (b) any provisions of Part 10.2 (transitional provisions) that relate to those provisions.

        * Note: Because of section 761H, a reference to the provisions to which this section applies, or to provisions of Part 10.2, also includes a reference to regulations or other instruments made for the purposes of those provisions.

##### 926B  Exemptions and modifications by regulations

    * (1) The regulations may:

     * (a) exempt a person or class of persons from all or specified provisions of this Part; or

### Part 7.7--Financial services disclosure

#### Division 1--Preliminary

##### 940A  How Part applies if a financial services licensee is acting as authorised representative

    * If a financial services licensee is, in providing a financial service, acting as the authorised representative of another financial services licensee (see section 916E), this Part applies to the firstmentioned licensee, in relation to the service, in the capacity of authorised representative (rather than the capacity of licensee).

##### 940B  What if there is no reasonable opportunity to give a document, information or statement required by this Part?

    * (1) If:

     * (a) apart from this section, a person (the **_providing entity_**) would be required by a provision of this Part to give another person (the **_client_**) a particular document (for example, a Financial Services Guide or a Statement of Advice), or particular information or a particular statement; and

     * (b) the providing entity has not had a reasonable opportunity to give (in accordance with section 940C) the client the document, information or statement by the time they are required by this Part to give it to the client;

    * the fact that the providing entity has not given the document, information or statement to the client as required by the provision is not a contravention of the provision.

        * Note: In a prosecution for an offence, a defendant bears an evidential burden in relation to the matters in this section (see subsection 13.3(3) of the _Criminal Code_).

    * (2) For the purposes of subsection (1), the providing entity is not taken not to have had a reasonable opportunity to provide the document, information or statement if:

    * (4) For the purposes of this Part (unless a contrary intention appears), a statement that subsection 941D(2) or 946C(2) requires to be given by a person (the **_providing entity_**) to another person (the **_client_**) is given by the providing entity to the client if (and only if) it is given orally to the client or the client's agent.

        * Note: If the providing entity is the authorised representative of 2 or more financial services licensees, each of those licensees is, for the purposes of this Division, an authorising licensee in relation to the financial service provided to the client, even though the providing entity may not have been acting as representative of each of those licensees in providing the service to the client.

    * (2) A Financial Services Guide must not be given to the person by the providing entity unless the authorising licensee, or each of the authorising licensees, has authorised its distribution by the providing entity.

##### 941C  Situations in which a Financial Services Guide is not required

    * Client has already received the information

     * (a) the providing entity is an issuer of financial products; and

     * (b) the financial service is a dealing (see section 766C) in financial products, other than derivatives able to be traded on a licensed market, issued by the providing entity, and does not also relate to financial products issued by someone else.

        * Note: The issuer will however have to comply with the Product Disclosure Statement requirements (see Division 2 of Part 7.9).

    * (5) However, if subsection (4) applies and the client is not given a Financial Services Guide before the advice is provided, the client must instead, before the advice is provided, be given the information that would be required to be in the Financial Services Guide by paragraphs 942B(2)(a), (e) and (f), or paragraphs 942C(2)(a), (c), (f) and (g), as the case requires.

    * Time critical cases

    * (2) If:

     * (a) the client expressly instructs that they require the financial service to be provided immediately, or by a specified time; and

     * (b) it is not reasonably practicable to give the Financial Services Guide to the client before the service is provided as so instructed;

    * the providing entity must instead give the client a statement that complies with subsection (3) before the service is provided.

    * the providing entity must, before the service is provided, give the client:

     * (c) another Financial Services Guide that contains the up to date information before the service is provided; or

#### Division 7--Enforcement

##### Subdivision A--Offences

##### 952A  Overview

    * This Subdivision contains provisions creating offences by references to various rules contained in preceding Divisions of this Part. However, it does not create all the offences relating to those rules, as some offences are created by subsection 1311(1). Where offences are created by subsection 1311(1) in relation to a rule, this is indicated by a note at the end of the provision containing the rule.

##### 952B  Definitions

    * (1) In this Subdivision:

    * **_defective_**, in relation to a disclosure document or statement, means:

     * (a) if the disclosure document or statement is a Financial Services Guide, a Supplementary Financial Services Guide, or is information or a statement required by subsection 941C(5), 941C(7) or 941D(2):

      * (i) there is a misleading or deceptive statement in the disclosure document or statement; or

      * (ii) if it is a Financial Services Guide--there is an omission from the Financial Services Guide of material required by section 942B or 942C; or

      * (iii) if it is a Supplementary Financial Services Guide that is given for the purposes of paragraph 941F(d)--there is an omission from the Supplementary Financial Services Guide of material required by that paragraph; or

      * (iv) if it is information or a statement required by subsection 941C(5), 941C(7) or 941D(2)--there is an omission from the document or statement of material required by that subsection;

     * being a statement, or an omission, that is or would be materially adverse from the point of view of a reasonable person considering whether to proceed to be provided with the financial service concerned; or

     * (b) if the disclosure document or statement is a Statement of Advice, or is information, a statement or a copy of a record required by subsection 946AA(5), 946B(3), (6) or (8) or 946C(2):

      * (i) there is a misleading or deceptive statement in the disclosure document or statement; or

      * (ii) if it is a Statement of Advice--there is an omission from the Statement of advice of material required by section 947B, 947C or 947D; or

      * (iii) if it is information, a statement or a copy of a record required by subsection 946AA(5), 946B(3), (6) or (8) or 946C(2)--there is an omission from the information, statement or copy of material required by that subsection or section;

     * being a statement, or an omission, that is or would be materially adverse from the point of view of a reasonable person considering whether to act in reliance on the advice concerned.

        * Note: In determining whether a Financial Services Guide is defective, the effect of section 943D must be taken into account (section 943D takes information and statements in a Supplementary Financial Services Guide to be included in the Financial Services Guide it supplements).

    * **_disclosure document or statement_** means:

     * (a) a Financial Services Guide; or

     * (b) a Supplementary Financial Services Guide; or

     * (c) a Statement of Advice; or

     * (d) information, a statement or a copy of a record required by subsection 941C(5) or (7), 941D(2), 946AA(5), 946B(3), (6) or (8) or 946C(2).

    * (1A) For the avoidance of doubt, if section 941E (information must be up to date) is not complied with in relation to a Financial Services Guide, then, for the purposes of the definition of **_defective _**in subsection (1):

     * (a) if the circumstance constituting the noncompliance is that particular information included in the Financial Services Guide is not as up to date as section 941E requires it to be--the information so included constitutes a misleading statement in the Financial Services Guide; and

     * (b) if the circumstance constituting the noncompliance is a failure to include particular information that was not previously required to be included in the Financial Services Guide--the failure to include the information constitutes an omission from the Statement of material required by section 942B or 942C.

        * Note 1: The effect of section 943D (information in a Supplementary Financial Services Guide is taken to be contained in the Financial Services Guide it supplements) must be taken into account in determining whether section 941E is complied with in relation to a Financial Services Guide.

        * Note 2: Whether the inclusion of out of date information, or the failure to include information, results in the Financial Services Guide being **_defective_** as defined in subsection (1) depends on whether the materiality test set out in that definition is satisfied.

    * (2) In this Subdivision, a reference (including in the definitions in subsection (1)) to a document or statement of a kind referred to in a paragraph of the definition of **_disclosure document or statement _**in subsection (1) includes a reference to something purporting to be a document or statement of that kind.

      * (iii) if it is information, a statement or a copy of a record required by subsection 946AA(5), 946B(3), (6) or (8) or 946C(2)--there is an omission from the information, statement or copy of material required by that subsection or section.

        * Note: In determining whether a Financial Services Guide is defective, the effect of section 943D must be taken into account (section 943D takes information and statements in a Supplementary Financial Services Guide to be included in the Financial Services Guide it supplements).

    * **_disclosure document or statement_** means:

     * (a) a Financial Services Guide; or

     * (b) a Supplementary Financial Services Guide; or

     * (c) a Statement of Advice; or

    * (1A) For the avoidance of doubt, if section 941E (information must be up to date) is not complied with in relation to a Financial Services Guide, then, for the purposes of the definition of **_defective _**in subsection (1):

     * (a) if the circumstance constituting the noncompliance is that particular information included in the Financial Services Guide is not as up to date as section 941E requires it to be--the information so included constitutes a misleading statement in the Financial Services Guide; and

     * (b) if the circumstance constituting the noncompliance is a failure to include particular information that was not previously required to be included in the Financial Services Guide--the failure to include the information constitutes an omission from the Statement of material required by section 942B or 942C.

        * Note: The effect of section 943D (information in a Supplementary Financial Services Guide is taken to be contained in the Financial Services Guide it supplements) must be taken into account in determining whether section 941E is complied with in relation to a Financial Services Guide.

    * (2) In this Subdivision, a reference (including in the definitions in subsection (1)) to a document or statement of a kind referred to in a paragraph of the definition of **_disclosure document or statement _**in subsection (1) includes a reference to something purporting to be a document or statement of that kind.

    * (2) In a situation to which this section applies, if a person suffers loss or damage:

     * (a) if paragraph (1)(a) applies--because the client was not given the disclosure document or statement that they should have been given; or

     * (b) if paragraph (1)(b) applies--because the disclosure document or statement the client was given was defective; or

     * (c) if paragraph (1)(c) applies--because of the contravention referred to in that paragraph;

    * the person may, subject to subsection (6), recover the amount of the loss or damage by action against the, or a, liable person (see subsections (3) and (4)), whether or not that person (or anyone else) has been convicted of an offence in respect of the matter referred to in paragraph (a), (b) or (c).

    * (3) For the purposes of subsection (2), the, or a, **_liable person _**is:

      * (ii) if, under the rules in section 917C, 2 or more of those licensees are jointly and severally responsible for the person's conduct--each of those licensees.

    * (3A) For the purposes of paragraph (3)(c):

     * (a) section 917C is taken to apply, despite section 917F; and

     * (b) section 917D is taken not to apply.

    * (4) If:

     * (a) paragraph (1)(b) applies; and

     * (b) an alteration was made to the disclosure document or statement before it was given to the client; and

     * (c) the alteration made the disclosure document or statement defective, or more defective than it would otherwise have been; and

     * (d) the alteration was not made by, or with the authority of, the person who would, but for this subsection, be the liable person because of paragraph (3)(a);

    * then, so far as a person has suffered loss or damage because the disclosure document or statement was defective because of the alteration, the liable person is the person who made the alteration, rather than the person referred to in paragraph (d).

    * (5) An action under subsection (2) may be begun at any time within 6 years after the day on which the cause of action arose.

    * (6) A person is not liable under subsection (2) in a situation described in paragraph (1)(b) if the person took reasonable steps to ensure that the disclosure document or statement would not be defective.

    * (7) This section does not affect any liability that a person has under any other law.

##### 953C  Additional powers of court to make orders

##### Subdivision B--Provider must act in the best interests of the client

##### 961B  Provider must act in the best interests of the client

     * (a) identified the objectives, financial situation and needs of the client that were disclosed to the provider by the client through instructions;

     * (b) identified:

      * (i) the subject matter of the advice that has been sought by the client (whether explicitly or implicitly); and

      * (ii) the objectives, financial situation and needs of the client that would reasonably be considered as relevant to advice sought on that subject matter (the**_ client's relevant circumstances_**);

     * (c) where it was reasonably apparent that information relating to the client's relevant circumstances was incomplete or inaccurate, made reasonable inquiries to obtain complete and accurate information;

     * (d) assessed whether the provider has the expertise required to provide the client advice on the subject matter sought and, if not, declined to provide the advice;

     * (e) if, in considering the subject matter of the advice sought, it would be reasonable to consider recommending a financial product:

      * (i) conducted a reasonable investigation into the financial products that might achieve those of the objectives and meet those of the needs of the client that would reasonably be considered as relevant to advice on that subject matter; and

      * (ii) assessed the information gathered in the investigation;

        * _Note:	The matters that must be proved under subsection (2) relate to the subject matter of the advice sought by the client and the circumstances of the client relevant to that subject matter (the client's relevant circumstances). That subject matter and the client's relevant circumstances may be broad or narrow, and so the subsection anticipates that a client may seek scaled advice and that the inquiries made by the provider will be tailored to the advice sought.

    * Basic banking products--best interests duty satisfied if certain steps are taken

    * (3) If:

     * (a) the subject matter of the advice sought by the client is solely a basic banking product; and

##### 961D  What is a reasonable investigation?

    * (1) A **_reasonable investigation_** into the financial products that might achieve those of the objectives and meet those of the needs of the client that would reasonably be considered relevant to advice on the subject matter sought by the client does not require an investigation into every financial product available.

    * (2) However, if the client requests the provider to consider a specified financial product, a reasonable investigation into the financial products that might achieve those of the objectives and meet those of the needs of the client that would reasonably be considered relevant to advice on the subject matter sought by the client includes an investigation into that financial product.

     * (d) sections 1012E and 1012F are to be disregarded;

    * Modification of section 1013A

    * (5) Section 1013A applies in relation to a regulated acquisition as if:

     * (a) paragraph 1013A(1)(b) also covered a Product Disclosure Statement that is required to be given by subsection (2) of this section in relation to an acquisition covered by paragraph (a) of the definition of **_regulated acquisition_** in subsection (1) of this section; and

      * (i) applications for a minimum number of financial products of that kind are received; or

      * (ii) a minimum amount is raised;

     * and that condition is not satisfied within 4 months after the relevant date (see subsections (3) and (4)); or

     * (b) a Product Disclosure Statement for a financial product states or implies that a financial product to which the Statement relates will be able to be traded on a financial market (whether in Australia or elsewhere) and:

      * (i) an application has not, within 7 days after the relevant date (see subsection (4)), been made to the operator of that market for the taking of such action as is necessary to enable financial products of that kind to be traded on that market; or

      * (ii) at the end of the period of 3 months starting on the relevant date, financial products of that kind are not able to be traded on that market; or

     * (c) in relation to a Product Disclosure Statement for a financial product, the responsible person becomes aware that the Product Disclosure Statement was defective as at the time when it was prepared, or that it became or has become defective as at some later time.

        * Note: Information and statements in a Supplementary Product Disclosure Statement are taken to be contained in the Product Disclosure Statement it supplements (see section 1014D).

    * (2) If this section applies, the responsible person must, in relation to any application for financial products of the relevant kind that is made in response to the Product Disclosure Statement (the **_first Product Disclosure Statement_**) and that has not resulted in an issue or sale of financial products of that kind, comply with one of the following paragraphs:

     * (a) the responsible person must repay the money they received from the applicant; or

     * (aa) the responsible person must give the applicant:

      * (i) a new Product Disclosure Statement for the financial products, and an additional statement that identifies the respects in which the new Product Disclosure Statement is materially different from the first Product Disclosure Statement; and

      * (ii) 1 month to withdraw their application and be repaid; or

     * (b) the responsible person must give the applicant:

      * (i) a Supplementary Product Disclosure Statement that changes the statement referred to in paragraph (1)(a) or (b), or that corrects the deficiency referred to in paragraph (1)(c); and

      * (ii) 1 month to withdraw their applications and be repaid; or

     * (ba) the responsible person must issue or sell the financial products to the applicant and give them:

      * (i) a new Product Disclosure Statement for the financial products, and an additional statement that identifies the respects in which the new Product Disclosure Statement is materially different from the first Product Disclosure Statement; and

      * (ii) 1 month to return the financial products and be repaid; or

     * (c) the responsible person must issue or sell the financial products to the applicant and give them:

      * (i) a Supplementary Product Disclosure Statement that changes the statement referred to in paragraph (1)(a) or (b), or that corrects the deficiency referred to in paragraph (1)(c); and

      * (ii) 1 month to return the financial products and be repaid.

        * Note 1: Failure to comply with this subsection is an offence (see subsection 1311(1)).

        * Note 2: If the responsible person chooses the option given by paragraph (aa) or (b), that option does not require the responsible person to wait until the end of the month referred to in subparagraph (aa)(ii) or (b)(ii) before going ahead and issuing or selling the financial products to the applicant if the applicant indicates before then that they still wish to proceed with the application.

        * Note 3: However, if the responsible person chooses the option given by paragraph (aa) or (b), whether the responsible person may go ahead and issue or sell the financial products to the applicant at the end of the month referred to in subparagraph (aa)(ii) or (b)(ii) (or earlier, as mentioned in note 2) is affected by this subsection and sections 1016A to 1016E (including as those provisions are affected by subsections (2A) and (2B) of this section).

        * Note 4: If the responsible person chooses the option given by paragraph (c), sections 1016A to 1016D do not prohibit the issue or sale of the financial products under that paragraph (see subsection (2C) of this section).

    * (2A) If, in accordance with paragraph (2)(aa), the responsible person gives the applicant a new Product Disclosure Statement for the financial products and the additional statement referred to in subparagraph (2)(aa)(i):

     * (a) subsection (2), and sections 1016B, 1016C, 1016D and 1016E, apply in relation to the application, from the time when the applicant is given the new Product Disclosure Statement (the **_correction time_**), as if the application had been made in response to the new Product Disclosure Statement; and

     * (b) if:

      * (i) the reason for giving the new Product Disclosure Statement was that the responsible person became aware that the first Product Disclosure Statement was defective as at the time when it was prepared, or had become defective by the time the application was made; and

      * (ii) the financial products are **_relevant financial products _**as defined in section 1016A;

     * section 1016A applies in relation to the application, from the correction time, as if the first Product Disclosure Statement had instead contained the content of the new Product Disclosure Statement.

        * Note 1: Because of paragraph (a):

          * (a) if this section applies to the new Product Disclosure Statement, the responsible person's ability to proceed to issue or sell the financial products pursuant to the application will be affected by subsection (2), and by sections 1016B, 1016C and 1016D, as those provisions apply in relation to the new Product Disclosure Statement (even though the application was actually made in response to the first Product Disclosure Statement); and

          * (b) sections 1016B, 1016C and 1016D, as they relate to the first Product Disclosure Statement, cease to apply in relation to the application.

        * Note 2: Because of paragraph (b), the application may be an **_eligible application_** as defined in section 1016A, even though the first Product Disclosure Statement was actually defective as at the time when the application was made.

    * (2B) If:

     * (a) in accordance with paragraph (2)(b), the responsible person gives the applicant a Supplementary Product Disclosure Statement that relates to the financial products; and

     * (b) the reason for giving the Supplementary Product Disclosure Statement was that the responsible person became aware that the first Product Disclosure Statement was defective as at the time when it was prepared, or had become defective by the time the application was made; and

     * (c) the financial products are **_relevant financial products _**as defined in section 1016A;

    * section 1016A applies in relation to the application, from the time when the applicant is given the Supplementary Product Disclosure Statement, as if the Supplementary Product Disclosure Statement had been given to the applicant before the application was made.

        * Note 1: Because of this subsection and section 1014D (information in a Supplementary Product Disclosure Statement is taken to be contained in the Product Disclosure Statement it supplements), the application may be an **_eligible application_** as defined in section 1016A, even though the Supplementary Product Disclosure Statement was not actually given until after the time when the application was made.

        * Note 2: The responsible person's ability to proceed to issue or sell the financial products pursuant to the application will be affected by subsection (2), and by sections 1016B, 1016C and 1016D, as those provisions apply in relation to the first Product Disclosure Statement as affected by the Supplementary Product Disclosure Statement and any other Supplementary Product Disclosure Statements.

    * (2BA) If Subdivision DA applies:

     * (a) for the purposes of subsection (2), instead of giving the applicant a Supplementary Product Disclosure Statement, the responsible person may give the applicant a Replacement Product Disclosure Statement; and

     * (b) if the responsible person gives the applicant a Replacement Product Disclosure Statement, subsection (2B) applies as if references in that subsection to a Supplementary Product Disclosure Statement were references to the Replacement Product Disclosure Statement.

    * (2C) If the responsible person chooses to comply with paragraph (2)(c), nothing in sections 1016A to 1016D applies to the issue or sale of the financial products under that paragraph.

        * Note: This subsection affects the elements of the offences under sections 1016A to 1016D, and so it is not an exception in relation to which a defendant bears an evidential burden under subsection 13.3(3) of the _Criminal Code_.

    * (3) For the purpose of working out whether the condition referred to in paragraph (1)(a) has been satisfied, a person who has agreed to take a financial product as an underwriter is taken to have applied for that financial product.

    * (4) For the purposes of paragraphs (1)(a) and (b), the **_relevant date _**in relation to an express or implied statement is:

     * (a) if the statement is express or implied in a Product Disclosure Statement, disregarding the effect of section 1014D--the date of the Product Disclosure Statement; or

     * (b) if the statement is express or implied in a Supplementary Product Disclosure Statement--the date of the Supplementary Product Disclosure Statement; or

     * (c) if the statement is express or implied in a Replacement Product Disclosure Statement (whether or not it is express or implied in the earlier Product Disclosure Statement it replaces)--the date of the Replacement Product Disclosure Statement.

    * (5) For the purposes of this section, **_defective_**, when used in relation to a Product Disclosure Statement at a particular time, means that the Product Disclosure Statement, if it had been given to a person at that time, would have been **_defective_** as defined in Subdivision A of Division 7.

        * Note: Information in a Supplementary Product Disclosure Statement is taken to be contained in the Product Disclosure Statement it supplements (see section 1014D).

##### 1016F  Remedies for person acquiring financial product under defective Product Disclosure Document

    * (1) Subject to this section, if a financial product is issued or sold to a person (the **_client_**) in contravention of section 1016E, the client has the right to return the product and to have the money they paid to acquire the product repaid. This is so even if the responsible person is being wound up.

    * (2) If the responsible person:

    * (5) On the exercise of the right to return the product:

     * (b) any contract for the acquisition of the product by the client is, by force of this section, terminated with effect from that time without penalty to the client.

    * (6) The regulations may provide for consequences and obligations (in addition to those provided for by subsection (5)) to apply if the right to return a financial product is exercised.

    * (7) The regulations may do any or all of the following:

#### Division 7--Enforcement

##### Subdivision A--Offences

##### 1021A  Overview

    * This Subdivision contains provisions creating offences by reference to various rules contained in preceding Divisions of this Part. However, it does not create all the offences relating to those rules, as some offences are created by subsection 1311(1). Where offences are created by subsection 1311(1) in relation to a rule, this is indicated by a note at the end of the provision containing the rule.

##### 1021B  Definitions

    * (1) In this Subdivision:

    * **_defective_**, in relation to a disclosure document or statement, means:

     * (a) there is a misleading or deceptive statement in the disclosure document or statement; or

     * (b) if it is a Product Disclosure Statement--there is an omission from the Product Disclosure Statement of material required by section 1013C, other than material required by section 1013B or 1013G; or

     * (c) if it is a Supplementary Product Disclosure Statement that is given for the purposes of section 1014E--there is an omission from the Supplementary Product Disclosure Statement of material required by that section; or

     * (d) if it is information required by paragraph 1012G(3)(a)--there is an omission from the information of material required by that paragraph;

    * being a statement, or an omission, that is or would be materially adverse from the point of view of a reasonable person considering whether to proceed to acquire the financial product concerned.

        * Note: In determining whether a Product Disclosure Statement is defective, the effect of section 1014D must be taken into account (section 1014D takes information and statements in a Supplementary Product Disclosure Statement to be included in the Product Disclosure Statement it supplements).

    * **_disclosure document or statement_** means:

     * (a) a Product Disclosure Statement; or

     * (b) a Supplementary Product Disclosure Statement; or

     * (c) information required by paragraph 1012G(3)(a).

    * **_regulated person _**has the same meaning as it has in Division 2.

    * (1A) For the avoidance of doubt, if section 1012J (information must be up to date) is not complied with in relation to a Product Disclosure Statement, then, for the purposes of the definition of **_defective _**in subsection (1):

     * (a) if the circumstance constituting the noncompliance is that particular information included in the Product Disclosure Statement is not as up to date as section 1012J requires it to be--the information so included constitutes a misleading statement in the Product Disclosure Statement; and

     * (b) if the circumstance constituting the noncompliance is a failure to include particular information that was not previously required to be included in the Product Disclosure Statement--the failure to include the information constitutes an omission from the Statement of material required by section 1013C.

        * Note 1: The effect of section 1014D (information in a Supplementary Product Disclosure Statement is taken to be contained in the Product Disclosure Statement it supplements) must be taken into account in determining whether section 1012J is complied with in relation to a Product Disclosure Statement.

        * Note 2: Whether the inclusion of out of date information, or the failure to include information, results in the Product Disclosure Statement being **_defective_** as defined in subsection (1) depends on whether the materiality test set out in that definition is satisfied.

    * (2) In this Subdivision, a reference (including in the definitions in subsection (1)) to a document or statement, or to information, of a kind referred to in a paragraph of the definition of **_disclosure document or statement _**in subsection (1) includes a reference to something purporting to be a document or statement, or to be information, of that kind.

##### Subdivision B--Civil liability

##### 1022A  Definitions

    * (1) In this Subdivision:

    * **_defective_**, in relation to a disclosure document or statement, means:

     * (a) there is a misleading or deceptive statement in the disclosure document or statement; or

     * (b) if it is a Product Disclosure Statement--there is an omission from the Product Disclosure Statement of material required by section 1013C, other than material required by section 1013B or 1013G; or

     * (c) if it is a Supplementary Product Disclosure Statement that is given for the purposes of section 1014E--there is an omission from the Supplementary Product Disclosure Statement of material required by that section; or

     * (d) if it is information required by paragraph 1012G(3)(a)--there is an omission from the information of material required by that paragraph; or

     * (e) if it is an offer document of a kind referred to in section 1019E--there is an omission from the document of material required by section 1019I; or

     * (f) if it is a supplementary offer document of a kind referred to in section 1019J--there is an omission from the document of material required by subsection 1019J(3).

        * Note: In determining whether a Product Disclosure Statement is defective, the effect of section 1014D must be taken into account (section 1014D takes information and statements in a Supplementary Product Disclosure Statement to be included in the Product Disclosure Statement it supplements).

    * **_disclosure document or statement_** means:

     * (a) a Product Disclosure Statement; or

     * (b) a Supplementary Product Disclosure Statement; or

     * (c) information required by paragraph 1012G(3)(a); or

     * (d) an offer document of a kind referred to in section 1019E; or

     * (e) a supplementary offer document of a kind referred to in section 1019J.

    * **_regulated person _**has the same meaning as it has in Division 2.

    * (1A) For the avoidance of doubt, if section 1012J (information must be up to date) is not complied with in relation to a Product Disclosure Statement, then, for the purposes of the definition of **_defective _**in subsection (1):

     * (a) if the circumstance constituting the noncompliance is that particular information included in the Product Disclosure Statement is not as up to date as section 1012J requires it to be--the information so included constitutes a misleading statement in the Product Disclosure Statement; and

     * (b) if the circumstance constituting the noncompliance is a failure to include particular information that was not previously required to be included in the Product Disclosure Statement--the failure to include the information constitutes an omission from the Statement of material required by section 1013C.

        * Note: The effect of section 1014D (information in a Supplementary Product Disclosure Statement is taken to be contained in the Product Disclosure Statement it supplements) must be taken into account in determining whether section 1012J is complied with in relation to a Product Disclosure Statement.

    * (2) In this Subdivision, a reference (including in the definitions in subsection (1)) to a document or statement, or to information, of a kind referred to in a paragraph of the definition of **_disclosure document or statement _**in subsection (1) includes a reference to something purporting to be a document or statement, or to be information, of that kind.

     * (a) if paragraph (1)(a) applies--because the client was not given the disclosure document or statement that they should have been given; or

     * (aa) if paragraph (1)(aa) applies--because the client was not sent an offer document in accordance with section 1019E; or

     * (ab) if paragraph (1)(ab) applies--because the client received an invitation prohibited by section 1019F rather than being sent an offer document in accordance with section 1019E; or

     * (ac) if paragraph (1)(ac) applies--because the client was not sent a withdrawal document or a supplementary offer document as required by subsection 1019J(2); or

     * (a) economic loss; or

     * (b) damage to property;

    * caused by conduct that was done in a contravention of section 1041H.

    * (2) For the purposes of this Division, there is a single apportionable claim in proceedings in respect of the same loss or damage even if the claim for the loss or damage is based on more than one cause of action (whether or not of the same or a different kind).

    * (3) In this Division, a **_concurrent wrongdoer_**, in relation to a claim, is a person who is one of 2 or more persons whose acts or omissions (or act or omission) caused, independently of each other or jointly, the damage or loss that is the subject of the claim.

    * (4) For the purposes of this Division, apportionable claims are limited to those claims specified in subsection (1).

    * (1) Nothing in this Division operates to exclude the liability of a concurrent wrongdoer (an **_excluded concurrent wrongdoer_**) in proceedings involving an apportionable claim if:

     * (a) the concurrent wrongdoer intended to cause the economic loss or damage to property that is the subject of the claim; or

     * (b) the concurrent wrongdoer fraudulently caused the economic loss or damage to property that is the subject of the claim.

    * (2) The liability of an excluded concurrent wrongdoer is to be determined in accordance with the legal rules (if any) that (apart from this Division) are relevant.

    * (3) The liability of any other concurrent wrongdoer who is not an excluded concurrent wrongdoer is to be determined in accordance with the provisions of this Division.

##### 1041N  Proportionate liability for apportionable claims

    * (1) In any proceedings involving an apportionable claim:

     * (a) the liability of a defendant who is a concurrent wrongdoer in relation to that claim is limited to an amount reflecting that proportion of the damage or loss claimed that the court considers just having regard to the extent of the defendant's responsibility for the damage or loss; and

     * (b) the court may give judgment against the defendant for not more than that amount.

    * (2) If the proceedings involve both an apportionable claim and a claim that is not an apportionable claim:

     * (a) liability for the apportionable claim is to be determined in accordance with the provisions of this Division; and

     * (b) liability for the other claim is to be determined in accordance with the legal rules, if any, that (apart from this Division) are relevant.

    * (3) In apportioning responsibility between defendants in the proceedings:

     * (a) the court is to exclude that proportion of the damage or loss in relation to which the plaintiff is contributorily negligent under any relevant law; and

     * (b) the court may have regard to the comparative responsibility of any concurrent wrongdoer who is not a party to the proceedings.

    * (4) This section applies in proceedings involving an apportionable claim whether or not all concurrent wrongdoers are parties to the proceedings.

    * (5) A reference in this Division to a defendant in proceedings includes any person joined as a defendant or other party in the proceedings (except as a plaintiff) whether joined under this Division, under rules of court or otherwise.

##### 1041O  Defendant to notify plaintiff of concurrent wrongdoer of whom defendant aware

    * (1) If:

     * (a) a defendant in proceedings involving an apportionable claim has reasonable grounds to believe that a particular person (the **_other person_****) **may be a concurrent wrongdoer in relation to the claim; and

     * (b) the defendant fails to give the plaintiff, as soon as practicable, written notice of the information that the defendant has about:

      * (i) the identity of the other person; and

      * (ii) the circumstances that may make the other person a concurrent wrongdoer in relation to the claim; and

     * (c) the plaintiff unnecessarily incurs costs in the proceedings because the plaintiff was not aware that the other person may be a concurrent wrongdoer in relation to the claim;

    * the court hearing the proceedings may order that the defendant pay all or any of those costs of the plaintiff.

    * (2) The court may order that the costs to be paid by the defendant be assessed on an indemnity basis or otherwise.

##### 1041P  Contribution not recoverable from defendant

    * A defendant against whom judgment is given under this Division as a concurrent wrongdoer in relation to an apportionable claim: 

     * (a) cannot be required to contribute to any damages or contribution recovered from another concurrent wrongdoer in respect of the apportionable claim (whether or not the damages or contribution are recovered in the same proceedings in which judgment is given against the defendant); and

     * (b) cannot be required to indemnify any such wrongdoer.

##### 1041Q  Subsequent actions

    * (1) In relation to an apportionable claim, nothing in this Division or any other law prevents a plaintiff who has previously recovered judgment against a concurrent wrongdoer for an apportionable part of any damage or loss from bringing another action against any other concurrent wrongdoer for that damage or loss.

    * (2) However, in any proceedings in respect of any such action, the plaintiff cannot recover an amount of damages that, having regard to any damages previously recovered by the plaintiff in respect of the damage or loss, would result in the plaintiff receiving compensation for damage or loss that is greater than the damage or loss actually sustained by the plaintiff.

##### 1041R  Joining nonparty concurrent wrongdoer in the action

    * (1) The court may give leave for any one or more persons to be joined as defendants in proceedings involving an apportionable claim.

    * (2) The court is not to give leave for the joinder of any person who was a party to any previously concluded proceedings in respect of the apportionable claim.

##### 1041S  Application of Division

    * Nothing in this Division: 

     * (a) prevents a person being held vicariously liable for a proportion of an apportionable claim for which another person is liable; or

     * (b) prevents a partner from being held severally liable with another partner for that proportion of an apportionable claim for which the other partner is liable; or

     * (c) affects the operation of any other Act to the extent that it imposes several liability on any person in respect of what would otherwise be an apportionable claim.

    * (5) The application must be accompanied by:

#### Division 2--Transfer of certain securities

##### Subdivision A--General provisions

##### 1071A  Application of the Subdivision to certain securities

    * (1) This Subdivision applies to the following securities:

     * (a) shares in a company;

     * (b) debentures of a company;

     * (c) interests in a registered scheme.

    * (2) This Subdivision applies to an interest in a registered scheme as if:

     * (a) references to a company were instead references to the responsible entity of the registered scheme; and

     * (b) references to the constitution of a company were instead references to the constitution of the registered scheme; and

     * (c) references to members of a company were instead references to members of the registered scheme.

##### 1071B  Instrument of transfer

    * (1) This section does not apply to a transfer of a security through a prescribed CS facility.

    * (2) Subject to subsection (5), a company must only register a transfer of securities if a proper instrument of transfer (see subsections (3) and (4)) has been delivered to the company. This is so despite:

     * (a) anything in its constitution; or

     * (b) anything in a deed relating to debentures.

        * Note: Failure to comply with this subsection is an offence (see subsection 1311(1)).

    * (3) An instrument of transfer is not a proper instrument of transfer for the purposes of subsection (2) if it does not show the details, specified in the regulations, in relation to the company concerned.

    * (4) If the transfer of the securities is covered by Division 3 of this Part, then (in addition to subsection (3)), the instrument is not a proper instrument of transfer for the purposes of subsection (2) unless it is a sufficient transfer of the securities under regulations made for the purposes of that Division.

    * (5) Subsection (2) does not prejudice the power of the company to register, as the holder of securities, a person to whom the right to the securities has devolved by will or by operation of law.

    * (6) Subsections (7) to (13) deal with a transfer of a security of a dead holder by the dead holder's personal representative. They deal with the transfer differently depending on whether the personal representative is a local representative or not.

    * (7) The personal representative is a **_local representative_** if the representative is duly constituted as a personal representative under the law of the State or Territory in which the security is situated.

        * Note: Subsection 1070A(4) provides that the security is situated where the relevant register is kept.

    * (8) If the personal representative is a local representative, a transfer of the security by the representative is as valid as if the representative had been registered as the holder of the security at the time when the instrument of transfer was executed.

    * (9) If:

     * (a) the personal representative is not a local representative; and

     * (b) the representative:

      * (i) executes an instrument of transfer of the security to the representative or to another person; and

      * (ii) delivers the instrument to the company; and

      * (iii) delivers to the company with the instrument a statement in writing made by the representative to the effect that, to the best of the representative's knowledge, information and belief, no grant of representation of the estate of the deceased holder has been applied for or made in the State or Territory in which the security is located and no application for such a grant will be made; and

     * (c) the statement is made within 3 months immediately before the date on which the statement is delivered to the company;

    * the company must (subject to subsection (10)) register the transfer and pay to the representative any dividends or other money accrued in respect of the security up to the time when the instrument was executed.

    * (10) Subsection (9) does not operate so as to require the company to do anything that it would not have been required to do if the personal representative were a local representative.

    * (11) A transfer or payment made under subsection (9) and a receipt or acknowledgment of such a payment is, for all purposes, as valid and effectual as if the personal representative were a local representative.

    * (12) For the purposes of this section, an application by a personal representative of a dead person for registration as the holder of a security in place of the dead person is taken to be an instrument of transfer effecting a transfer of the security to the personal representative.

    * (13) The production to a company of a document that is, under the law of a State or Territory, sufficient evidence of probate of the will, or letters of administration of the estate, of a dead person having been granted to a person, is sufficient evidence of the grant (for the company's purposes). This is so despite:

     * (a) anything in its constitution; or

     * (b) in a deed relating to debentures.

##### 1071C  Occupation need not appear in transfer document, register etc.

    * (1) A document transferring securities need not state the occupation of the transferor or transferee and, if it is signed by a person, the signature need not be witnessed.

    * (2) Subsection (1) applies despite anything in:

     * (a) the constitution of:

      * (i) a company; or

      * (ii) a body referred to in paragraph 1073C(a) or (b); or

     * (b) the terms and conditions on which securities are created or issued.

    * (3) The omission from a register, certificate, document transferring securities or other document relating to a security, of a statement of the occupation of a person who is, or is entitled to be, registered as the holder of the security does not breach any law, constitution, trust deed or other document relating to the securities.

##### 1071D  Registration of transfer at request of transferor

    * (1) A written application by the transferor of a security of a company for the transferee's name to be entered in the appropriate register is as effective (for the company's purposes) as if it were an application by the transferee. The application is subject to the same conditions as it would be if it had been made by the transferee.

    * (2) If the transferor of a security of a company requests the company in writing to do so, the company must, by written notice, require a person who has possession, custody or control of either or both of the following:

     * (a) any title documents for the security;

     * (b) the instrument of transfer of the security;

    * to bring it or them into the office of the company within a specified period, to have the document cancelled or rectified and the transfer registered or otherwise dealt with.

    * (3) The period specified under subsection (2) must be not less than 7 and not more than 28 days after the date of the notice.

    * (4) If a person refuses or fails to comply with a notice given under subsection (2), the transferor may apply to the Court for the issue of a summons for that person to appear before the Court and show cause why the documents mentioned in the notice should not be delivered up or produced as required by the notice.

    * (5) The Court may:

     * (a) if the person appears:

      * (i) examine the person upon oath or affirmation; and

      * (ii) receive other evidence; and

     * (b) if the person does not appear after being duly served with the summons--receive evidence in the person's absence; and

     * (c) in either case order the person to deliver up such documents to the company upon such terms or conditions as the Court considers just and reasonable.

    * The costs of the summons and of proceedings on the summons are in the discretion of the Court.

    * (6) Lists of documents required to be brought in under subsection (2) but not brought in in accordance with a requirement made under subsection (2) or delivered up in accordance with an order under subsection (5), must be:

     * (a) exhibited in the office of the company; and

     * (b) advertised in the _Gazette _and in such newspapers and at such times as the company thinks fit.

##### 1071E  Notice of refusal to register transfer

    * If a company refuses to register a transfer of a security of the company, it must, within 2 months after the date on which the transfer was lodged with it, give the transferee notice of the refusal.

        * Note: Failure to comply with this section is an offence (see subsection 1311(1)).

##### 1071F  Remedy for refusal to register transfer or transmission

    * (1) If a relevant authority in relation to a company:

     * (a) refuses or fails to register; or

     * (b) refuses or fails to give its consent or approval to the registration of;

    * a transfer or transmission of securities of the company, the transferee or transmittee may apply to the Court for an order under this section.

    * (2) If the Court is satisfied on the application that the refusal or failure was without just cause, the Court may:

     * (a) order that the transfer or transmission be registered; or

     * (b) make such other order as it thinks just and reasonable, including:

      * (i) in the case of a transfer or transmission of shares--an order providing for the purchase of the shares by a specified member of the company or by the company; and

      * (ii) in the case of a purchase by the company--an order providing for the reduction accordingly of the capital of the company.

    * (3) In this section:

    * **_relevant authority_**, in relation to a company, means:

     * (a) a person who has, 2 or more persons who together have, or a body that has, authority to register a transfer or transmission of securities of the company; or

     * (b) a person, 2 or more persons, or a body, whose consent or approval is required before a transfer or transmission of securities of the company is registered.

##### 1071G  Certification of transfers

    * (1) The certification by a company of an instrument of transfer of securities of the company:

     * (a) is taken as a representation by the company to any person acting on the faith of the certification that there have been produced to the company such documents as on the face of them show prima facie title to the securities in the transferor named in the instrument of transfer; and

     * (b) is not taken as a representation that the transferor has any title to the securities.

    * (2) If a person acts on the faith of a false certification by a company made negligently, the company is under the same liability to the person as if the certification had been made fraudulently.

    * (3) A certification may be expressed to be limited to 42 days or any longer period from the date of certification. If it is, the company and its officers and employees are not, in the absence of fraud, liable in respect of the registration of any transfer of securities comprised in the certification after the end of:

     * (a) the period so limited; or

     * (b) any extension of that period given by the company;

    * if the instrument of transfer has not, within that period, been lodged with the company for registration.

    * (4) For the purposes of this section:

     * (a) an instrument of transfer is taken to be certified if it bears the words "certificate lodged" or words to the like effect; and

     * (b) the certification of an instrument of transfer is taken to be made by a company if:

      * (i) the person issuing the instrument is a person authorised to issue certified instruments of transfer on the company's behalf; and

      * (ii) the certification is signed by a person authorised to certify transfers on the company's behalf or by an officer of the company or of a body corporate so authorised; and

     * (c) a certification that purports to be authenticated by a person's signature or initials (whether handwritten or not) is taken to be signed by the person unless it is shown that the signature or initials:

      * (i) was not or were not placed there by the person; and

      * (ii) was not or were not placed there by any other person authorised to use the signature or initials;

     * for the purpose of certifying transfers on the company's behalf.

##### 1071H  Duties of company with respect to issue of certificates

    * (1) Subject to subsection (2), within 2 months after a company issues a security, the company must:

     * (a) complete and have ready for delivery to the holder of the security all the appropriate certificates or other title documents in connection with the issue of the security; and

     * (b) unless otherwise instructed by the holder, send or deliver the completed certificates or other title documents to:

      * (i) the holder; or

      * (ii) if the holder has instructed the company in writing to send them to a nominated person--that person.

    * Paragraph (a) has effect in relation to shares subject to the conditions on which the shares are issued.

    * (2) If the operating rules of a prescribed CS facility include a provision to the effect that:

     * (a) no document is required by subsection (1) to be completed and delivered by a company in relation to the issue of a security in specified circumstances; or

     * (b) the only document required by subsection (1) to be completed and delivered by a company in relation to the issue of a security in specified circumstances is the document required by the provision;

    * the provision has effect accordingly.

    * (3) Within one month after the date on which a transfer of a security is lodged with a company, the company must:

     * (a) complete and have ready for delivery to the transferee all the appropriate transfer and title documents in connection with the transfer; and

     * (b) unless otherwise instructed by the transferee, send or deliver the completed documents to:

      * (i) the transferee; or

      * (ii) if the transferee has instructed the company in writing to send them to a nominated person--that person.

    * This subsection does not apply to a transfer that the company is for any reason entitled to refuse to register and does not register.

    * (4) The only document required by subsection (3) to be completed and delivered by a company in relation to a transfer covered by the operating rules of a prescribed CS facility is the document (if any) that those rules require to be completed and delivered.

    * (5) A company need not comply:

     * (a) with subsection (1) in relation to the issue of a security; or

     * (b) with subsection (3) in relation to a transfer of a security;

    * this section applies whether or not the trustee has been registered as the holder of the share.

    * (2) On producing such information as the company's directors properly require, the trustee is entitled to:

    * (7) A provision of the company's constitution is void as against the trustee in so far as, apart from this section, it would affect rights attached to the share:

     * (a) because the bankrupt is a bankrupt; or

     * (b) because of some event that led to the bankrupt becoming, or that indicated that the bankrupt was about to become, or might be about to become, a bankrupt; or
