   * **_associated provider_** has the meaning given by subsection (2).

   * **_carer_**: see section 5.

   * **_care supports _**means policies, programs or services directed to carers or the persons for whom they care.

   * **_public service agency _**means an Agency within the meaning of the _Public Service Act 1999_.

   * (2) If a public service care agency enters into a contract or funding arrangement with another person or body (the **_first entity_**) for the first entity to develop, implement, provide or evaluate care supports (the **_funded activities_**):

     * (a) the first entity is an **_associated provider_** in relation to the funded activities; and

     * (b) if the first entity enters into a contract or funding arrangement with another person or body (the **_second entity_**) for the second entity to undertake all or part of the funded activities--the second entity is an **_associated provider _**in relation to the funded activities or the part of the funded activities (as the case requires).

   * (3) Subsection (2) does not apply to a contract or funding arrangement that a public service care agency, or another person or body, enters into with a State or Territory.

##### 5  Meaning of carer

   * (1) For the purpose of this Act, a **_carer_** is an individual who provides personal care, support and assistance to another individual who needs it because that other individual:

     * (b) has a medical condition (including a terminal or chronic illness); or

     * (c) has a mental illness; or

     * (d) is frail and aged.

   * (2) An individual is not a **_carer_** in respect of care, support and assistance he or she provides:

     * (b) in the course of doing voluntary work for a charitable, welfare or community organisation; or

     * (c) as part of the requirements of a course of education or training.

   * (3) To avoid doubt, an individual is not a **_carer_** merely because he or she:

     * (b) lives with an individual who requires care.

### Part 2--The Statement for Australia's Carers

   * (1) Each public service agency is to take all practicable measures to ensure that its employees and agents have an awareness and understanding of the Statement for Australia's Carers.

   * (2) Each public service agency's internal human resources policies, so far as they may significantly affect an employee's caring role, are to be developed having due regard to the Statement for Australia's Carers.

##### 8  Additional obligations of public service care agencies

   * (1) Each public service care agency is to take all practicable measures to ensure that it, and its employees and agents, take action to reflect the principles of the Statement for Australia's Carers in developing, implementing, providing or evaluating care supports.

   * (2) Each public service care agency is to consult carers, or bodies that represent carers, when developing or evaluating care supports.

   * (3) Each public service care agency must prepare a report on its compliance with section 7 and this section in each reporting period. The report must be included in the agency's annual report for the reporting period.

   * (4) Subsection (3) applies, in relation to a particular public service care agency, to:

     * (a) the first full reporting period of the agency that starts on or after the commencement of this Act; and

     * (b) all subsequent reporting periods of the agency.

##### 9  Obligations of associated providers

   * Each associated provider is to take all practicable measures to ensure that: 

     * (a) its officers, employees and agents have an awareness and understanding of the Statement for Australia's Carers; and

     * (b) it, and its officers, employees and agents, take action to reflect the principles of the Statement in developing, implementing, providing or evaluating care supports.

### Part 4--Other matters

##### 10  Act does not create legally enforceable obligations etc.

   * (1) This Act does not create rights or duties that are legally enforceable in judicial or other proceedings.

   * (2) A failure to comply with this Act does not affect the validity of any decision, and is not a ground for the review or challenge of any decision.

   * (3) If a public service agency, or an associated provider, is required by another law of the Commonwealth, or by a law of a State or Territory, to consider particular matters, or to comply with particular requirements, in the exercise of its functions or powers, nothing in this Act is to be taken to require the agency, or the associated provider, to act inconsistently with that law.

##### 11  Act not intended to exclude similar State or Territory laws

   * This Act is not intended to apply to the exclusion of any law of a State or Territory that establishes a Carers Charter (however described), or that otherwise provides for the recognition of carers.

##### 12  Regulations
