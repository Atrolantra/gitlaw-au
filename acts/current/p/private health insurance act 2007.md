## Chapter 3--Complying health insurance products

### Part 31--Introduction

#### Division 50--Introduction

##### 501  What this Chapter is about

    * Broadly, health insurance that is made available to the public must meet the requirements in this Chapter. This means that:

        * (a) the insurance must be communityrated (that is, made available in a way that does not discriminate between people) (see Part 32); and

        * (b) the insurance must be in the form of a complying health insurance product (see Part 33); and

        * (c) the private health insurers who make the products available must meet certain obligations to people insured or seeking to be insured under the products (see Part 34).

##### 505  Private Health Insurance Rules relevant to this Chapter

    * Matters relating to *complying health insurance products are also dealt with in the Private Health Insurance (Complying Product) Rules, the Private Health Insurance (Benefit Requirements) Rules, the Private Health Insurance (Prostheses) Rules and the Private Health Insurance (Accreditation) Rules. The provisions of this Chapter indicate when a particular matter is or may be dealt with in these Rules.

        * Note: These Rules are all made by the Minister under section 33320.

### Part 32--Community rating

#### Division 55--Principle of community rating

##### 551  What this Part is about

    * To ensure that everybody who chooses has access to health insurance, the principle of community rating prevents private health insurers from discriminating between people on the basis of their health or for any other reason described in this Part.

##### 555  Principle of community rating

    * (1) A private health insurer must not:

     * (a) take or fail to take any action; or

     * (b) in making a decision, have regard or fail to have regard to any matter;

    * that would result in the insurer *improperly discriminating between people who are or wish to be insured under a *complying health insurance policy of the insurer.

    * (2) **_Improper discrimination _**is discrimination that relates to:

     * (a) the suffering by a person from a chronic disease, illness or other medical condition or from a disease, illness or medical condition of a particular kind; or

     * (b) the gender, race, sexual orientation or religious belief of a person; or

     * (c) the age of a person, except to the extent allowed under Part 23 (lifetime health cover) or subsection 635(4); or

     * (d) where a person lives, except to the extent allowed under subsection 6610(2) or section 6620; or

     * (e) any other characteristic of a person (including but not just matters such as occupation or leisure pursuits) that is likely to result in an increased need for *hospital treatment or *general treatment; or

     * (f) the frequency with which a person needs hospital treatment or general treatment; or

     * (g) the amount or extent of the benefits to which a person becomes entitled during a period under a *complying health insurance policy, except to the extent allowed under section 6615; or

     * (h) any matter set out in the Private Health Insurance (Complying Product) Rules for the purposes of this paragraph.

    * (3) Despite subsection (2), discrimination by a *restricted access insurer is not improper discrimination to the extent to which the insurer:

     * (a) takes or fails to take an action; or

     * (b) in making a decision, has regard or fails to have regard to a matter;

    * only to ensure that its *complying health insurance products are not made available to persons to whom its constitution or *rules prohibits it from making the products available.

    * (4) Despite subsection (2), discrimination by a private health insurer is not improper discrimination to the extent to which:

     * (a) the insurer:

      * (i) takes or fails to take an action; or

      * (ii) in making a decision, has regard or fails to have regard to a matter; and

     * (b) taking or failing to take the action, or having regard or failing to have regard to that matter, has the effect of the premiums payable under an insurance policy that covers a person who is:

      * (i) employed by a particular person or body; or

      * (ii) under contract to provide services to a particular person or body;

     * being the subject of a discount or discounts (whether or not the policy also covers one or more persons who are not so employed and are not under such a contract); and

     * (c) the premiums meet the premium requirement in section 665.

    * (5) To avoid doubt, subsection (4) does not apply if taking or failing to take the action, or having regard or failing to have regard to that matter, has the effect of an insurance policy being cancelled because a person ceases to be an employee of, or ceases to be under contract to provide services to, a particular employer.

##### 5510  Closed products

    * The principle of community rating in section 555 does not prevent a private health insurer from refusing to make available to a person a *complying health insurance product that the insurer is no longer making available to anyone.

##### 5515  Pilot projects

    * (1) The principle of community rating in section 555 does not prevent a private health insurer from:

     * (a) taking or failing to take any action; or

     * (b) in making a decision, having regard or failing to have regard to any matter;

    * for the purposes of conducting a pilot project in accordance with the Private Health Insurance (Complying Product) Rules.

    * (2) The Private Health Insurance (Complying Product) Rules may permit pilot projects of a kind specified in the Rules to be conducted by private health insurers in accordance with requirements specified in the Rules.

     * (c) would be the amount mentioned in paragraph (a) or (b) except that a different amount is payable:

      * (i) because of the application of Part 23 (lifetime health cover); or

      * (ii) because of a discount or discounts allowed under subsection (2), if the total percentage discount (not counting discounts available for the reason in paragraph (3)(f)) does not exceed the percentage specified in the Private Health Insurance (Complying Product) Rules as the maximum percentage discount allowed; or

      * (iii) because of a combination of subparagraphs (i) and (ii).

    * (2) A discount is allowed if:

    * (3) A discount may be for any of these reasons:

     * (a) because premiums are paid at least 3 months in advance;

     * (g) for a reason set out in the Private Health Insurance (Complying Product) Rules.

##### 6610  Minister's approval of premiums

     * (b) at least 60 days before the day on which the insurer proposes the change to take effect.

    * (2) The application may propose different changes for policies in the *product, but the proposed changed amount must be the same for each policy in the product that belongs to the same *product subgroup.

    * Neither: 

     * (a) the community rating principle in section 555; nor

     * (b) the community rating requirement in paragraph 661(1)(b);

    * prevents a private health insurer from determining a person's entitlement under a *complying health insurance policy to a benefit for *general treatment (other than *hospitalsubstitute treatment) in respect of a period by having regard to the amount of benefits for that kind of treatment already claimed for the person in respect of the period.

    * Neither: 

     * (a) the community rating principle in section 555; nor

     * (b) the community rating requirements in section 661;

#### Division 69--Coverage requirements

     * (a) the only treatments the policy *covers are:

        * Note: So, for example, a provision of this Act that applies a particular provision of the _Corporations Act 2001_ also applies any regulations that have effect for the purposes of that provision (unless a contrary intention appears).

    * (2) An **_application provision_** is a provision of this Division that:

     * (a) provides for the application of a provision, or a group of provisions (including a Chapter, Part, Division or Subdivision), of the _Corporations Act 2001_; or

    * (4) If an *application provision contains a power for the Private Health Insurance (Health Benefits Fund Enforcement) Rules to modify an *applied Corporations Act provision:

     * (b) the modifications (whether of the applied Corporations Act provision or of regulations or instruments referred to in paragraph (a)) that may be made include omissions, additions and substitutions.

    * (5) The fact that provision is made in this Act for a specific modification of one or more *applied Corporations Act provisions does not imply that further modifications of that provision, or any of those provisions, consistent with that specific modification, should not be made by the Private Health Insurance (Health Benefits Fund Enforcement) Rules.

    * Corporations Act definitions and interpretation principles

    * (6) The definitions and interpretation principles that have effect in or under the _Corporations Act 2001_ have the same effect in relation to:

     * (a) an *applied Corporations Act provision; or

     * (b) a provision of regulations or another instrument that is applied as a result of subsection (1);

    * as that provision applies for the purposes of a provision of this Division, unless a contrary intention appears in an *application provision or in a modification made by the Private Health Insurance (Health Benefits Fund Enforcement) Rules.

    * Things that may be done under regulations under the Corporations Act

    * (7) If an *applied Corporations Act provision allows something to be done in or by regulations, then:

     * (a) the Private Health Insurance (Health Benefits Fund Enforcement) Rules may do that thing for the purposes of the applied Corporations Act provision; and

     * (b) if they do, any regulations or instruments that are applied as a result of subsection (1) are ineffective, for the purposes of this Division, to the extent that they are inconsistent with the provisions of the Private Health Insurance (Health Benefits Fund Enforcement) Rules that do that thing.

##### 22010  Binding nature of Court orders

    * Any orders made by the Federal Court under section 2205: 

     * (a) are binding on all persons; and
