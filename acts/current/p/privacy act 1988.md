    * (2) An act or practice of an entity is an**_ interference with the privacy of an individual_** if:

     * (a) the act or practice breaches a provision of Part IIIA in relation to personal information about the individual; or

     * (b) the act or practice breaches the registered CR code in relation to personal information about the individual and the code binds the entity.

    * Contracted service providers

    * (3) An act or practice of an organisation is an **_interference with the privacy of an individual_** if:

     * (a) the act or practice relates to personal information about the individual; and

     * (b) the organisation is a contracted service provider for a Commonwealth contract (whether or not the organisation is a party to the contract); and

     * (c) the act or practice does not breach:

      * (i) an Australian Privacy Principle; or

      * (ii) a registered APP code that binds the organisation;

     * in relation to the personal information because of a provision of the contract that is inconsistent with the principle or code; and

     * (d) the act is done, or the practice is engaged in, in a manner contrary to, or inconsistent with, that provision.

        * Note: See subsections 6A(2) and 6B(2) for when an act or practice does not breach an Australian Privacy Principle or a registered APP code.

    * Tax file numbers

    * (4) An act or practice is an **_interference with the privacy of an individual_** if:

     * (a) it is an act or practice of a file number recipient and the act or practice breaches a rule issued under section 17 in relation to tax file number information that relates to the individual; or

     * (b) the act or practice involves an unauthorised requirement or request for disclosure of the tax file number of the individual.

    * Other interferences with privacy

    * (5) An act or practice is an **_interference with the privacy of an individual_** if the act or practice:

     * (a) constitutes a breach of Part 2 of the _Datamatching Program (Assistance and Tax) Act 1990_ or the rules issued under section 12 of that Act; or

     * (b) constitutes a breach of the rules issued under section 135AA of the _National Health Act 1953_.

        * Note: Other Acts may provide that an act or practice is an interference with the privacy of an individual. For example, see the _Healthcare Identifiers Act 2010_, the _AntiMoney Laundering and CounterTerrorism Financing Act 2006_ and the _Personal Property Securities Act 2009_.

##### 13B  Related bodies corporate

    * Acts or practices that are not interferences with privacy

    * (1) Despite subsection 13(1), each of the following acts or practices of an organisation that is a body corporate is not an **_interference with the privacy of an individual_**:

     * (a) the collection of personal information (other than sensitive information) about the individual by the body corporate from a related body corporate;

     * (b) the disclosure of personal information (other than sensitive information) about the individual by the body corporate to a related body corporate.

        * Note: Subsection (1) lets related bodies corporate share personal information. However, in using or holding the information, they must comply with the Australian Privacy Principles and a registered APP code that binds them. For example, there is an interference with privacy if:

          * (a) a body corporate uses personal information it has collected from a related body corporate; and

          * (b) the use breaches Australian Privacy Principle 6 (noting that the collecting body's primary purpose of collection will be taken to be the same as that of the related body).

    * (1A) However, paragraph (1)(a) does not apply to the collection by a body corporate of personal information (other than sensitive information) from:

     * (a) a related body corporate that is not an organisation; or

     * (b) a related body corporate whose disclosure of the information to the body corporate is an exempt act or exempt practice for the purposes of paragraph 7(1)(ee); or

     * (c) a related body corporate whose disclosure of the information to the body corporate is not an interference with privacy because of section 13D.

        * Note: The effect of subsection (1A) is that a body corporate's failure to comply with the Australian Privacy Principles, or a registered APP code that binds the body, in collecting personal information about an individual from a related body corporate covered by that subsection is an interference with the privacy of the individual.

    * Relationship with subsection 13(3)

    * (2) Subsection (1) does not prevent an act or practice of an organisation from being an **_interference with the privacy of an individual_** under subsection 13(3).

##### 13C  Change in partnership because of change in partners

    * Acts or practices that are not interferences with privacy

    * (1) If:

     * (a) an organisation (the **_new partnership_**) that is a partnership forms at the same time as, or immediately after, the dissolution of another partnership (the **_old partnership_**); and

     * (b) at least one person who was a partner in the old partnership is a partner in the new partnership; and

     * (c) the new partnership carries on a business that is the same as, or similar to, a business carried on by the old partnership; and

     * (d) the new partnership holds, immediately after its formation, personal information about an individual that the old partnership held immediately before its dissolution;

    * neither the disclosure (if any) by the old partnership, nor the collection (if any) by the new partnership, of the information that was necessary for the new partnership to hold the information immediately after its formation constitutes an **_interference with the privacy of the individual_**.

        * Note: Subsection (1) lets personal information be passed on from an old to a new partnership. However, in using or holding the information, they must comply with the Australian Privacy Principles and a registered APP code that binds them. For example, the new partnership's use of personal information collected from the old partnership may constitute an interference with privacy if it breaches Australian Privacy Principle 6.

    * Effect of subsection (1)

    * (2) Subsection (1) has effect despite subsections 13(1) and (3).

##### 13D  Overseas act required by foreign law

    * Acts or practices that are not interferences with privacy

    * (1) An act or practice of an organisation done or engaged in outside  and an external Territory is not an **_interference with the privacy of an individual_** if the act or practice is required by an applicable law of a foreign country.

    * Effect of subsection (1)

    * (2) Subsection (1) has effect despite subsections 13(1) and (3).

##### 13E  Effect of sections 13B, 13C and 13D

    * Sections 13B, 13C and 13D do not prevent an act or practice of an organisation from being an **_interference with the privacy of an individual_** under subsection 13(2), (4) or (5).

##### 13F  Act or practice not covered by section 13 is not an interference with privacy

    * An act or practice that is not covered by section 13 is not an **_interference with the privacy of an individual_**.

##### 13G  Serious and repeated interferences with privacy

    * An entity contravenes this subsection if: 

     * (a) the entity does an act, or engages in a practice, that is a serious interference with the privacy of an individual; or

     * (b) the entity repeatedly does an act, or engages in a practice, that is an interference with the privacy of one or more individuals.

      * Civil penalty: 2,000 penalty units.
