     * (b) PBR is granted to another person in another plant variety; and

     * (c) the Secretary makes a declaration, on application by the firstmentioned person, that the other plant variety is an essentially derived variety from the initial variety;

    * the right granted in the initial variety extends, with effect from the date of the declaration, to that other plant variety. 

##### 13  Extension of PBR to cover certain dependent plant varieties

    * Subject to section 23, if PBR is granted in a plant variety (the **_initial variety_**), the right extends to:

     * (a) any other plant variety that:

      * (i) is not clearly distinguishable from the initial variety; and

      * (ii) is clearly distinguishable from any plant variety that was a matter of common knowledge at the time of the grant of PBR in the initial variety; and

     * (b) any other plant variety that cannot be reproduced except by the repeated use of the initial variety or of a variety referred to in paragraph (a);

    * whether or not that other plant variety was in existence at the time PBR was granted in the initial variety. 

##### 14  Extension of PBR to harvested material in certain circumstances

    * (1) If:

     * (a) propagating material of a plant variety covered by PBR is produced or reproduced without the authorisation of the grantee; and

     * (b) the grantee does not have a reasonable opportunity to exercise the grantee's right in relation to the propagating material; and

     * (c) material is harvested from the propagating material;

    * section 11 operates as if the harvested material were propagating material. 

    * (2) Subsection (1) applies to so much of the material harvested by a farmer from propagating material conditioned and reproduced in the circumstances set out in subsection 17(1) as is not itself required by the farmer, for the farmer's own use, for reproductive purposes. 

##### 15  Extension of PBR to products obtained from harvested material in certain circumstances

    * If: 

     * (a) propagating material of a plant variety covered by PBR is produced or reproduced without authorisation of the grantee; and

     * (b) the grantee does not have a reasonable opportunity to exercise the grantee's rights in relation to the propagating material; and

     * (c) material is harvested from plants grown from the propagating material but the grantee does not have, in the circumstances set out in section 14, a reasonable opportunity of exercising the grantee's rights in the harvested material; and

     * (d) products are made from the harvested material;

    * section 11 operates as if those products were propagating material. 

##### 16  Certain acts done for private, experimental or breeding purposes do not infringe PBR

    * Any act done in relation to a plant variety covered by PBR that is done: 

     * (a) privately and for noncommercial purposes; or

     * (b) for experimental purposes; or

     * (c) for the purpose of breeding other plant varieties;

    * does not infringe the PBR. 

##### 17  Conditioning and use of farm saved seed does not infringe PBR

    * (1) If:

     * (a) a person engaged in farming activities legitimately obtains propagating material of a plant variety covered by PBR either by purchase or by previous operation of this section, for use in such activities; and

     * (b) the plant variety is not included within a taxon declared under subsection (2) to be a taxon to which this subsection does not apply; and

     * (c) the person subsequently harvests further propagating material from plants grown from that firstmentioned propagating material;

    * the PBR is not infringed by: 

     * (d) the conditioning of so much of that further propagating material as is required for the person's use for reproductive purposes; or

     * (e) the reproduction of that further propagating material. 

    * (2) The regulations may declare a particular taxon to be a taxon to which subsection (1) does not apply. 

##### 18  Restriction on grantee's rights in certain circumstances

    * (1) If:

     * (a) a person is authorised by or under a law of the Commonwealth or of a State or Territory to do an act referred to in a paragraph of section 11 in relation to propagating material of a plant variety; and

     * (b) the act is one which (apart from this provision) would require authorisation from the grantee of PBR in the plant variety; and

     * (c) before the person does the act, the person either pays equitable remuneration to the grantee in respect of the act or arranges for the payment of such remuneration; and

     * (d) the person does the act;

    * then the grantee is not entitled to exercise PBR in the plant variety against the person in respect of that act.

    * (2) To avoid doubt, subsection (1) does not limit the operation of section 17 in relation to the conditioning or reproduction of propagating material in the circumstances referred to in that section.

    * (3) In this section:

    * **_equitable remuneration_**, in relation to an act done in relation to propagating material of a plant variety, means an amount:

     * (a) that is agreed between the person proposing to undertake the act and the grantee of PBR in the plant variety; or

     * (b) if agreement cannot be reached under paragraph (a)--determined by a court of competent jurisdiction to constitute equitable remuneration in relation to the act.

##### 19  Reasonable public access to plant varieties covered by PBR

    * (1) Subject to subsection (11), the grantee of PBR in a plant variety must take all reasonable steps to ensure reasonable public access to that plant variety. 

    * (2) Reasonable public access to a plant variety covered by PBR is taken to be satisfied if propagating material of reasonable quality is available to the public at reasonable prices, or as gifts to the public, in sufficient quantities to meet demand. 

    * (3) For the purpose of ensuring reasonable public access to a plant variety covered by PBR, the Secretary may, on behalf of the grantee, in accordance with subsections (4) to (10), license a person whom the Secretary considers appropriate:

     * (a) to sell propagating material of plants of that variety; or

     * (b) to produce propagating material of plants of that variety for sale;

    * during such period as the Secretary considers appropriate and on such terms and conditions (including the provision of reasonable remuneration to the grantee) as the Secretary considers would be granted by the grantee in the normal course of business. 

    * (4) If, at any time more than 2 years after the grant of PBR in a plant variety, a person considers:

     * (a) that the grantee is failing to comply with subsection (1) in relation to the variety; and

     * (b) that the failure affects the person's interests;

    * the person may make a written request to the Secretary to exercise a power under subsection (3) in relation to the variety. 

    * (5) A request must:

     * (a) set out the reasons why the person considers that the grantee is failing to comply with subsection (1); and

     * (b) give particulars of the way in which the person considers that the failure affects the person's interests; and

     * (c) give an address of the person for the purposes of notifications under this section.

     * (b) setting out particulars of any licence the Secretary proposes to grant; and

     * (c) inviting persons to apply in writing to the Secretary, within 30 days of the publication of the notice, to be granted that licence. 

    * (9) The Secretary must not grant any such licence unless:

     * (a) the Secretary has considered all applications made in response to the invitation; and

     * (b) at least one month before granting any such licence, the Secretary has:

      * (i) given written notice to each such applicant of the name of the proposed licensee; and

      * (ii) given public notice of the name of the proposed licensee.

    * (10) If the Secretary:

     * (a) has granted a person a licence to produce propagating material of plants of a particular variety; and

     * (b) is satisfied that the person will be unable to obtain such propagating material at a reasonable price or without charge;

    * the Secretary may, on behalf of the grantee, make that propagating material available to the person from material stored at a genetic resource centre.

       * Note: A decision under this subsection to make propagating material available is reviewable by the AAT under section 77. 

    * (11) This section does not apply in relation to a plant variety in respect of which the Secretary certifies, in writing, at the time of the grant of PBR, that he or she is satisfied that plants of that variety have no direct use as a consumer product.

       * Note: A decision under this subsection is reviewable by the AAT under section 77. 

##### 20  PBR is personal property

    * (1) PBR is personal property and, subject to any conditions imposed under section 49, is capable of assignment, or of transmission by will or by operation of law. 

    * (2) An assignment of PBR (otherwise than because of the order of a court) does not have effect unless it is in writing signed by, or on behalf of, the assignor and assignee. 

    * (3) If a grantee of PBR in a plant variety gives another person a licence in that right, the licence binds every successor in title to the interest of that grantee to the same extent as it was binding on that grantee of the PBR. 

       * Note 1: The _Personal Property Securities Act 2009_ applies to PBR, and any licence in PBR, as **_intellectual property_** (see paragraph (d) of the definition of that phrase in section 10 of that Act). That Act deals with security interests in personal property, including intellectual property and intellectual property licences.

       * Note 2: Section 106 of the _Personal Property Securities Act 2009_ corresponds to subsection 20(3) of this section. Section 106 of that Act provides for security agreements in relation to intellectual property licences (or sublicences) to be binding on successors in title to the licences (or sublicences).

##### 21  Registrar must be notified of an assignment of PBR

    * (1) If a person (the **_claimant_**) claims that PBR was assigned or transmitted to the claimant, the claimant must inform the Registrar in writing that the claimant has acquired that right, giving particulars of the manner in which that right was acquired, within 30 days after acquiring that right. 

    * (2) If the Registrar is satisfied that the right has been so assigned or transmitted, the Registrar must amend the Register by entering the name of the claimant as the holder of that right. 

    * (3) If the Registrar enters the name of the claimant on the Register as the holder of PBR, the Registrar must, within 30 days after entering the name, give written notice to the claimant and to the person who was the holder before the entry was made, stating that the entry has been made. 

    * (4) If the Registrar is not satisfied that PBR has been assigned or transmitted to the claimant, the Registrar must, as soon as possible:

     * (a) give written notice to the claimant:

      * (i) telling the claimant that the Registrar is not so satisfied; and

      * (ii) setting out the reasons why the Registrar is not so satisfied; and

     * (b) give written notice to the person entered on the Register as the holder of the right:

      * (i) setting out particulars of the information given by the claimant; and

      * (ii) telling the claimant that the Registrar is not so satisfied; and

      * (iii) setting out the reasons why the Registrar is not so satisfied. 

    * (5) A claimant must include, in the notice to the Registrar informing of the assignment or transmission, an address in  for the service of documents in accordance with this Act.

       * Note: A decision under this section to amend or to refuse to amend the Register is reviewable by the AAT under section 77. 

##### 22  Duration of PBR

    * (1) Subject to subsections (4) and (5), PBR in a plant variety begins on the day that the grant of PBR in the variety is made. 

    * (2) Subject to subsections (3), (4) and (5), PBR in a plant variety lasts for:

     * (a) in the case of trees and vines--25 years; and

     * (b) for any other variety--20 years. 

    * (3) The regulations may provide that PBR in a plant variety included within a specified taxon lasts for a longer period than is specified in subsection (2). 

    * (4) PBR in a plant variety that is a dependent plant variety of another plant variety begins on:

     * (a) the day that the grant of PBR in the other plant variety is made; or

     * (b) the day that dependent variety comes into existence;

    * whichever occurs last, and ends when PBR in the other variety ceases.

    * (5) If:

     * (a) PBR is held in a plant variety (the **_initial variety_**); and

     * (b) another plant variety is declared under section 40 to be an essentially derived variety of the initial variety;

    * PBR in the initial variety extends to the essentially derived variety from the day on which that declaration is made until the day on which PBR in the initial variety ends. 

##### 23  Exhaustion of PBR

    * (1) PBR granted in a plant variety does not extend to any act referred to in section 11:

     * (a) in relation to propagating material of the variety; or

     * (b) in relation to propagating material of any essentially derived variety or dependent plant variety;

    * that takes place after the propagating material has been sold by the grantee or with the grantee's consent unless that act:

     * (c) involves further production or reproduction of the material; or

     * (d) involves the export of the material:

      * (i) to a country that does not provide PBR in relation to the variety; and

      * (ii) for a purpose other than final consumption.

    * (2) If:

     * (a) a plant variety is declared to be an essentially derived variety of another plant variety (the **_initial variety_**); and

     * (b) PBR in the essentially derived variety is held both by the grantee of PBR in the essentially derived variety and by the grantee of PBR in the initial variety;

    * the reference in subsection (1) to propagating material sold by the grantee or with the grantee's consent is a reference to propagating material sold by, or with the consent of, both of the grantees referred to in paragraph (b). 

    * (3) If, under subsection 18(1), equitable remuneration is paid, or arranged to be paid, to the grantee of PBR in a plant variety in respect of an act (the **_first act_**) in relation to propagating material of that variety before the person does the act, PBR in that variety does not extend to any later act (the **_later act_**) referred to in section 11 in relation to that propagating material unless the later act:

     * (a) involves the further production or reproduction of that propagating material; or

     * (b) involves the export of the material:

      * (i) to a country that does not provide PBR in relation to the variety; and

      * (ii) for a purpose other than final consumption.

    * (4) To avoid doubt, nothing in subsection (1) or (3) prevents the exercise of the rights of the grantee of PBR in a plant variety in relation to any propagating material of that variety that is obtained by reproduction of the propagating material to which that subsection applies.

     * (a) make an objection, under section 35, to the granting of PBR in the second variety; and

     * (b) in the alternative, if PBR is granted to another person in the second variety--apply under subsection (1) for a declaration that the second variety is essentially derived from the initial variety. 

    * (3) If the second variety:

     * (a) is the subject of an application for PBR; and

     * (b) is also the subject of an application for a declaration of essential derivation;

    * then, unless and until the Secretary decides to grant the application for PBR:

     * (c) the Secretary must not make the declaration of essential derivation; but

     * (d) the Secretary may, in his or her discretion:

      * (i) examine both the application for PBR and the application for a declaration of essential derivation at the same time; and

      * (ii) for the purpose only of examining the application for a declaration of essential derivation--treat the applicant for PBR as the grantee of PBR in the variety.

    * (6) If the initial variety has itself been declared to be essentially derived from another variety, the Secretary must refuse to declare the second variety essentially derived from:

     * (a) the initial variety; and

     * (b) inform the applicant for the declaration in writing, to that effect, and give the applicant reasons for the decision. 

    * (7) If the initial variety has not been so declared, the Secretary must determine, on the basis of the application, whether the Secretary is satisfied that there is a _prima facie_ case that the second variety is an essentially derived variety of the initial variety. 

    * (8) If the Secretary is satisfied of that _prima facie_ case, the Secretary must:

     * (a) inform the applicant and the grantee of PBR in the second variety that the Secretary is so satisfied; and

     * (b) inform the grantee of PBR in the second variety that, unless the grantee establishes, within 30 days after being so informed or such longer period as the Secretary allows, that the second variety is not an essentially derived variety of the initial variety, the Secretary will, at the end of that period, declare the second variety to be such an essentially derived variety.

     * (b) by notice in writing given to the grantee of PBR in the second variety, tell that grantee that he or she is so satisfied. 

    * (12) While a declaration that the second variety is essentially derived from the initial variety remains in force, section 19 applies in relation to the second variety as if:

     * (a) the references in that section to the grantee, in relation to that variety were references both to the person holding PBR in that variety and to the person holding PBR in the initial variety; and

     * (b) the reference in subsection 19(4) to 2 years after the grant of PBR were a reference to 2 years after the grant of PBR in the second variety whether or not the declaration of essential derivation was made at the same time or a later time; and
