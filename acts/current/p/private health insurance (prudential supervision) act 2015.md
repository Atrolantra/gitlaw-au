     * (b) if there is more than one receiving fund--those assets and liabilities would be fairly distributed between the receiving funds; and

     * (c) the restructure will not result in any contravention of prudential standards_._

        * Note: If APRA is satisfied with a recommendation that the external management cease, then the external management ends when notice is given under this subsection (see paragraph 62(2)(c)).

    * Additional steps to be taken by APRA if satisfied with certain kinds of recommended course of action

    * (5) APRA rules may provide for what is to be done if the course of action in relation to which APRA is satisfied as mentioned in subsection (2) is a course of action that is not of a kind specified in subsection 59(4) or (5).

    * If APRA is not satisfied with a recommended course of action

    * (6) If APRA is not satisfied as mentioned in subsection (2), APRA may take a different course of action that APRA is satisfied will, in the circumstances, be in the interests of policy holders of the fund.

    * (7) The courses of action that APRA may take under subsection (6) include:

     * (a) APRA applying to the Federal Court for an order or orders in relation to the responsible insurer for the fund implementing a scheme of arrangement concerning the business of the fund; and

     * (b) APRA applying to the Court for an order or orders for the appointment of a terminating manager of the health benefits funds of the responsible insurer.

##### 61  Federal Court orders in respect of schemes of arrangement

    * (1) If, under subsection 60(3), APRA directs the external manager to apply under this subsection to give effect to a course of action specified in paragraph 59(4)(a), the external manager must apply to the Federal Court for an order or orders to give effect to the course of action.

##### Subdivision F--Miscellaneous

##### 62  When an external management begins and ends

    * (1) The external management of a health benefits fund begins when an external manager is appointed under section 51 to administer the fund.

    * (2) The external management of a health benefits fund ends when:

     * (a) APRA terminates the appointment of the external manager and does not appoint a replacement external manager; or

     * (b) a voluntary deed of arrangement relating to the fund is executed; or

     * (c) APRA notifies the external manager, under subsection 60(2), that it has accepted the external manager's recommendation, made under subsection 59(3), that the external management cease; or

     * (d) the Federal Court makes an order or orders under section 61 for a course of action approved by APRA and incorporated in a scheme of arrangement; or

     * (e) a terminating manager of the fund is appointed.

##### 63  Effect of things done during external management of health benefits funds

    * A payment made, transaction entered into, or other act or thing done, in good faith, by, or with the consent of, the external manager of a health benefits fund:

     * (a) is valid and effectual for the purposes of this Act and the _Private Health Insurance Act 2007_, and for the purposes of the _Corporations Act 2001_ as it applies in relation to the fund; and

     * (b) is not liable to be set aside in a termination of the fund.

##### 64  Disclaimer of onerous property

    * (1) In the application of the provisions of Division 7A of Part 5.6 of Chapter 5 of the _Corporations Act 2001_ for the purpose of determining the power of an external manager of a health benefits fund to disclaim property of the fund, those provisions have effect as if:

     * (a) the external manager were the liquidator of the company that the fund is taken to constitute; and

     * (b) the references in subsections 568B(3) and 568E(5) of that Act to the company's creditors were references to the policy holders of the fund.

    * (2) A disclaimer by an external manager of a health benefits fund has the same effect, and the external manager is under the same obligations, for the purposes of this Act, as if the disclaimer had been made under Division 7A of Part 5.6 of Chapter 5 of the _Corporations Act 2001_.

##### 65  Application of provisions of Corporations Act

    * Regulations etc. under the Corporations Act

    * (1) A reference in an application provision to an applied Corporations Act provision includes (unless the contrary intention appears) a reference to any regulations or other instruments in force for the purposes of that provision, or any of those provisions, of the _Corporations Act 2001_.

        * Note: So, for example, a provision of this Act that applies a particular provision of the _Corporations Act 2001_ also applies any regulations that have effect for the purposes of that provision (unless a contrary intention appears).

    * (2) An **_application provision_** is a provision of this Division that:

     * (a) provides for the application of a provision, or a group of provisions (including a Chapter, Part, Division or Subdivision), of the _Corporations Act 2001_; or

     * (b) refers to a provision, or group of provisions, of the _Corporations Act 2001_ as so applied.

    * (3) An **_applied Corporations Act provision_** is a provision, or a provision in a group of provisions, of the _Corporations Act 2001_ that is applied as mentioned in paragraph (2)(a).

    * Modifications under APRA rules

    * (4) If an application provision contains a power for APRA rules to modify an applied Corporations Act provision the power extends to modifying any regulations or other instruments, in force for the purposes of that provision of the _Corporations Act 2001_, that are applied as a result of subsection (1).

    * (5) The fact that provision is made in this Act for a specific modification of one or more applied Corporations Act provisions does not imply that further modifications of that provision, or any of those provisions, consistent with that specific modification, should not be made by APRA rules.

    * Corporations Act definitions and interpretation principles

    * (6) The definitions and interpretation principles that have effect in or under the _Corporations Act 2001_ have the same effect in relation to:

     * (a) an applied Corporations Act provision; or

     * (b) a provision of regulations or another instrument that is applied as a result of subsection (1);

    * as that provision applies for the purposes of a provision of this Division, unless a contrary intention appears in an application provision or in a modification made by APRA rules.

    * Things that may be done under regulations under the Corporations Act

    * (7) If an applied Corporations Act provision allows something to be done in or by regulations, then:

     * (a) APRA rules may do that thing for the purposes of the applied Corporations Act provision; and

     * (b) if they do, any regulations or instruments that are applied as a result of subsection (1) are ineffective, for the purposes of this Division, to the extent that they are inconsistent with the provisions of APRA rules that do that thing.

#### Division 7--Ordering the termination of health benefits funds

##### 66  Applications by external managers to the Federal Court

    * (1) If, under subsection 60(4), APRA directs the external manager to apply under this subsection for the appointment of a terminating manager of the health benefits funds of a private health insurer, the external manager must apply to the Federal Court for an order or orders to give effect to such an appointment.

    * (2) APRA and any other person likely to be affected by the termination of the funds are entitled to be heard on the application.

##### 67  Orders made on applications for appointments of terminating managers

    * (1) On an application under subsection 66(1), or under paragraph 60(7)(b), the Federal Court may make an order for the appointment of a terminating manager of the health benefits funds of a private health insurer, and any related orders.

    * (2) However, the Federal Court must not make an order for the appointment of a terminating manager unless it is satisfied that doing so will, in the circumstances, be in the interests of the policy holders of the funds.

##### 68  Notice of appointments

    * If the Federal Court orders the appointment of a terminating manager of the health benefits funds of a private health insurer, APRA must give the insurer written notice of the person appointed as the terminating manager.

##### 69  Application of other provisions if Federal Court orders appointment of a terminating manager

    * If the Federal Court orders the appointment of a terminating manager of the health benefits funds of a private health insurer, then, subject to any other orders made by the Court, Subdivisions B, C and D of Division 5 apply as if APRA had approved the termination of the health benefits funds, and as if the notice given under section 68 were a notification under subsection 37(2).

#### Division 8--External managers and terminating managers

##### Subdivision A--Powers of managers

    * (1) When exercising a power as manager of a health benefits fund, the manager is taken to be acting as the agent of the responsible insurer for the fund.

##### 73  Directors etc. to help managers

    * (1) As soon as practicable after the external management or terminating management of a health benefits fund begins, each director of the responsible insurer for the fund must:

     * (a) the conduct of the affairs of the insurer in such a way as:

      * (i) to keep the insurer in a sound financial position; or

      * (ii) not to cause or promote instability in the Australian private health insurance system; or

     * (b) the conduct of the affairs of the insurer with integrity, prudence and professional skill.

     * (a) section 46AA of the _Acts Interpretation Act 1901_; and

     * (b) section 14 of the _Legislative Instruments Act 2003_.

     * (d) set an amount to be appropriated from the Consolidated Revenue Fund under an appropriation in this Act;

     * (e) directly amend the text of this Act.

    * (9) APRA may, under section 15 of the _Australian Prudential Regulation Authority Act 1998_, delegate the power to make, vary or revoke prudential standards, but only if the delegation is to:

     * (a) an APRA member (within the meaning of that Act); or

     * (b) an APRA staff member who is an executive general manager or equivalent.

##### 93  Additional matters in relation to standards that are not legislative instruments

    * (1) A prudential standard referred to in paragraph 92(3)(c), or an instrument varying or revoking such a standard, has effect:

     * (a) from the day on which the standard or instrument is made; or

     * (b) if the standard or instrument specifies a later day--from that later day.

    * (2) If APRA makes, varies or revokes a prudential standard referred to in paragraph 92(3)(c), it must, as soon as practicable:

      * (ii) any other private health insurer to which the standard will (because of the variation) apply; or

     * (c) in the case of revoking a standard--give notice of the revocation to each private health insurer to which the standard (as in force before the revocation) applied.

##### 94  Compliance with prudential standards

    * A private health insurer must comply with prudential standards that apply in relation to the insurer.

##### 95  Notice of contravention of prudential standards or of other matters that materially affect financial position

    * (1) A private health insurer commits an offence if:

     * (a) the insurer becomes aware of:

      * (i) a contravention by it of a prudential standard, other than a contravention that is merely of a minor or technical nature; or

      * (ii) any other matter or occurrence that materially affects its financial position; and

     * (b) the insurer fails to notify APRA, as soon as practicable, in writing of the contravention or of the other matter or occurrence.

      * Penalty: 30 penalty units.

        * Note: If a body corporate is convicted of an offence against this subsection, subsection 4B(3) of the _Crimes Act 1914_ allows a court to impose a fine of up to 5 times the penalty stated above.

    * (2) A notification given to APRA of a matter referred to in paragraph (1)(a) must not include personal information relating to a person insured under a complying health insurance product that is referable to a health benefits fund conducted by the insurer, unless the information relates to prudential matters relating to the insurer.
