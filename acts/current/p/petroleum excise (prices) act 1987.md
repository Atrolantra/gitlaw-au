### Part --Determination of prices for condensate

##### 5  Purpose of Part

    * (1) The purpose of this Part is to allow the Minister to establish prices of condensate which are used in imposing duties of excise on condensate.

    * (2) It does so by providing that the Act, in addition to its general operation, operates as if:

     * (a) references to excisable crude petroleum oil were references to excisable condensate; and

     * (b) references to stabilised crude petroleum oil, crude petroleum oil and oil were references to condensate.

##### 5A  Additional operation of Act

    * (1) In addition to the operation of this Act apart from this Part, this Act applies as if the modifications set out in subsections (2) and (3) were made.

    * (2) The first modification is that each reference in this Act (other than the definition of **_excisable crude petroleum oil_** in subsection 4(1)) to excisable crude petroleum oil is taken to be a reference to excisable condensate.

    * (3) The second modification is that each reference to:

     * (a) stabilised crude petroleum oil; or

     * (b) crude petroleum oil; or

     * (c) oil;

    * in this Act (other than the title of this Act) is taken to be a reference to condensate.

    * (4) Nothing in this section affects the operation of references to the following in the regulations, or in the _Excise Act 1901_ or the _Excise Tariff Act 1921_:

     * (a) excisable crude petroleum oil;

     * (b) stabilised crude petroleum oil;

     * (c) crude petroleum oil;

     * (d) oil.

### Part II--Determination of prices

##### 6  Oil producers to give certain information

    * (1) An oil producer of excisable crude petroleum oil entered for home consumption during a particular month shall, in respect of each transaction entered into by the producer concerning that oil, give to the Minister such information as is prescribed.

    * (1A) The information prescribed for the purposes of subsection (1) may differ according to whether or not the transaction entered into by the oil producer relates to excisable crude petroleum oil produced from a production area while that area is declared to be a limited production area.

    * (1B) If, in respect of excisable crude petroleum oil produced by an oil producer from a particular production area:

     * (a) the volume of that oil entered for home consumption before the end of each of 3 consecutive months (whether in the same financial year or not) is less than 80% of the free volume of excisable crude petroleum oil in respect of that month, worked out in accordance with subsection (1G); and

     * (b) the Minister is satisfied that the volume of that oil likely to be entered for home consumption before the end of any future month is unlikely, having regard to production statistics and any other relevant factor known to the Minister, to exceed 80% of the free volume of that oil in respect of that future month, worked out in accordance with subsection (1G);

    * the Minister may declare in writing that production area to be a limited production area and, if the Minister does so, he or she must notify the oil producer concerned of that declaration.

    * (1C) If, in respect of excisable crude petroleum oil produced by an oil producer from a particular production area:

     * (a) paragraph (1B)(a) applies in respect of any period of 3 consecutive months; but

     * (b) the Minister does not declare that production area to be a limited production area within 15 days after the end of that period;

    * the Minister is taken to have refused, under subsection (1B), to make that declaration.

    * (1D) If, because the Minister does not declare a production area to be a limited production area within 15 days after the end of a period of 3 consecutive months, the Minister is taken, under subsection (1C), to have refused to make that declaration:

     * (a) that subsection does not prevent the Minister making such a declaration, in accordance with subsection (1B), at the end of any period of 3 consecutive months to which paragraph (1B)(a) applies (a **_subsequent period_**) that ends after that firstmentioned period; but

     * (b) if the Minister does not, within 15 days after the end of a subsequent period, make such a declaration, the Minister is again taken to have refused, under subsection (1B), to make such a declaration.

    * (1E) If:

     * (a) a particular production area has been declared to be a limited production area; and

     * (b) at any time after the declaration, the volume of excisable crude petroleum oil produced in that area and entered for home consumption exceeds the free volume of that oil in respect of that month, worked out in accordance with subsection (1G);

    * then: 

     * (c) the Minister must, by written notice given to the oil producer concerned, revoke the declaration; and

     * (d) the producer must give to the Minister, in respect of all excisable crude petroleum oil produced in that area and entered for home consumption after the making of the declaration, the information that, but for the making of the declaration, would have been required in respect of each transaction concerning that oil.

    * (1F) The information required to be given to the Minister under subsection (1E), or particular parts of that information, must be given to the Minister:

     * (a) unless the Minister otherwise indicates in the notice revoking the declaration--in the form specified for the purpose of subsection (2); and

     * (b) within a time or times specified by the Minister in that notice.

    * (1G) For the purposes of this section, the free volume of excisable crude petroleum oil that is entered for home consumption before the end of a month is the maximum volume of such oil that, if entered for home consumption before the end of that month would, under section 6B, 6C, 6CA or 6D of the _Excise Tariff Act 1921_, be a volume of oil to which no notional duty was applicable.

       * Note 1: Subsection (4) of section 6B, 6C or 6D of the _Excise Tariff Act 1921_ specifies, among other things, the minimum volume of oil to which notional duty becomes applicable. The effect of that subsection is modified by subsection (9) of each of those sections.

       * Note 2: Subsection 6CA(5) of the _Excise Tariff Act 1921_ specifies, among other things, the minimum volume of condensate to which notional duty becomes applicable. The effect of that subsection is modified by subsection 6CA(12) of that Act.

    * (2) The Minister shall, by notice published in the_ Gazette_, specify:

     * (a) the form in which the information is to be given; and

     * (b) the times within which the information is, or parts of the information are, to be given;

    * and the oil producer shall give the information accordingly.

      * Penalty: 

     * (a) in the case of a natural person--$2,000 or imprisonment for 12 months, or both; or

     * (b) in the case of a body corporate--$10,000.

##### 7  Minister etc. to determine VOLWARE prices

    * (1) A reference in this section to the volume weighted average of realised prices for a month and an oil producing region is a reference to the amount (expressed as an amount of Australian dollars, calculated to the nearest cent, per kilolitre) obtained by dividing the sum of the transaction prices in respect of quantities of excisable crude petroleum oil obtained from that region that are entered for home consumption during the month by the total volume of that oil.

    * (2) The Minister, or a person authorised by the Minister to exercise the Minister's powers under this section, shall, not later than one month after the end of each month occurring after the VOLWARE commencement date in relation to an oil producing region, determine a price in relation to that month and that region, to be known as the interim VOLWARE price for that month and that region, being an estimate by the Minister or authorised person, on the basis of the information available to him or her at the time (being information obtained pursuant to section 6 or otherwise), of the amount that will finally be determined to be the volume weighted average of realised prices for that month and that region.

    * (2A) Nothing in this section implies that the Minister, or a person authorised by the Minister to exercise the Minister's powers under this section, cannot determine an interim VOLWARE price for a month and an oil producing region at any time during the month concerned, whether or not there is available at that time any information concerning the prices for which excisable crude petroleum oil obtained from that region and entered for home consumption during that month has been sold, or is likely to be sold.

    * (3) The Minister, or a person authorised by the Minister to exercise the Minister's powers under this section, shall, not later than 6 months after the end of each month occurring after the VOLWARE commencement date in relation to an oil producing region, determine a price in relation to that month and that region, to be known as the final VOLWARE price for that month and that region, being the final determination by the Minister or authorised person of the volume weighted average of realised prices for that month and that region.

    * (3A) In spite of subsections (2) and (3), neither the Minister nor a person authorised by the Minister to exercise the Minister's powers under this section is required to determine an interim VOLWARE price, or a final VOLWARE price, in respect of an oil producing region and a month if, at all times during that month:

     * (a) if the region consists of a single production area--there is in force a declaration under subsection 6(1B) that that area is a limited production area; or

     * (b) if the region consists of 2 or more production areas--there are in force declarations under subsection 6(1B) that each of those areas is a limited production area.

    * (3B) Nothing in subsection (3A) affects the obligation of the Minister or of a person authorised by the Minister to exercise the Minister's powers under this section to determine an interim VOLWARE price, or a final VOLWARE price, in respect of an oil producing region and a month if a declaration under subsection 6(1B) relating to a production area in that region that was in force during that month is subsequently revoked.

    * (4) A determination of the final VOLWARE price for a month and an oil producing region shall not be made unless:

     * (a) the Minister or authorised person is satisfied that accurate and complete information concerning all of the transactions relevant to determining the price has become available to the Minister or authorised person; or

     * (b) 5 months and 20 days have passed since the end of that month and information that the Minister or authorised person is satisfied is accurate and complete concerning all of those transactions has not yet become available to the Minister or authorised person.

    * (5) Subject to subsection (6), the regulations may provide for:

     * (a) the manner in which transaction prices for quantities of excisable crude petroleum oil are to be calculated for the purposes of determining the volume weighted average of realised prices for a month and an oil producing region; and

     * (b) the manner in which the total volume of excisable crude petroleum oil is to be calculated for the purposes of such a determination.

    * (6) In determining the volume weighted average of realised prices for a month and an oil producing region, the Minister or authorised person may fix, for the purposes of the determination, the transaction price in respect of a quantity of excisable crude petroleum oil obtained from that region, being a price that he or she considers to be fair and reasonable, in substitution for a price set out in information given under section 6 if he or she considers that:

     * (a) the parties to any transaction concerning the oil were not dealing at arm's length in relation to that transaction; and

     * (b) the price set out is less than the amount that could reasonably be expected to be the price if the parties had been dealing at arm's length.

    * (7) Where the Minister or authorised person fixes a price for a transaction under subsection (6), he or she shall notify the oil producer in writing of the fixing of the price, giving the reasons for it.

    * (8) The fact that a transaction price for a particular transaction has not been fixed, under subsection (6), for the purpose of determining the interim VOLWARE price for a month and an oil producing region does not preclude the fixing of a transaction price for that transaction, under subsection (6), for the purposes of determining the final VOLWARE price for that month and that region.

    * (9) Subject to subsection (10), the Minister, or a person authorised by the Minister to exercise the Minister's powers under this section, may, at any time after a final VOLWARE price is determined under subsection (3), amend the determination if he or she is satisfied that the determination is incorrect because of:

     * (a) the making of an error in calculation or a mistake of fact; or

     * (b) the giving of information that was inaccurate or incomplete to the Minister or authorised person.

    * (10) The Minister or authorised person shall not, under subsection (9), amend a determination after the expiration of 3 years from the day on which the determination was made unless he or she is satisfied that the determination is incorrect because information given to the Minister or authorised person is inaccurate or incomplete due to the fraud or evasion of an oil producer.

    * (11) For the purposes of this Act (other than subsection (9) of this section) and the Acts referred to in section 3, where a determination has been amended under subsection (9), it has effect, as so amended, as a determination under subsection (3).

##### 8  Notification of prices

    * (1) The person making a determination under subsection 5(1) or 7(2), (3) or (9) shall cause written notices setting out the terms of the determination to be given to:

     * (a) the CEO; and

     * (b) each oil producer.

    * (2) A failure to comply with subsection (1) does not affect the validity of the determination.

### Part III--Miscellaneous

##### 9  Inspection of documents

    * (1) For the purpose of verifying information given to the Minister by an oil producer under section 6, a person authorised in writing by the Minister to exercise powers under this section:

     * (a) may, at all reasonable times, enter and remain on any land or premises on which documents that may be relevant to that information are situated;

    * (3) The oath to be taken or affirmation to be made by a person for the purposes of this section is an oath or affirmation that the information or answers that the person will give will be true.

    * (4) A person is not excused from furnishing information or producing a document, when required to do so under this section, on the grounds that furnishing the information or producing the document might tend to incriminate the person or make the person liable to a penalty.

    * (5) A person is not excused from answering a question, when required to do so under this section, on the grounds that the answer to the question might tend to incriminate the person or make the person liable to a penalty.
