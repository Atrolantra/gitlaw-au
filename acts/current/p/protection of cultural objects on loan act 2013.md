##### 3  Objects of this Act

    * (1) The main object of this Act is to encourage lenders to lend objects for temporary public exhibition in Australia under arrangements involving certain institutions.

     * (c) an action taken under a law of the Commonwealth, a State or a Territory; or

     * (d) the operation of such a law.

##### 4  Simplified outline

    * The following is a simplified outline of this Act: 

    * This Act deals with objects that are normally in a foreign country but are imported into Australia on loan for temporary public exhibition under arrangements made by certain institutions approved by the Minister.

    * While the objects are in Australia, Part 2 limits the circumstances in which lenders, exhibition facilitators, exhibiting institutions and people working for any of them can lose ownership or physical possession, custody or control of the objects because of:

       * (a) legal proceedings in Australian or foreign courts; or

       * (b) the exercise of certain powers (such as powers of seizure) under Commonwealth, State and Territory laws; or

       * (c) the operation of such laws.

    * Part 3 deals with the approval of institutions by the Minister, and the end of such approval.

    * Part 4 deals with miscellaneous matters.
