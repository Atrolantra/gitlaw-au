##### 19  Commissioner must give you notice of an assessment

    * (1) Except where the assessment is that you are entitled to the full amount of the grant or benefit claimed, the Commissioner must give you notice of an assessment as soon as practicable after the assessment is made. However, failing to do so does not affect the validity of the assessment.

    * (2) The Commissioner may give you the notice electronically if you transmitted the relevant claim to the Commissioner in an electronic format.

    * (2) The Commissioner must comply with the request if it is made within:

     * (a) 2 years after the end of the claim period; or

     * (b) such further period as the Commissioner allows.

##### 22  Production of assessment is conclusive evidence

    * If the Commissioner gives you a notice of assessment under this Part, the production of the notice is conclusive evidence:

     * (a) that the assessment was properly made; and

##### 23  Payment of grants or benefits

    * (1) If you are entitled to a grant or benefit in respect of a claim period:

    * (2) Grant or benefits are payable by the Commonwealth in the manner determined by the Commissioner.

##### 24  Recovery by setoff

    * If an entity is liable to pay a scheme debt, the scheme debt may be deducted from one or more grants or benefits that are payable to the entity, and if the scheme debt is so deducted, the grant or benefit is taken to have been paid in full to the entity.

##### 24A  Interest on underpaid grants or benefits

    * (1) Interest is payable by the Commissioner to a person in respect of an amount of grant or benefit that becomes payable to the person if:

     * (a) the amount relates to a grant or benefit for a claim period; and

     * (b) the amount is payable as a result of a decision to which this section applies (the **_review decision_**).

    * (2) The interest is to be calculated for the period (the **_interest period_**):

     * (a) starting on the day on which the original assessment in relation to the grant or benefit was made; and

     * (b) ending on the day on which the amount is paid or applied by the Commissioner.

    * (3) The following method statement shows how to work out the interest (which is calculated on a daily basis):

Calculating the interest payable

      * Step 1.	Work out the amount that is determined by the review decision to be the amount of the grant or benefit payable in relation to the claim period.

      * Step 2.	For each day in the interest period, work out the amount of the grant or benefit that had been paid or applied by the Commissioner on or before that day (reduced by any amounts repaid before that day by the person).

      * Step 3.	For each day in the interest period, subtract the amount worked out in step 2 from the amount worked out in step 1. If the result is negative, it is taken to be nil.

      * Step 4.	For each day in the interest period, multiply the amount worked out in step 3 by the base interest rate for the day (expressed as a daily rate).
