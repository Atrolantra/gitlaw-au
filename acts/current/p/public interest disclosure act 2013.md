    * The Federal Court or Federal Circuit Court may make orders for civil remedies (including compensation, injunctions and reinstatement of employment) if a reprisal is taken against a person because of a public interest disclosure (including a proposed or a suspected public interest disclosure).

    * It is an offence to disclose the identity of an individual who makes a public interest disclosure.

        * Note 1: Division 2 sets out the kinds of public interest disclosures.

        * Note 2: The principal officer of an agency has a duty to protect a public official who belongs to the agency from detriment that relates to a public interest disclosure made by the public official (see section 59).

##### Subdivision A--Immunity from liability

##### 10  Protection of disclosers

    * (1) If an individual makes a public interest disclosure:

     * (a) the individual is not subject to any civil, criminal or administrative liability (including disciplinary action) for making the public interest disclosure; and

     * (b) no contractual or other remedy may be enforced, and no contractual or other right may be exercised, against the individual on the basis of the public interest disclosure.

    * (2) Without limiting subsection (1):

     * (a) the individual has absolute privilege in proceedings for defamation in respect of the public interest disclosure; and

     * (b) a contract to which the individual is a party must not be terminated on the basis that the public interest disclosure constitutes a breach of the contract.

##### 11  Liability for false or misleading statements etc. unaffected

    * (1) Section 10 does not apply to civil, criminal or administrative liability (including disciplinary action) for knowingly making a statement that is false or misleading.

##### 11A  Designated publication restrictions

    * Section 10 does not apply to civil, criminal or administrative liability (including disciplinary action) for making a disclosure that contravenes a designated publication restriction if the person making the disclosure:

     * (a) knows that the disclosure contravenes the designated publication restriction; and

     * (b) does not have a reasonable excuse for that contravention.

##### 12  Discloser's liability for own conduct not affected

    * To avoid doubt, whether the individual's disclosure of his or her own conduct is a public interest disclosure does not affect his or her liability for the conduct.

##### Subdivision B--Protection from reprisals

##### 13  What constitutes taking a reprisal

    * (1) A person (the **_first person_**) **_takes a reprisal_** against another person (the **_second person_**) if:

     * (a) the first person causes (by act or omission) any detriment to the second person; and

     * (b) when the act or omission occurs, the first person believes or suspects that the second person or any other person made, may have made or proposes to make a public interest disclosure; and

    * (2) **_Detriment_** includes any disadvantage, including (without limitation) any of the following:

     * (a) dismissal of an employee;

     * (b) injury of an employee in his or her employment;

     * (c) alteration of an employee's position to his or her detriment;

    * (3) Despite subsection (1), a person does not take a reprisal against another person to the extent that the person takes administrative action that is reasonable to protect the other person from detriment.

##### 14  Compensation

    * (1) If the Federal Court or Federal Circuit Court is satisfied, on the application of a person (the **_applicant_**), that another person (the **_respondent_**) took or threatened to take, or is taking or threatening to take, a reprisal against the applicant, the Court may:

     * (a) in any case--make an order requiring the respondent to compensate the applicant for loss, damage or injury as a result of the reprisal or threat; or

     * (b) if the Court is satisfied that the respondent took or threatened to take, or is taking or threatening to take, the reprisal in connection with the respondent's position as an employee:

      * (i) make an order requiring the respondent to compensate the applicant for a part of loss, damage or injury as a result of the reprisal or threat, and make another order requiring the respondent's employer to compensate the applicant for a part of loss, damage or injury as a result of the reprisal or threat; or

      * (ii) make an order requiring the respondent and the respondent's employer jointly to compensate the applicant for loss, damage or injury as a result of the reprisal or threat; or

      * (iii) make an order requiring the respondent's employer to compensate the applicant for loss, damage or injury as a result of the reprisal or threat.

     * (c) any other order the Court thinks appropriate.

     *  	a disclosure within the government, to an authorised internal recipient or a supervisor, concerning suspected or probable illegal conduct or other wrongdoing (referred to as "disclosable conduct"); or

     *  	a disclosure to anybody, if an internal disclosure of the information has not been adequately dealt with, and if wider disclosure satisfies public interest requirements; or

     *  	a disclosure to anybody if there is substantial and imminent danger to health or safety; or

     *  	a disclosure to an Australian legal practitioner for purposes connected with the above matters.

    * However, there are limitations to take into account the need to protect intelligence information.

### Part 3--Investigations

#### Division 1--Allocating the handling of disclosures

##### 42  Simplified outline

    * The following is a simplified outline of this Division: 

    * If a disclosure is made to an authorised officer of an agency (either directly by the discloser or through a supervisor of the discloser), he or she allocates the handling of the disclosure to one or more agencies.

        * Note 1: In order for a disclosure to be an internal disclosure (one of the types of public interest disclosure), the disclosure must be made to an authorised officer or a supervisor.

        * Note 2: The way a disclosure is allocated (or a refusal to allocate a disclosure) may be the subject of a complaint to the Ombudsman under the _Ombudsman Act 1976_, or (in the case of an intelligence agency) to the IGIS under the _InspectorGeneral of Intelligence and Security Act 1986_.

##### 43  Authorised officer to allocate the handling of the disclosure

    * (1) If a person (the **_discloser_**) discloses information:

     * (a) to an authorised officer of an agency (the **_recipient agency_**); or

     * (b) to a supervisor of the discloser who then gives the information to the authorised officer;

    * the authorised officer must allocate the handling of the disclosure to one or more agencies (which may be or include the recipient agency).

        * Note 1: For the assistance that authorised officers must give to disclosers, see section 60.

        * Note 2: For the obligation of supervisors to give information to authorised officers, see section 60A.

    * (2) However, subsection (1) does not apply if the authorised officer is satisfied, on reasonable grounds, that there is no reasonable basis on which the disclosure could be considered to be an internal disclosure.

        * Note: The requirements for an internal disclosure are set out in item 1 of the table in subsection 26(1).

    * (3) In deciding the allocation, the authorised officer must have regard to:

     * (a) the principle that an agency should not handle the disclosure unless any of the following apply:

      * (i) in any case--some or all of the disclosable conduct with which the information may be concerned (**_suspected disclosable conduct_**) relates to the agency;

      * (ii) if the agency is the Ombudsman--some or all of the suspected disclosable conduct relates to an agency other than an intelligence agency or the IGIS;

      * (iii) if the agency is the IGIS--some or all of the suspected disclosable conduct relates to an intelligence agency;

#### Division 2--The obligation to investigate disclosures

##### 46  Simplified outline

    * The following is a simplified outline of this Division: 

    * The principal officer of the allocated agency must investigate the disclosure, and prepare a report, within a set time and in accordance with the requirements of this Division.

    * The principal officer may decide not to investigate in particular circumstances in which an investigation is unjustified, or if the agency is an investigative agency that can investigate without using this Act.

        * Note: The way a disclosure is investigated (or a refusal to investigate a disclosure) may be the subject of a complaint to the Ombudsman under the _Ombudsman Act 1976_, or (in the case of an intelligence agency) to the IGIS under the _InspectorGeneral of Intelligence and Security Act 1986_.

##### 47  Principal officer must investigate disclosures

    * (1) The principal officer of an agency must investigate a disclosure if the handling of the disclosure is allocated to the agency under Division 1.

    * (2) **_Investigate_**, in relation to a disclosure, means investigate (or reinvestigate) whether there are one or more instances of disclosable conduct. The disclosable conduct may relate to:

     * (a) the information that is disclosed; or

     * (b) information obtained in the course of the investigation.

    * (3) For the purposes of subsection (2), an investigation (or reinvestigation) may include consideration of whether a different investigation (or reinvestigation) should be conducted:

     * (a) by the agency; or

     * (b) by another body;

    * under another law of the Commonwealth.

    * (4) For the purposes of subsection (3), procedures established under a law of the Commonwealth (other than this Act) are taken to be a law of the Commonwealth.

##### 48  Discretion not to investigate

    * (1) Despite section 47, the principal officer of the agency may decide not to investigate the disclosure, or (if the investigation has started) not to investigate the disclosure further, if:

     * (a) the discloser is not, and has not been, a public official; or

     * (c) the information does not, to any extent, concern serious disclosable conduct; or

     * (d) the disclosure is frivolous or vexatious; or

     * (e) the information is the same, or substantially the same, as information the disclosure of which has been, or is being, investigated as a disclosure investigation; or

     * (f) the information concerns disclosable conduct that is the same, or substantially the same, as disclosable conduct that is being investigated under:

      * (i) a law of the Commonwealth other than this Act; or

      * (ii) the executive power of the Commonwealth;

     * and it would be inappropriate to conduct another investigation at the same time; or

     * (g) the information concerns disclosable conduct that is the same, or substantially the same, as disclosable conduct that has been investigated under:

      * (i) a law of the Commonwealth other than this Act; or

      * (ii) the executive power of the Commonwealth;

     * and the principal officer is reasonably satisfied that there are no further matters concerning the disclosure that warrant investigation; or

     * (h) the discloser has informed the principal officer of an agency that the discloser does not wish the investigation of the internal disclosure to be pursued, and the principal officer is reasonably satisfied that there are no matters concerning the disclosure that warrant investigation; or

     * (i) it is impracticable for the disclosure to be investigated:

      * (i) because the discloser's name and contact details have not been disclosed; or

      * (ii) because the discloser refuses or fails, or is unable, to give, for the purposes of the investigation, such information or assistance as the person who is or will be conducting the investigation asks the discloser to give; or

      * (iii) because of the age of the information.

    * (2) If the principal officer decides not to investigate the disclosure, or not to investigate it further, this Act does not, by implication, prevent the information from being investigated otherwise than under this Act.

    * (3) For the purposes of subparagraph (1)(f)(i) or (g)(i), procedures established under a law of the Commonwealth (other than this Act) are taken to be a law of the Commonwealth.

##### 49  Investigative agency using separate investigative powers

    * (1) Despite section 47, if the agency is an investigative agency that has a separate investigative power in relation to the disclosure, the principal officer of the agency may decide:

     * (a) to investigate the disclosure under that separate investigative power; and

     * (b) not to investigate the disclosure, or (if the investigation has started) not to investigate the disclosure further, under this Act.

    * (2) A **_separate investigative power_**, in relation to the disclosure, is a power that an investigative agency has, otherwise than under this Act, to investigate the disclosure.

    * (3) Despite paragraph (2)(a), the principal officer may delete from the reasons given to the discloser any reasons that would, if contained in a document, cause the document:

     * (a) to be exempt for the purposes of Part IV of the _Freedom of Information Act 1982_; or

     * (b) to have, or be required to have, a national security or other protective security classification; or

     * (c) to contain intelligence information.
