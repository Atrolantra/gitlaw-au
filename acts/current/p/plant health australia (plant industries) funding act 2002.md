     * (4) However, if the amount of the payment to PHA exceeds the Plant Industry Member's fundable contribution liability, subsection (3) only applies to so much of the payment as equals the amount of that liability.

      * (b) the research component of the PHA levy or charge so attached were an amount equal to the excess; and

      * (c) so much (if any) of the total PHA penalty receipts from the plant product for the year as exceeds the amount paid or payable to PHA under subsection 4(4) were an amount of penalty referred to in subparagraph 30(1)(a)(iii) of that Act that is attributable to the research component referred to in paragraph (b) of this subsection.

     * Investment

     * (2) If there is any money in an EPPR fund that is not immediately required for a payment under section 10C, PHA may invest the money (or part of it).
