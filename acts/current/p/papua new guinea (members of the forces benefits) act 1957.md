### An Act to make special provision for the granting of pensions and other benefits to certain indigenous Inhabitants of Papua New Guinea who served in the Defence Force during the War and their dependants, and for purposes connected therewith

1  Short title [_see_ Note 1]

    * This Act may be cited as the _Papua New Guinea (Members of the Forces Benefits) Act 1957_.

2  Commencement [_see_ Note 1]

##### 3  Interpretation

    * In this Act, unless the contrary intention appears:

**_member of the Forces_** means a male indigenous inhabitant of Papua New Guinea or of an island in the Pacific Ocean (other than an island forming part of the territory of a State) who served during the war in the Defence Force at a rate of pay less than the minimum rate of pay that was prescribed as payable to a male member of the Australian Military Forces and whose service has been terminated by discharge or death.

**_the Defence Force_** has the same meaning as in the _Defence Act 19031941_.

the Commonwealth is, subject to such conditions as are prescribed, liable to pay or grant to the member of the Forces and, subject to the regulations, to his dependants pension or compensation at such rates or of such amounts as are provided for in the regulations.

    * (2) Where:

     * (a) a member of the Forces is suffering from an incapacity or has died;

     * (c) the incapacity was contributed to in any material degree, or was aggravated, by the conditions of that service, or the death was contributed to in any material degree by those conditions;

the incapacity or death, as the case may be, shall be deemed to be attributable to that service.

    * (3) The Commonwealth is not liable under the preceding provisions of this section if the incapacity or death of the member of the Forces:

     * (a) was due to his serious default or wilful act;

     * (b) arose from intentionally selfinflicted injuries; or
