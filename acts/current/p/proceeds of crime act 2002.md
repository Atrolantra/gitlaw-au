## Chapter 2--The confiscation scheme

### Part 21A--Freezing orders

##### 15A  Simplified outline of this Part

    * A freezing order can be made against an account with a financial institution if: 

        * (a) there are grounds to suspect the account balance reflects proceeds or an instrument of certain offences; and

        * (b) a magistrate is satisfied that, unless the order is made, there is a risk that the balance of the account will be reduced so that a person will not be deprived of all or some of the proceeds or instrument.

#### Division 1--Making freezing orders

##### 15B  Making freezing orders

    * (1) A magistrate must order that a *financial institution not allow a withdrawal from an *account with the institution, except in the manner and circumstances specified in the order, if:

     * (a) an *authorised officer described in paragraph (a), (aa), (b) or (c) of the definition of **_authorised officer_** in section 338 applies for the order in accordance with Division 2; and

     * (b) there are reasonable grounds to suspect that the balance of the account:

      * (i) is *proceeds of an *indictable offence, a *foreign indictable offence or an *indictable offence of Commonwealth concern (whether or not the identity of the person who committed the offence is known); or

      * (ii) is wholly or partly an *instrument of a *serious offence; and

     * (c) the magistrate is satisfied that, unless an order is made under this section, there is a risk that the balance of the account will be reduced so that a person will not be deprived of all or some of such proceeds or such an instrument.

        *  	Note 1: Paragraphs (a), (aa), (b) and (c) of the definition of **_authorised officer _**in section 338 cover certain persons performing functions under this Act for the Australian Federal Police, the Australian Commission for Law Enforcement Integrity, the Australian Crime Commission and Customs.

        * Note 2: The balance of the account may be proceeds of an offence even though the balance is only partly derived from the offence: see section 329.

    * (2) An order made under subsection (1) covers the balance of the *account from time to time.

    * Order need not be based on commission of particular offence

    * (3) The reasonable grounds referred to in paragraph (1)(b), and the satisfaction referred to in paragraph (1)(c), need not be based on a finding as to the commission of a particular offence.

#### Division 2--How freezing orders are obtained

##### 15C  Affidavit supporting application made in person

    * If an *authorised officer applies in person to a magistrate for a *freezing order relating to an *account with a *financial institution, the application must be supported by an affidavit of an authorised officer described in paragraph (a), (aa), (b) or (c) of the definition of **_authorised officer_** in section 338:

     * (a) setting out sufficient information to identify the account (for example, the account number); and

     * (b) identifying the financial institution; and

     * (c) setting out the grounds to suspect that the balance of the account:

      * (i) is *proceeds of an *indictable offence, a *foreign indictable offence or an *indictable offence of Commonwealth concern; or

      * (ii) is wholly or partly an *instrument of a *serious offence; and

     * (d) setting out the grounds on which a person could be satisfied that, unless the order is made, there is a risk that the balance of the account will be reduced so that a person will not be deprived of all or some of such proceeds or of such an instrument.

        *  	Note: Paragraphs (a), (aa), (b) and (c) of the definition of **_authorised officer _**in section 338 cover certain persons performing functions under this Act for the Australian Federal Police, the Australian Commission for Law Enforcement Integrity, the Australian Crime Commission and Customs.

##### 15D  Applying for freezing orders by telephone or other electronic means

    * (1) An *authorised officer described in paragraph (a), (aa), (b) or (c) of the definition of **_authorised officer_** in section 338 may apply to a magistrate for a *freezing order by telephone, fax or other electronic means:

     * (a) in an urgent case; or

     * (b) if the delay that would occur if an application were made in person would frustrate the effectiveness of the order.

        *  	Note: Paragraphs (a), (aa), (b) and (c) of the definition of **_authorised officer _**in section 338 cover certain persons performing functions under this Act for the Australian Federal Police, the Australian Commission for Law Enforcement Integrity, the Australian Crime Commission and Customs.

    * (2) An application under subsection (1):

     * (a) must include all information that would be required in an ordinary application for a *freezing order and supporting affidavit; and

     * (b) if necessary, may be made before the affidavit is sworn.

    * (3) The magistrate may require:

     * (a) communication by voice to the extent that it is practicable in the circumstances; and

     * (b) any further information.

##### 15E  Making order by telephone etc.

    * (1) The magistrate may complete and sign the same form of *freezing order that would be made under section 15B if satisfied that:

     * (a) a freezing order should be issued urgently; or

     * (b) the delay that would occur if an application were made in person would frustrate the effectiveness of the order.

    * (2) If the magistrate makes the *freezing order, he or she must inform the applicant, by telephone, fax or other electronic means, of the terms of the order and the day on which and the time at which it was signed.

    * (3) The applicant must then:

     * (a) complete a form of *freezing order in terms substantially corresponding to those given by the magistrate; and

     * (b) state on the form:

      * (i) the name of the magistrate; and

      * (ii) the day on which the order was signed; and

      * (iii) the time at which the order was signed.

    * (4) The applicant must give the magistrate the form of *freezing order completed by the applicant by the end of:

     * (a) the second *working day after the magistrate makes the order; or

     * (b) the first working day after the magistrate makes the order, if it is served on the *financial institution concerned before the first working day after the magistrate makes the order.

    * (5) If, before the magistrate made the *freezing order, the applicant did not give the magistrate an affidavit supporting the application and meeting the description in section 15C, the applicant must do so by the time by which the applicant must give the magistrate the form of freezing order completed by the applicant.

    * (6) If the applicant does not comply with subsection (5), the *freezing order is taken never to have had effect.

    * (7) The magistrate must attach the form of *freezing order completed by the magistrate to the documents provided under subsection (4) and (if relevant) subsection (5).

##### 15F  Unsigned freezing orders in court proceedings

    * If: 

     * (a) it is material, in any proceedings, for a court to be satisfied that a *freezing order applied for under section 15D was duly made; and

     * (b) the form of freezing order signed by the magistrate is not produced in evidence;

    * the court must assume that the order was not duly made unless the contrary is proved.

##### 15FA  Prohibition of publication of evidence--proceedings for freezing orders

    * (1) If an *authorised officer applies to a magistrate for a *freezing order in accordance with this Division, the magistrate may make an order under subsection (2).

    * (2) If it appears to the magistrate to be necessary in order to prevent prejudice to the administration of justice, the magistrate may make an order prohibiting or restricting the publication of all or any of the following matters:

     * (a) if the application is made under section 15C (in person)--the matters referred to in that section that are contained in an affidavit made in support of the application;

     * (b) if the application is made under section 15D (by telephone or other electronic means)--the matters referred to in paragraph 15D(2)(a) that are contained, or that are to be contained, in an affidavit made in support of the application.

    * (3) The magistrate may make an order under subsection (2) at any time after the application is made and before it is determined.

    * (4) The power conferred by subsection (2) is in addition to, and is not taken to derogate from, any other power of the magistrate.

##### 15G  Offence for making false statements in applications

    * A person commits an offence if: 

     * (a) the person makes a statement (whether orally, in a document or in any other way); and

     * (c) the reasonable business expenses of that person;

     * (d) a specified debt incurred in good faith by that person.

    * (2) The court may only make an order under subsection (1) if:

     * (c) the person has disclosed all of his or her *interests in property, and his or her liabilities, in a statement on oath that has been filed in the court; and

     * (ca) the court is satisfied that the expense or debt does not, or will not, relate to legal costs that the person has incurred, or will incur, in connection with:

     * (c) a *foreign restraining order that is registered under the *Mutual Assistance Act;

    * is taken, for the purposes of paragraph (2)(d), not to be covered by the order if it would not be reasonably practicable for the *Official Trustee to take custody and control of the property.

##### 24A  Excluding property from or revoking restraining orders in certain cases when expenses are not allowed

    * (1) If:

     * (a) because of the operation of subsection 24(3), property that is covered by a *restraining order is taken, for the purposes of paragraph 24(2)(d), not to be covered by the order; and

     * (b) as a result, and for no other reason, the court refuses an application to make an order under subsection 24(1);

    * the court may: 

     * (c) exclude the property from the restraining order; or

     * (d) if the property is the only property covered by the restraining order--revoke the restraining order.

    * (2) The court must not exclude the property or revoke the order unless the court is satisfied that the property is needed to meet any one or more of the following:

    * However, the authority need not give notice to the applicant for the order under subsection 24(1).

#### Division 2--How restraining orders are obtained

##### 25  Proceeds of crime authority may apply for a restraining order

    * A *proceeds of crime authority may apply for a *restraining order.

##### 26  Notice of application

    * (1) Subject to subsection (4), the *responsible authority must:

     * (a) give written notice of an application for a *restraining order covering property to the owner of the property (if the owner is known); and

     * (b) include with the notice a copy of the application and any affidavit supporting the application.

    * (2) Subject to subsection (4), the *responsible authority must also:

     * (a) give written notice of an application for a *restraining order covering property to any other person the authority reasonably believes may have an *interest in the property; and

     * (b) include with the notice:

      * (i) a copy of the application; and

      * (ii) a further notice that the person may request that the authority give the person a copy of any affidavit supporting the application.

    * The authority must comply with any such request as soon as practicable.

    * (3) The court must not (unless subsection (4) applies) hear the application unless it is satisfied that the owner of the property to which the application relates has received reasonable notice of the application.

    * (4) The court must consider the application without notice having been given if the *responsible authority requests the court to do so.

    * (5) The court may, at any time before finally determining the application, direct the *responsible authority to give or publish notice of the application to a specified person or class of persons. The court may also specify the time and manner in which the notice is to be given or published.

    * (6) A person who claims an *interest in property may appear and adduce evidence at the hearing of the application.

##### 27  Proceeds of crime authority may choose under which section it applies for a restraining order

    * To avoid doubt, the fact that a *proceeds of crime authority may apply for a *restraining order under a section of Division 1 against property in relation to an offence does not prevent a proceeds of crime authority from applying for a *restraining order under a different section of Division 1 against that property in relation to that offence.

##### 28  Prejudice to investigations

    * A witness who is giving evidence relating to an application for a *restraining order is not required to answer a question or produce a document if the court is satisfied that the answer or document may prejudice the investigation of, or the prosecution of a person for, an offence.

##### 28A  Prohibition of publication of evidence--proceedings for restraining orders

    * (1) If a *proceeds of crime authority applies to a court for a *restraining order, the court may make an order under subsection (2).

    * (2) If it appears to the court to be necessary in order to prevent prejudice to the administration of justice, the court may make an order prohibiting or restricting the publication of all or any of the matters referred to in the following provisions (whichever is applicable) that are contained in an affidavit made in support of the application:

     * (a) subsection 17(3);

     * (b) subsection 18(3);

     * (c) paragraph 19(1)(e);

     * (d) subsection 20(3);

     * (e) subsection 20A(3).

    * (3) The court may make an order under subsection (2) at any time after the application is made and before it is determined.

    * (4) The power conferred by subsection (2) is in addition to, and is not taken to derogate from, any other power of the court.

#### Division 3--Excluding property from restraining orders

        * Note: In addition to this Division, section 44 provides for property to be excluded from a restraining order on the giving of satisfactory security.

##### 29  Excluding property from certain restraining orders

    * (1) The court to which an application for a *restraining order under section 17, 18 or 19 was made must, when the order is made or at a later time, exclude a specified *interest in property from the order if:

     * (a) an application is made under section 30 or 31; and

     * (b) the court is satisfied that the relevant reason under subsection (2) or (3) for excluding the interest from the order exists.

        * Note: Section 32 may prevent the court from hearing the application until the responsible authority has had a reasonable opportunity to conduct an examination of the applicant.

    * (2) The reasons for excluding a specified *interest in property from a *restraining order are:

     * (a) for a restraining order under section 17 if the offence, or any of the offences, to which the order relates is a *serious offence--the interest is neither *proceeds nor an *instrument of *unlawful activity; or

     * (b) for a restraining order under section 17 if paragraph (a) does not apply--the interest is neither proceeds nor an instrument of the offence, or any offence, to which the order relates; or

     * (c) for a restraining order under section 18--the interest is neither:

      * (i) in any case--proceeds of unlawful activity; nor

      * (ii) if an offence to which the order relates is a serious offence--an *instrument of any serious offence; or

     * (d) for a restraining order under section 19--the interest is neither:

      * (i) in any case--proceeds of an *indictable offence, a *foreign indictable offence or an *indictable offence of Commonwealth concern; nor

      * (ii) if an offence to which the order relates is a serious offence--an *instrument of any serious offence.

        * Note: One of the circumstances in which property ceases to be proceeds of an offence or unlawful activity involves acquisition of the property by an innocent third party for sufficient consideration: see paragraph 330(4)(a).

    * (3) If the offence, or each offence, to which a *restraining order relates is a *serious offence that is an offence against section 15, 24, 29 or 31 of the _Financial Transaction Reports Act 1988 _or section 53, 59, 136, 137, 139, 140, 141, 142 or 143 of the _AntiMoney Laundering and CounterTerrorism Financing Act 2006_, a further reason for excluding a specified *interest in property from the order is that each of the following requirements is met:

     * (a) there are no reasonable grounds to suspect that the interest is *proceeds of the offence, or any of the offences;

     * (b) there is a *suspect in relation to the order, but he or she has not been convicted of, or charged with, the offence, or any of the offences;

     * (c) the conduct in question was not for the purpose of, in preparation for, or in contemplation of, any other *indictable offence, any *State indictable offence or any *foreign indictable offence;

     * (d) the interest could not have been covered by a restraining order if none of the offences had been serious offences.

    * (4) However, the court must not exclude a specified *interest in property from a *restraining order under section 17 or 18 unless it is also satisfied that neither a *pecuniary penalty order nor a *literary proceeds order could be made against:

     * (a) the person who has the interest; or

     * (b) if the interest is not held by the *suspect but is under his or her *effective control--the suspect.

##### 29A  Excluding property from a restraining order made under section 20A

    * The court to which an application for a *restraining order under section 20A was made must, when the order is made or at a later time, exclude a specified *interest in property from the order if:

     * (a) an application is made under section 30 or 31; and

     * (b) the court is satisfied that the interest is held by a person other than the *suspect and is not subject to the *effective control of the suspect.

        * Note: Section 32 may prevent the court from hearing the application until the responsible authority has had a reasonable opportunity to conduct examinations in relation to the restraining order.

##### 30  Application to exclude property from a restraining order before restraining order has been made

    * (1) A person may apply for an order under section 29 or 29A if a *restraining order that could cover property in which the person claims an *interest has been applied for, but is yet to be made.

    * (2) The person must give written notice to the *responsible authority of both the application and the grounds on which the exclusion is sought.

    * (3) The *responsible authority may appear and adduce evidence at the hearing of the application.

    * (4) The *responsible authority must give the person notice of any grounds on which it proposes to contest the application.

##### 31  Application to exclude property from a restraining order after restraining order has been made

    * (1) A person may apply for an order under section 29 or 29A if a *restraining order that covers property in which the person claims an *interest has been made.

    * (1A) An application under subsection (1):

     * (a) must be made to the court that made the *restraining order; and

     * (b) may be made at any time after the restraining order is made.

    * (2) However, unless the court gives leave, the person cannot apply if he or she:

     * (a) was notified of the application for the *restraining order, but did not appear at the hearing of that application; or

     * (b) appeared at the hearing of that application.

    * (3) The court may give the person leave to apply if the court is satisfied that:

     * (a) if paragraph (2)(a) applies--the person had a good reason for not appearing; or

     * (b) if paragraph (2)(b) applies--the person now has evidence relevant to the person's application that was not available to the person at the time of the hearing; or

     * (c) in either case--there are other special grounds for granting the leave.

    * (4) The person must give written notice to the *responsible authority of both the application and the grounds on which the exclusion is sought.

    * (5) The *responsible authority may appear and adduce evidence at the hearing of the application.

    * (6) The *responsible authority must give the person notice of any grounds on which it proposes to contest the application. However, the authority need not do so until it has had a reasonable opportunity to conduct *examinations in relation to the application.

##### 32  Application not to be heard unless responsible authority has had reasonable opportunity to conduct an examination

    * The court must not hear an application to exclude specified property from the *restraining order if:

     * (a) the restraining order is in force; and

     * (b) the *responsible authority has not been given a reasonable opportunity to conduct *examinations in relation to the application.

#### Division 4--Giving effect to restraining orders

##### 33  Notice of a restraining order

    * (1) If a court makes a *restraining order covering property that a person owns, the *responsible authority must give written notice of the order to the person.

        * Note: A person who was not notified of the application for a restraining order may apply to revoke the restraining order within 28 days of being notified of the order: see section 42.

    * (2) The *responsible authority must include a copy of the application and any affidavit supporting the application with the notice (if those documents have not already been given to the person).

    * (3) However, the court may order that:

     * (a) all or part of the application or affidavit is not to be given to the person; or

     * (b) the *responsible authority delay giving the notice (and the documents included with the notice) for a specified period;

    * if the authority requests the court to do so and the court considers that this is appropriate in order to protect the integrity of any investigation or prosecution.

    * (4) If the court orders the *responsible authority to delay giving the notice (and the documents included with the notice) for a specified period, the authority must give the notice as soon as practicable after the end of that period.

##### 34  Registering restraining orders

    * (1) A *registration authority that keeps a register of property of a particular kind may record in the register particulars of a *restraining order covering property of that kind.

    * (2) The *registration authority can only do so on the application of the *responsible authority for the *restraining order.

    * (3) Each person who subsequently deals with the property:

     * (a) is taken not to be acting in good faith for the purposes of section 36; and

     * (b) is taken to have notice of the *restraining order for the purposes of section 37.

##### 35  Notifying registration authorities of exclusions from or variations to restraining orders

    * (1) If the *responsible authority for a *restraining order covering particular property has previously applied to a *registration authority under section 34 for the recording in a register of particulars of the order, the responsible authority must notify the registration authority if:

     * (a) the property is no longer covered by the order because it is excluded from the order under section 29 or 29A or because the property covered by the order is varied under section 39; or

     * (b) a condition to which a restraining order is subject is varied under section 39.

    * (2) The notice must be given within a reasonable time after the order under section 39 is made.

##### 36  Court may set aside a disposition contravening a restraining order

    * (1) The *responsible authority may apply to the court to set aside a disposition or dealing with property that contravenes a *restraining order if that disposition or dealing was:

##### 39A  Privilege against self incrimination etc. does not apply

    * (1) A person is not excused from giving a sworn statement under paragraph 39(1)(ca), (d) or (da) on the grounds that to do so would tend to incriminate the person or expose the person to a penalty.

### Part 22--Forfeiture orders

##### 46  Simplified outline of this Part

    * Forfeiture orders can be made, forfeiting property to the Commonwealth, if certain offences have been committed. (It is not always a requirement that a person has been convicted of such an offence.)

    * Orders are made on the application of a proceeds of crime authority (the Commissioner of the Australian Federal Police or the DPP). Other orders can be made to reduce the effect of forfeiture orders on grounds such as hardship to the person's dependants.

        * Note: If a person is convicted of a serious offence, forfeiture can be automatic under Part 23. There is no need for a forfeiture order.

#### Division 1--Making forfeiture orders

##### 47  Forfeiture orders--conduct constituting serious offences

    * (1) A court with *proceeds jurisdiction must make an order that property specified in the order is forfeited to the Commonwealth if:

     * (a) the *responsible authority for a *restraining order under section 18 that covers the property applies for an order under this subsection; and

     * (b) the restraining order has been in force for at least 6 months; and

     * (c) the court is satisfied that a person whose conduct or suspected conduct formed the basis of the restraining order engaged in conduct constituting one or more *serious offences.

        * Note: The order can be made before the end of the period of 6 months referred to in paragraph (1)(b) if it is made as a consent order: see section 316.

    * (2) A finding of the court for the purposes of paragraph (1)(c) need not be based on a finding as to the commission of a particular offence, and can be based on a finding that some *serious offence or other was committed.

    * (3) The raising of a doubt as to whether a person engaged in conduct constituting a *serious offence is not of itself sufficient to avoid a finding by the court under paragraph (1)(c).

    * Refusal to make a forfeiture order

    * (4) Despite subsection (1), the court may refuse to make an order under that subsection relating to property that the court is satisfied:

     * (a) is an *instrument of a *serious offence other than a *terrorism offence; and

     * (b) is not *proceeds of an offence;

    * if the court is satisfied that it is not in the public interest to make the order.

##### 48  Forfeiture orders--convictions for indictable offences

    * (1) A court with *proceeds jurisdiction must make an order that property specified in the order is forfeited to the Commonwealth if:

     * (a) a *proceeds of crime authority applies for the order; and

     * (b) a person has been convicted of one or more *indictable offences; and

     * (c) the court is satisfied that the property to be specified in the order is *proceeds of one or more of the offences.

    * (2) A court with *proceeds jurisdiction may make an order that property specified in the order is forfeited to the Commonwealth if:

     * (a) a *proceeds of crime authority applies for the order; and

     * (b) a person has been convicted of one or more *indictable offences; and

     * (c) subsection (1) does not apply; and

     * (d) the court is satisfied that the property to be specified in the order is an *instrument of one or more of the offences.

    * (3) In considering whether it is appropriate to make an order under subsection (2) in respect of particular property, the court may have regard to:

     * (a) any hardship that may reasonably be expected to be caused to any person by the operation of the order; and

     * (b) the use that is ordinarily made, or was intended to be made, of the property to be specified in the order; and

     * (c) the gravity of the offence or offences concerned.

        * Note: Section 52 limits the court's power to make a forfeiture order if one or more of the person's convictions were due to the person absconding.

##### 49  Forfeiture orders--property suspected of being proceeds of indictable offences etc.

    * (1) A court with *proceeds jurisdiction must make an order that property specified in the order is forfeited to the Commonwealth if:

     * (a) the *responsible authority for a *restraining order under section 19 that covers the property applies for an order under this subsection; and

     * (b) the restraining order has been in force for at least 6 months; and

     * (c) the court is satisfied that one or more of the following applies:

      * (i) the property is *proceeds of one or more *indictable offences;

      * (ii) the property is proceeds of one or more *foreign indictable offences;

      * (iii) the property is proceeds of one or more *indictable offences of Commonwealth concern;

      * (iv) the property is an instrument of one or more *serious offences; and

     * (e) the court is satisfied that the authority has taken reasonable steps to identify and notify persons with an *interest in the property.

    * (2) A finding of the court for the purposes of paragraph (1)(c):

     * (a) need not be based on a finding that a particular person committed any offence; and

     * (b) need not be based on a finding as to the commission of a particular offence, and can be based on a finding that some offence or other of a kind referred to in paragraph (1)(c) was committed.

    * (3) Paragraph (1)(c) does not apply if the court is satisfied that:

     * (a) no application has been made under Division 3 of Part 21 for the property to be excluded from the *restraining order; or

     * (b) any such application that has been made has been withdrawn.

    * Refusal to make a forfeiture order

    * (4) Despite subsection (1), the court may refuse to make an order under that subsection relating to property that the court is satisfied:

     * (a) is an *instrument of a *serious offence other than a *terrorism offence; and

     * (b) is not *proceeds of an offence;

    * if the court is satisfied that it is not in the public interest to make the order.

##### 50  Existence of other confiscation orders

    * The court's power to make a *forfeiture order in relation to an offence is not affected by the existence of another *confiscation order in relation to that offence.

        * Note: There are restrictions on a proceeds of crime authority applying for forfeiture orders if previous applications for forfeiture etc. have already been made: see section 60.

##### 51  Acquittals do not affect forfeiture orders under section 47 or 49

    * The fact that a person has been acquitted of an offence with which the person has been charged does not affect the court's power to make a *forfeiture order under section 47 or 49 in relation to the offence.

##### 52  Making of forfeiture order if person has absconded

    * If, because of paragraph 331(1)(d), a person is taken to have been convicted of an *indictable offence, a court must not make a *forfeiture order relating to the person's conviction unless:

     * (a) the court is satisfied, on the balance of probabilities, that the person has *absconded; and

     * (b) either:

      * (i) the person has been committed for trial for the offence; or

      * (ii) the court is satisfied, having regard to all the evidence before the court, that a reasonable jury, properly instructed, could lawfully find the person guilty of the offence.

##### 53  Jurisdictional issues concerning forfeiture orders

    * (1) A court cannot make a *forfeiture order in respect of property if the court does not have jurisdiction with respect to the recovery of property of that kind.

    * (2) A court may make a *forfeiture order in respect of property even though, apart from section 314, the court does not have jurisdiction with respect to property whose value equals the value of that property.

    * (3) A reference in subsection (1) to a court having jurisdiction with respect to the recovery of property includes a reference to the court having jurisdiction, under a *corresponding law, to make an *interstate forfeiture order in respect of property.

#### Division 2--Other relevant matters when a court is considering whether to make forfeiture orders

##### 54  Presumption in certain cases that property is an instrument of an offence

    * If: 

     * (a) a *proceeds of crime authority applies for:

      * (i) a *forfeiture order under section 47 or 49 against particular property in relation to a person's commission of a *serious offence; or

      * (ii) a forfeiture order under section 48 against particular property in relation to a person's conviction of an *indictable offence; and

     * (b) evidence is given, at the hearing of the application, that the property was in the person's possession at the time of, or immediately after, the person committed the offence;

    * then: 

     * (c) if no evidence is given that tends to show that the property was not used in, or in connection with, the commission of the offence--the court must presume that the property was used in, or in connection with, the commission of the offence; or

     * (d) in any other case--the court must not make a forfeiture order against the property unless it is satisfied that the property was used or intended to be used in, or in connection with, the commission of the offence.

##### 55  Forfeiture orders can extend to other interests in property

    * (1) In specifying an *interest in property in a *forfeiture order, the court may also specify other interests in the property (regardless of whose they are) if:

     * (a) the amount received from disposing of the combined interests would be likely to be greater than the amount received from disposing of each of the interests separately; or

     * (b) disposing of the interests separately would be impracticable or significantly more difficult than disposing of the combined interests.

    * (2) If the court so specifies other *interests in the *forfeiture order, the court may make such ancillary orders as it thinks fit for the protection of a person having one or more of those other interests. These ancillary orders may include:

     * (a) an order directing the Commonwealth to pay the person a specified amount as the value of the person's interest in the property; or

     * (b) an order directing that specified other interests in the property be transferred to the person.

    * (3) In deciding whether to make an ancillary order, the court must have regard to:

     * (a) the nature, extent and value of the person's *interest in the property concerned; and

     * (b) if the court is aware that any other person claims an interest in the property--the nature, extent and value of the interest claimed; and

     * (c) any other matter that the court considers relevant.

    * (4) For the purposes of an order described in paragraph (2)(a), an amount may be specified wholly or partly by reference to a specified proportion of the difference between:

     * (a) the amount received from disposing of the combined interests specified in the *forfeiture order; and

     * (b) the sum of any payments of the kind referred to in paragraph 70(1)(b) in connection with the forfeiture order.

##### 56  Forfeiture orders must specify the value of forfeited property

    * The court must specify, in any *forfeiture order it makes, the amount it considers to be the value, at the time the order is made, of the property (other than money) specified in the order.

##### 57  A person may buy back forfeited property

    * A court that makes a *forfeiture order against property may, if it is satisfied that:

     * (a) it would not be contrary to the public interest for a person's *interest in the property to be transferred to the person; and

     * (b) there is no other reason why the person's interest in the property should not be transferred to that person;

    * by order: 

     * (c) declare the nature, extent and value (as at the time when the order is made) of the interest; and

     * (d) declare that the interest may be excluded, under section 89, from the operation of the forfeiture order.

##### 58  The court may also make supporting directions

    * (1) If a court makes a *forfeiture order, the court has power to give all directions that are necessary or convenient for giving effect to the order.

    * (2) This includes, for a *forfeiture order specifying *registrable property, a direction to an officer of the court to do anything necessary and reasonable to obtain possession of any document necessary for the transfer of the property.

#### Division 3--How forfeiture orders are obtained

##### 59  Proceeds of crime authority may apply for a forfeiture order

    * (1) A *proceeds of crime authority may apply for a *forfeiture order.

    * (2) If the application relates to a person's conviction of an *indictable offence, the application must be made before the end of the period of 6 months after the *conviction day.

##### 60  Additional application for a forfeiture order

    * (1) A *proceeds of crime authority cannot, unless the court gives leave, apply for a *forfeiture order under a section of Division 1 in relation to an offence if:

     * (a) an application has previously been made:

      * (i) under this Division for an order under the same section of Division 1; or

      * (ii) under another law of the Commonwealth (other than Division 1); or

      * (iii) under a law of a *nongoverning ;

     * for the forfeiture or condemnation of the property in relation to the offence; and

     * (b) the application has been finally determined on the merits.

    * (2) The court must not give leave unless it is satisfied that:

     * (a) the property to which the new application relates was identified only after the first application was determined; or

     * (b) necessary evidence became available only after the first application was determined; or

     * (c) it is in the interests of justice to grant the leave.

    * (3) To avoid doubt:

     * (a) a *proceeds of crime authority may apply for a *forfeiture order under a section of Division 1 against property in relation to an offence even though an application has previously been made under a different section of Division 1 for forfeiture of that property in relation to that offence; and

     * (b) a proceeds of crime authority may apply for a forfeiture order against property in relation to an offence even though an application has previously been made for a *pecuniary penalty order or a *literary proceeds order in relation to that offence.

##### 61  Notice of application

    * (1) The *responsible authority must give written notice of an application for a *forfeiture order to:

     * (a) if the order is sought relating to a person's conviction of an offence--the person; and

     * (b) any person who claims an *interest in property covered by the application; and

     * (c) any person whom the authority reasonably believes may have an interest in that property.

    * (2) The court hearing the application may, at any time before finally determining the application, direct the *responsible authority to give or publish notice of the application to a specified person or class of persons. The court may also specify the time and manner in which the notice is to be given or published.

##### 62  Amending an application

    * (1) The court hearing an application for a *forfeiture order may amend the application:

     * (a) on application by the *responsible authority; or

     * (b) with the consent of the authority.

    * (2) However, the court must not amend the application to include additional property in the application unless:

     * (a) the court is satisfied that:

      * (i) the property was not reasonably capable of identification when the application was originally made; or

      * (ii) necessary evidence became available only after the application was originally made; or

     * (b) the *forfeiture order applied for is an order under section 47 or 49 and the court is satisfied that:

      * (i) including the additional property in the application for the order might have prejudiced the investigation of, or the prosecution of a person for, an offence; or

      * (ii) it is for any other reason appropriate to grant the application to amend.

    * (3) On applying for an amendment to include additional property in the application, the *responsible authority must give written notice of the application to amend to any person whom the authority reasonably believes may have an *interest in that additional property.

    * (4) If the *forfeiture order applied for is an order under section 48, any person who claims an *interest in that additional property may appear and adduce evidence at the hearing of the application to amend.

##### 63  Court may dispense with notice requirements if person has absconded

    * The court to which an application for a *forfeiture order is made in relation to an offence may, on application by the *responsible authority, dispense with the requirements to give notice to a person under subsections 61(1) and 62(3) if the court is satisfied that the person has *absconded in connection with the offence.

##### 64  Procedure on application

    * (1) Any person who claims an *interest in property covered by an application for a *forfeiture order may appear and adduce evidence at the hearing of the application.

    * (2) The court may, in determining the application, have regard to:

     * (a) the transcript of any proceeding against the person for an offence that constitutes *unlawful activity; and

     * (b) the evidence given in any such proceeding.

    * (3) The court may still make a *forfeiture order if a person entitled to be given notice of the relevant application fails to appear at the hearing of the application.

##### 65  Applications to courts before which persons are convicted

    * If an application for a *forfeiture order is made to a court before which a person was convicted of an *indictable offence:

     * (a) the application may be dealt with by the court; and

     * (b) any power in relation to the relevant order may be exercised by the court;

    * whether or not the court is constituted in the same way in which it was constituted when the person was convicted of the indictable offence.

#### Division 4--Effect of forfeiture orders

##### 66  What property is forfeited and when--general rule

    * Property specified in a *forfeiture order vests absolutely in the Commonwealth at the time the order is made.

##### 67  First exception--registrable property

    * (1) Despite section 66, if property specified in the *forfeiture order is *registrable property:

     * (a) that property vests in equity in the Commonwealth but does not vest in the Commonwealth at law until the applicable registration requirements have been complied with; and

     * (b) the *responsible authority has power, on behalf of the Commonwealth, to do anything necessary or convenient to give notice of, or otherwise protect, the Commonwealth's equitable interest in that property; and

     * (c) the Commonwealth is entitled to be registered as the owner of that property; and

     * (d) the *Official Trustee has power, on behalf of the Commonwealth, to do, or authorise the doing of, anything necessary or convenient to obtain the registration of the Commonwealth as the owner.

    * (2) Any action by the *responsible authority under paragraph (1)(b) is not a dealing for the purposes of subsection 69(1).

    * (3) The *Official Trustee's powers under paragraph (1)(d) include executing any instrument required to be executed by a person transferring an *interest in property of that kind.

##### 68  Second exception--if a joint owner dies before the order was made

    * (1) Despite section 66, if a person:

     * (a) was, immediately before his or her death, the joint owner of property specified in the *forfeiture order; but

     * (b) died before the order was made, but:

      * (i) after the *responsible authority applied for the order; or

      * (ii) while a *restraining order covering the property was in force;

    * that property is taken to have vested in the Commonwealth immediately before the person's death.

    * (2) Any such *restraining order is also taken to have continued to apply to the property as if the person had not died.

##### 69  When can the Commonwealth begin dealing with forfeited property?

    * (1) The Commonwealth, and persons acting on its behalf, can only dispose of, or otherwise deal with, property specified in a *forfeiture order after, and only if the order is still in force at, the later of the following times:

     * (a) when:

      * (i) if the period provided for lodging an appeal against the order has ended without such an appeal having been lodged--that period ends; or

      * (ii) if an appeal against the order has been lodged--the appeal lapses or is finally determined;

     * (b) if the order was made in relation to a person's conviction of an offence--when:

      * (i) if the period provided for lodging an appeal against the conviction has ended without such an appeal having been lodged--that period ends; or

      * (ii) if an appeal against the conviction has been lodged--the appeal lapses or is finally determined.

    * (2) However, such disposals and dealings may occur earlier with the leave of the court and in accordance with any directions of the court.

    * (3) For the purposes of paragraph (1)(b):

     * (a) if the person is to be taken to have been convicted of the offence because of paragraph 331(1)(b)--an appeal against the finding of the person guilty of the offence is taken to be an appeal against the conviction; and

     * (b) if the person is to be taken to have been convicted of the offence because of paragraph 331(1)(c)--an appeal against the person's conviction of the other offence referred to in that paragraph is taken to be an appeal against the conviction.

##### 70  How must the Commonwealth deal with forfeited property?

    * (1) If the *forfeiture order is still in force at the later time mentioned in subsection 69(1), the *Official Trustee must, on the Commonwealth's behalf and as soon as practicable:

     * (a) dispose of any property specified in the order that is not money; and

     * (b) apply:

      * (i) any amounts received from that disposal; and

      * (ii) any property specified in the order that is money;

     * to payment of its remuneration and other costs, charges and expenses of the kind referred to in subsection 288(1) payable to or incurred by it in connection with the disposal and with the *restraining order that covered the property; and

     * (c) credit the remainder of the money and amounts received to the *Confiscated Assets Account as required by section 296.

    * (2) However, if the *Official Trustee is required to deal with property specified in a *forfeiture order but has not yet begun:

     * (a) the Minister; or

     * (b) a *senior Departmental officer authorised by the Minister for the purposes of this subsection;

    * may direct that the property be alternatively disposed of, or otherwise dealt with, as specified in the direction.

    * (3) Such a direction could be that property is to be disposed of in accordance with the provisions of a specified law.

        * Note: The quashing of a conviction of an offence relating to a forfeiture may prevent things being done under this section: see section 86.

##### 71  Dealings with forfeited property

    * A person is guilty of an offence if: 

     * (a) the person knows that a *forfeiture order has been made in respect of *registrable property; and

     * (b) the person disposes of, or otherwise deals with, the property before the Commonwealth's interest has been registered on the appropriate register; and

     * (c) the forfeiture order has not been discharged.

      * Penalty: Imprisonment for 5 years or 300 penalty units, or both.

##### 72  Relieving certain dependants from hardship

    * (1) The court making a *forfeiture order specifying a *person's property must make another order directing the Commonwealth to pay a specified amount to a *dependant of the person if:

     * (a) the forfeiture order is not to be made under section 48; and

     * (b) the court is satisfied that:

      * (i) the forfeiture order would cause hardship to the dependant; and

      * (ii) the specified amount would relieve that hardship; and

      * (iii) if the dependant is aged at least 18 years--the dependant had no knowledge of the person's conduct that is the subject of the forfeiture order.

    * (2) The specified amount must not exceed the difference between:

     * (a) what the court considers is likely to be the amount received from disposing of the *person's property under the *forfeiture order; and

     * (b) what the court considers is likely to be the sum of any payments of the kind referred to in paragraph 70(1)(b) in connection with the forfeiture order.

    * (3) An order under this section may relate to more than one of the person's *dependants.

##### Subdivision B--Excluding property from a forfeiture order

##### 73  Making exclusion orders

    * (1) A court that made a *forfeiture order, or that is hearing, or is to hear, an application (a **_forfeiture application_**) for a forfeiture order, must make an order excluding a specified *interest in property from forfeiture (an **_exclusion order_**) if:

     * (a) a person applies for the exclusion order; and

     * (b) the forfeiture order, or the forfeiture application, specifies property in which the applicant has an interest; and

     * (c) if the forfeiture order was (or the forfeiture order applied for would be) made under section 47 or 49--the court is satisfied that the applicant's interest in the property is neither of the following:

      * (i) *proceeds of *unlawful activity;

      * (ii) if an offence on which the order was (or would be) based is a *serious offence--an instrument of any serious offence; and

     * (d) if the forfeiture order was (or the forfeiture order applied for would be) made under section 48--the court is satisfied that the applicant's interest in the property is neither proceeds nor an instrument of any of the offences to which the forfeiture order or forfeiture application relates.

    * (2) An *exclusion order must:

     * (a) specify the nature, extent and value (at the time of making the order) of the *interest concerned; and

     * (b) direct that the interest be excluded from the operation of the relevant *forfeiture order; and

     * (c) if the interest has vested (in law or equity) in the Commonwealth under this Part and is yet to be disposed of--direct the Commonwealth to transfer the interest to the applicant; and

     * (d) if the interest has vested (in law or equity) in the Commonwealth under this Part and has been disposed of--direct the Commonwealth to pay the applicant an amount equal to the value specified under paragraph (a).

##### 74  Applying for exclusion orders

     * (b) the evidence given in any such proceeding.

##### 84  Court may confirm forfeiture order

    * (1) The court may confirm the *forfeiture order if the court is satisfied that:

     * (a) it could have made a forfeiture order under section 47 in relation to the offence in relation to which the person's conviction was *quashed if, when the *responsible authority applied for an order under section 48, it had instead applied for an order under section 47; or

### Part 23--Forfeiture on conviction of a serious offence

##### 91  Simplified outline of this Part

    * There are cases in which compensation is payable by the Commonwealth.

    * There are cases in which forfeited property can be recovered from the Commonwealth.

        * Note: Property can be forfeited in relation to a serious offence, without a conviction, under a forfeiture order under Part 22.

#### Division 1--Forfeiture on conviction of a serious offence

##### 92  Forfeiting restrained property without a forfeiture order if a person has been convicted of a serious offence

    * (1) Property is forfeited to the Commonwealth at the end of the period applying under subsection (3) if:

     * (a) a person is convicted of a *serious offence; and

     * (b) either:

      * (i) at the end of that period, the property is covered by a *restraining order under section 17 or 18 against the person that relates to the offence; or

     * (c) the property is not subject to an order under section 94 excluding the property from forfeiture under this Part.

    * (2) It does not matter whether:

     * (a) the *restraining order was made before or after the person's conviction of the *serious offence; or

     * (b) immediately before forfeiture, the property is the *person's property or another person's property.

    * (3) The period at the end of which the property is forfeited is:

     * (a) the 6 month period starting on the *conviction day; or

     * (b) if an *extension order is in force at the end of that period--the extended period relating to that extension order.

    * (4) This section does not apply if the person is taken to have been convicted of the offence because the person *absconded in connection with the offence.

    * (5) A *restraining order in relation to a *related offence with which the person has been charged, or is proposed to be charged, is taken, for the purposes of this section, to be a restraining order in relation to the offence of which the person was convicted.

    * (6) If:

     * (a) under section 44, a *restraining order that covered particular property is revoked, or particular property is excluded from a restraining order; and

     * (b) the security referred to in paragraph 44(1)(e), or the undertaking referred to in paragraph 44(2)(e), in connection with the revocation or exclusion is still in force;

    * the property is taken, for the purposes of this section, to be covered by the restraining order.

##### 92A  Notice of date of forfeiture under this Part, etc.

    * (1) The *responsible authority for the *restraining order referred to in paragraph 92(1)(b) must, before property is forfeited under this Part, take reasonable steps to give any person who has or claims, or whom the authority reasonably believes may have, an *interest in the property a written notice stating:

     * (a) the date on which the property will be forfeited under this Part unless it is excluded from forfeiture; and

     * (b) the effect of section 93 (which deals with *extension orders); and

     * (c) that the person may be able to apply for an order under one of the following sections in relation to the property:

      * (i) section 29 (which deals with the exclusion of property from *restraining orders);

      * (ii) section 94 (which deals with the exclusion of property from forfeiture);

      * (iii) section 94A (which deals with compensation).

    * (2) However, the *responsible authority need not give a notice to a person under subsection (1) if the person has made:

     * (a) an application for an *extension order in relation to the property; and

     * (b) an application under section 30, 31 or 94 in relation to the property.

##### 93  Making an extension order extending the period before property is forfeited

    * (1) The court that made the *restraining order referred to in paragraph 92(1)(b) may make an order (an **_extension order_**) specifying an extended period for the purposes of subsection 92(3) if:

     * (a) an application for the order is made within 6 months after the start of the *conviction day for the relevant conviction; and

     * (b) the applicant has also applied to the court under:

      * (i) section 30 or 31 to exclude property from the restraining order; or

      * (ii) section 94 to exclude the property that is covered by the restraining order from forfeiture under this Part; and

     * (c) the court is satisfied that the applicant made the application under section 30, 31 or 94 without undue delay, and has since diligently followed up that application.

    * The extended period specified must end no later than 15 months from the start of the conviction day for the relevant conviction.

    * (2) The *extension order stops being in force if the application under section 30, 31 or 94 is finally determined before the end of the 6 month period starting on the *conviction day for the relevant conviction.

    * (3) The extended period ends if the application under section 30, 31 or 94 is finally determined before the end of that period.

    * (4) If the court makes the *extension order, the *responsible authority must take reasonable steps to give any person who has or claims, or whom the authority reasonably believes may have, an *interest in the property to which the order relates a written notice stating:

     * (a) the date on which the property will be forfeited under this Part, in accordance with the extension order, unless it is excluded from forfeiture; and

     * (b) the effect of subsections (2) and (3).

##### 94  Excluding property from forfeiture under this Part

    * (1) The court that made a *restraining order referred to in paragraph 92(1)(b) must make an order excluding particular property from forfeiture under this Part if:

    * (3) The person must give written notice to the *responsible authority of both the application and the grounds on which the order is sought.

    * (4) The *responsible authority may appear and adduce evidence at the hearing of the application.

    * (5) The *responsible authority must give the applicant notice of any grounds on which it proposes to contest the application. However, the authority need not do so until it has had a reasonable opportunity to conduct *examinations in relation to the application.

    * (6) The application must not be heard until the *responsible authority has had a reasonable opportunity to conduct *examinations in relation to the application.

##### 94A  Compensating for proportion of property not derived or realised from commission of any offence

    * (1) The court that made a *restraining order referred to in paragraph 92(1)(b) must make an order that complies with subsection (2) if:

     * (a) a person (the **_applicant_**) has applied for an order under this section; and

     * (b) the court is satisfied that the applicant has an *interest in property covered, or that was at any time covered, by the restraining order; and

     * (e) the court is satisfied that the applicant's interest is not an *instrument of any offence.

    * (2) An order under this section must:

     * (a) specify the proportion found by the court under paragraph (1)(d); and

     * (b) direct the Commonwealth, once the property has vested absolutely in it, to:

      * (i) if the property has not been disposed of--dispose of the property; and

      * (ii) pay the applicant an amount equal to that proportion of the difference between the amount received from disposing of the property and the sum of any payments of the kind referred to in paragraph 100(1)(b) in connection with the forfeiture.

    * (3) A person who claims an *interest in property covered by a *restraining order referred to in paragraph 92(1)(b) may apply to the court that made the restraining order for an order under this section at any time.

    * (4) However, if the property has already been forfeited under this Part, the person cannot, unless the court gives leave, apply under subsection (3) if he or she:

     * (a) either:

      * (i) was given a notice under subsection 92A(1) in relation to the property; or

      * (ii) was not given such a notice because of subsection 92A(2); and

     * (b) did not make the application under subsection (3) before that forfeiture.

    * (5) The court may give the person leave to apply if the court is satisfied that:

     * (a) the person had a good reason for not making the application before the forfeiture; or

     * (b) the person now has evidence relevant to the application that was not available before the forfeiture; or

     * (c) there are special grounds for granting the leave.

    * (7) The *responsible authority may appear and adduce evidence at the hearing of the application.

    * (8) The *responsible authority must give the applicant notice of any grounds on which it proposes to contest the application. However, the authority need not do so until it has had a reasonable opportunity to conduct *examinations in relation to the application.

    * (9) The application must not be heard until the *responsible authority has had a reasonable opportunity to conduct *examinations in relation to the application.

##### 95  Court may declare that property has been forfeited under this Part

#### Division 2--Effect of forfeiture on conviction of a serious offence

##### 96  When is property forfeited--general rule

    * Property forfeited under section 92 vests absolutely in the Commonwealth at the time of the forfeiture.

##### 97  First exception--registrable property

    * (1) Despite section 96, if property forfeited under section 92 is *registrable property:

     * (a) that property vests in equity in the Commonwealth but does not vest in the Commonwealth at law until the applicable registration requirements have been complied with; and

     * (b) the *responsible authority for the *restraining order referred to in paragraph 92(1)(b) has power, on behalf of the Commonwealth, to do anything necessary or convenient to give notice of, or otherwise protect, the Commonwealth's equitable interest in that property; and

     * (c) the Commonwealth is entitled to be registered as the owner of that property; and

     * (d) the *Official Trustee has power, on behalf of the Commonwealth, to do, or authorise the doing of, anything necessary or convenient to obtain the registration of the Commonwealth as the owner.

    * (2) Any action by the *responsible authority under paragraph (1)(b) is not a dealing for the purposes of subsection 99(1).

    * (3) The *Official Trustee's powers under paragraph (1)(d) include executing any instrument required to be executed by a person transferring an *interest in property of that kind.

##### 98  Second exception--if a joint owner dies

    * Despite section 96, if:

     * (a) a person who is convicted of a *serious offence was, immediately before his or her death, the joint owner of property; and

     * (b) the period that would apply under subsection 92(3) if the property were subject to forfeiture under section 92 in relation to the conviction had not ended before his or her death; and

     * (c) if that period had ended immediately before his or her death--the property would have been forfeited under section 92;

    * the property is taken to have vested in the Commonwealth immediately before his or her death.

##### 99  When can the Commonwealth begin dealing with forfeited property?

    * (1) The Commonwealth, and persons acting on its behalf, can dispose of, or otherwise deal with, property forfeited under section 92 in relation to a person's conviction of a *serious offence if and only if:

     * (a) the period applying under subsection (3) has come to an end; and

     * (b) the conviction has not been *quashed by that time.

    * (2) However, such disposals and dealings may occur earlier with the leave of the court and in accordance with any directions of the court.

    * (3) The period at the end of which the Commonwealth, and persons acting on its behalf, can dispose of or otherwise deal with the property is:

     * (a) if the conviction is one in relation to which neither paragraph 331(1)(b) nor (c) applies, the period ending:

      * (i) if the period provided for lodging an appeal against the conviction has ended without such an appeal having been lodged--at the end of that period; or

      * (ii) if an appeal against the conviction has been lodged--when the appeal lapses or is finally determined; or

     * (b) if the person is taken to have been convicted because of paragraph 331(1)(b), the period ending:

      * (i) if the period provided for lodging an appeal against the finding of the person guilty of the offence has ended without such an appeal having been lodged--at the end of that period; or

      * (ii) if an appeal against the finding of the person guilty of the offence has been lodged--when the appeal lapses or is finally determined; or

     * (c) if the person is taken to have been convicted because of paragraph 331(1)(c), the period ending:

      * (i) if the period provided for lodging an appeal against the person's conviction of the other offence referred to in that paragraph has ended without such an appeal having been lodged--at the end of that period; or

      * (ii) if an appeal against the person's conviction of the other offence referred to in that paragraph has been lodged--when the appeal lapses or is finally determined.

##### 100  How must forfeited property be dealt with?

    * (1) If subsection 99(1) no longer prevents disposal of or dealing with particular property forfeited under section 92, the *Official Trustee must, on the Commonwealth's behalf and as soon as practicable:

     * (a) dispose of any of the forfeited property that is not money; and

     * (b) apply:

      * (i) any amounts received from that disposal; and

      * (ii) any of the forfeited property that is money;

     * to payment of its remuneration and other costs, charges and expenses of the kind referred to in subsection 288(1) payable to or incurred by it in connection with the disposal and with the *restraining order that covered the property; and

     * (c) credit the remainder of the money and amounts received to the *Confiscated Assets Account as required by section 296.

    * (2) However, if the *Official Trustee has not yet begun to deal with property forfeited under section 92, as required by this section:

     * (a) the Minister; or

     * (b) a *senior Departmental officer authorised by the Minister for the purposes of this subsection;

    * may direct that the property be disposed of, or otherwise dealt with, as specified in the direction.

    * (3) Such a direction could be that property is to be disposed of in accordance with the provisions of a specified law.

        * Note: The quashing of a conviction of an offence relating to the forfeiture will prevent things being done under this section: see section 112.

##### 101  Minister may give supporting directions

    * (1) The Minister may give all directions that are necessary or convenient to realise the Commonwealth's *interest in property forfeited under section 92.

    * (2) This includes, for *registrable property forfeited under section 92, directing an officer of the Department or a *police officer to do anything necessary and reasonable to obtain possession of any document necessary for the transfer of the property.

#### Division 3--Recovery of forfeited property

##### 102  Court may make orders relating to transfer of forfeited property etc.

    * If property is forfeited to the Commonwealth under section 92, the court that made the *restraining order referred to in paragraph 92(1)(b) must, if:

     * (b) the court is satisfied that:

      * (i) it would not be contrary to the public interest for the interest to be transferred to the person; and

      * (ii) there is no other reason why the interest should not be transferred to the person;

    * make an order: 

     * (c) declaring the nature, extent and value (as at the time when the order is made) of the interest; and

      * (i) was given a notice under subsection 92A(1) in relation to the property; or

      * (ii) was not given such a notice because of subsection 92A(2); and

     * (c) in either case--there are other special grounds for granting the leave.

    * (4) The applicant must give written notice to the *responsible authority of both the application and the grounds on which the order is sought.

    * (5) The *responsible authority may appear and adduce evidence at the hearing of the application.

    * (6) The *responsible authority must give the applicant notice of any grounds on which it proposes to contest the application. However, the authority need not do so until it has had a reasonable opportunity to conduct *examinations in relation to the application.

    * (7) The application must not be heard until the *responsible authority has had a reasonable opportunity to conduct *examinations in relation to the application.

#### Division 4--The effect on forfeiture of convictions being quashed

##### 107  The effect on forfeiture of convictions being quashed

    * (1) A forfeiture of property to the Commonwealth under section 92 in relation to a person's conviction of an offence ceases to have effect if:

     * (a) the person's conviction of the offence is subsequently *quashed; and

     * (b) the forfeiture does not also relate to the person's conviction of other offences that have not been quashed; and

     * (c) the *responsible authority does not, within 14 days after the conviction is quashed, apply to the court that made the *restraining order referred to in paragraph 92(1)(b) for the forfeiture to be confirmed.

     * the forfeiture is taken not to be affected by the *quashing of the person's conviction of the offence; but

     * (b) to the extent that the property covered by the forfeiture is:

      * (i) in any case--not proceeds of the offence; and

        * (a) the benefits that a person has derived from such an offence; and

        * (b) (in some cases) the benefits that the person has derived from other unlawful activity.

    * (It is not always a requirement that a person has been convicted of the offence.)

#### Division 1--Making pecuniary penalty orders

##### 116  Making pecuniary penalty orders

    * (1) A court with *proceeds jurisdiction must make an order requiring a person to pay an amount to the Commonwealth if:

     * (b) the court is satisfied of either or both of the following:

      * (i) the person has been convicted of an *indictable offence, and has derived *benefits from the commission of the offence;

      * (ii) the person has committed a *serious offence.

        * Note: The conviction for, or reasonable grounds for suspecting commission of, an indictable offence could be used as grounds for a restraining order under Part 21 covering all or some of the person's property.

    * (3) In determining whether a person has derived a *benefit, the court may treat as property of the person any property that, in the court's opinion, is subject to the person's *effective control.

    * (4) The court's power to make a *pecuniary penalty order in relation to an offence is not affected by the existence of another *confiscation order in relation to that offence.

        * Note: There are restrictions on applications pecuniary penalty orders if previous applications for pecuniary penalty orders have already been made: see section 135.

##### 117  Pecuniary penalty orders made in relation to serious offence convictions

    * (1) A court must not make a *pecuniary penalty order in relation to a person's conviction of a *serious offence until after the end of the period of 6 months commencing on the *conviction day.

        * Note: Pecuniary penalty orders made under this subsection cannot be enforced within 6 months: see subsection 140(3).

    * (3) Subsection (1) does not apply if the person is taken to have been convicted of the *serious offence because of paragraph 331(1)(d).

##### 118  Making of pecuniary penalty order if person has absconded

    * If, because of paragraph 331(1)(d), a person is taken to have been convicted of an *indictable offence, a court must not make a *pecuniary penalty order in relation to the person's conviction unless:

     * (a) the court is satisfied, on the balance of probabilities, that the person has *absconded; and

     * (b) either:

      * (i) the person has been committed for trial for the offence; or

      * (ii) the court is satisfied, having regard to all the evidence before the court, that a reasonable jury, properly instructed, could lawfully find the person guilty of the offence.

##### 119  Ancillary orders

    * The court that made a *pecuniary penalty order, or any other court that could have made the pecuniary penalty order, may make orders ancillary to the pecuniary penalty order, either when it makes the pecuniary penalty order or at a later time.

##### 120  Acquittals do not affect pecuniary penalty orders

    * The fact that a person has been acquitted of an offence with which the person has been charged does not affect the court's power to make a *pecuniary penalty order in relation to the offence.

#### Division 2--Penalty amounts

##### Subdivision A--General

##### 121  Determining penalty amounts

    * (1) The amount that a person is ordered to pay to the Commonwealth under a *pecuniary penalty order (the **_penalty amount_**) is the amount the court determines under this Division.

     * (a) assessing under Subdivision B the value of the *benefits the person derived from the commission of the offence; and

     * (b) subtracting from that value the sum of all the reductions (if any) in the penalty amount under Subdivision C.

    * (3) If the offence to which the order relates is a *serious offence, the *penalty amount is determined by:

     * (a) assessing under Subdivision B the value of the *benefits the person derived from:

      * (i) the commission of that offence; and

      * (ii) subject to subsection (4), the commission of any other offence that constitutes *unlawful activity; and

     * (b) subtracting from that value the sum of all the reductions (if any) in the penalty amount under Subdivision C.

##### 122  Evidence the court is to consider

    * (1) In assessing the value of *benefits that a person has derived from the commission of an offence or offences (the **_illegal activity_**), the court is to have regard to the evidence before it concerning all or any of the following:

     * (b) the value of any other benefit that, because of the illegal activity, was provided to the person or another person;

     * (c) if any of the illegal activity consisted of doing an act or thing in relation to a *narcotic substance:

      * (i) the market value, at the time of the offence, of similar or substantially similar narcotic substances; and

      * (ii) the amount that was, or the range of amounts that were, ordinarily paid for the doing of a similar or substantially similar act or thing;

     * (d) the value of the *person's property before, during and after the illegal activity;

     * (e) the person's income and expenditure before, during and after the illegal activity.

    * (2) At the hearing of an application for a *pecuniary penalty order, a *police officer, or a *Customs officer, who is experienced in the investigation of narcotics offences may testify, to the best of the officer's information, knowledge and belief:

     * (a) with respect to the amount that was the market value of a *narcotic substance at a particular time or during a particular period; or

##### 123  Value of benefits derived--nonserious offences

    * (1) If:

     * (a) an application is made for a *pecuniary penalty order against a person in relation to an offence or offences (the **_illegal activity_**); and

     * (b) the offence is not a *serious offence, or none of the offences are serious offences; and

     * (c) at the hearing of the application, evidence is given that the value of the *person's property during or after the illegal activity exceeded the value of the person's property before the illegal activity;

    * the court is to treat the value of the *benefits derived by the person from the commission of the illegal activity as being not less than the amount of the greatest excess.

    * (2) The amount treated as the value of the *benefits under this section is reduced to the extent (if any) that the court is satisfied that the excess was due to causes unrelated to the illegal activity.

##### 124  Value of benefits derived--serious offences

    * (1) If:

     * (a) an application is made for a *pecuniary penalty order against a person in relation to an offence or offences (the **_illegal activity_**); and

     * (b) the offence is a *serious offence, or one or more of the offences are serious offences; and

      * (i) the illegal activity; or

      * (ii) any other *unlawful activity that the person has engaged in that constitutes a *terrorism offence; or

      * (iii) any other unlawful activity that the person has engaged in, within the period referred to in subsection (5), that does not constitute a terrorism offence;

     * exceeded the value of the person's property before the illegal activity and the other unlawful activity;

    * the court is to treat the value of the *benefits derived by the person from the commission of the illegal activity as being not less than the amount of the greatest excess.

    * (2) The amount treated as the value of the *benefits under subsection (1) is reduced to the extent (if any) that the court is satisfied that the excess was due to causes unrelated to:

     * (a) the illegal activity; or

     * (b) any other *unlawful activity that the person has engaged in that constitutes a *terrorism offence; or

     * (c) any other unlawful activity that the person has engaged in, within the period referred to in subsection (5), that does not constitute a terrorism offence;

    * (3) If evidence is given, at the hearing of the application, of the person's expenditure during the period referred to in subsection (5), the amount of the expenditure is presumed, unless the contrary is proved, to be the value of a *benefit that, because of the illegal activity, was provided to the person.

    * (4) Subsection (3) does not apply to expenditure to the extent that it resulted in acquisition of property that is taken into account under subsection (1).

    * (5) The period for the purposes of subparagraph (1)(c)(iii), paragraph (2)(c) and subsection (3) is:

     * (a) if some or all of the person's property, or property that is suspected of being subject to the *effective control of the person, is covered by a *restraining order--the period of 6 years preceding the application for the restraining order;

     * (b) otherwise--the period of 6 years preceding the application for the *pecuniary penalty order;

    * and includes the period since that application for the restraining order or the pecuniary penalty order was made.

##### 125  Value of benefits may be as at time of assessment

    * (1) In quantifying the value of a *benefit for the purposes of this Subdivision, the court may treat as the value of the benefit the value that the benefit would have had if derived at the time the court makes its assessment of the value of benefits.

    * (2) Without limiting subsection (1), the court may have regard to any decline in the purchasing power of money between the time when the *benefit was derived and the time the court makes its assessment.

##### 126  Matters that do not reduce the value of benefits

    * In assessing the value of *benefits that a person has derived from the commission of an offence or offences (the **_illegal activity_**), none of the following are to be subtracted:

     * (a) expenses or outgoings the person incurred in relation to the illegal activity;

     * (b) the value of any benefits that the person derives as *agent for, or otherwise on behalf of, another person (whether or not the other person receives any of the benefits).

##### 127  Benefits already the subject of pecuniary penalty

    * (1) A *benefit is not to be taken into account for the purposes of this Subdivision if a pecuniary penalty has been imposed in respect of the benefit under:

     * (a) this Act; or

     * (b) Division 3 of Part XIII of the _Customs Act 1901_; or

     * (c) a law of a Territory; or

     * (d) a law of a State.

    * (2) To avoid doubt, an amount payable under a *literary proceeds order is a pecuniary penalty for the purposes of this section.

##### 128  Property under a person's effective control

    * In assessing the value of *benefits that a person has derived, the court may treat as property of the person any property that, in the court's opinion, is subject to the person's *effective control.

##### 129  Effect of property vesting in an insolvency trustee

    * In assessing the value of *benefits that a person has derived, the *person's property is taken to continue to be the person's property if it vests in any of the following:

     * (a) in relation to a bankruptcy--the trustee of the estate of the bankrupt; or

     * (b) in relation to a composition or scheme of arrangement under Division 6 of Part IV of the _Bankruptcy Act 1966_--the trustee of the composition or scheme of arrangement; or

    * Tax paid after application for order is made

    * (1A) The court may, if it considers that it is in the interests of justice to do so, reduce the *penalty amount under a *pecuniary penalty order against a person by an amount that, in the court's opinion, represents the extent to which tax that the person has paid at or after the time the application for the order is made is attributable to the *benefits to which the order relates.

##### Subdivision D--Varying pecuniary penalty orders to increase penalty amounts

##### 133  Varying pecuniary penalty orders to increase penalty amounts

    * (1) The court may, on the application of the *responsible authority, vary a *pecuniary penalty order against a person by increasing the *penalty amount if one or more of subsections (2), (2A) or (3) apply. The amount of each increase is as specified in the relevant subsection.

    * (2) The *penalty amount may be increased if:

     * (a) the penalty amount was reduced under section 130 to take account of a forfeiture of property or a proposed *forfeiture order against property; and

     * (b) an appeal against the forfeiture or forfeiture order is allowed, or the proceedings for the proposed forfeiture order terminate without the proposed forfeiture order being made.

    * The amount of the increase is equal to the value of the property.

    * (2A) The *penalty amount may be increased if:

     * (a) the penalty amount was reduced under section 130 to take account of a forfeiture of property or a proposed *forfeiture order against property; and

      * (i) an order under section 73 or 94 excluding an *interest in the property from forfeiture;

      * (ii) an order under section 77 or 94A (which deal with compensation) directing the Commonwealth to pay an amount to a person in relation to a proportion of an interest in the property that was not derived or realised from the commission of any offence;

##### 135  Additional application for a pecuniary penalty order

    * (1) A *proceeds of crime authority cannot, unless the court gives leave, apply for a *pecuniary penalty order against a person in respect of *benefits the person derived from the commission of an offence if:

      * (i) under this Division; or

      * (ii) under another law of the Commonwealth; or

     * for a pecuniary penalty in respect of those benefits the person derived from the commission of the offence; and

     * (b) necessary evidence became available only after the first application was determined; or

     * (c) it is in the interests of justice to give the leave.

#### Division 4--Enforcement of pecuniary penalty orders

##### 140  Enforcement of pecuniary penalty orders

    * (1) An amount payable by a person to the Commonwealth under a *pecuniary penalty order is a civil debt due by the person to the Commonwealth.

    * (2) A *pecuniary penalty order against a person may be enforced as if it were an order made in civil proceedings instituted by the Commonwealth against the person to recover a debt due by the person to the Commonwealth.

    * (3) However, if the order was made under subsection 117(2) when sentence was being passed on the person for the offence to which the order relates, the order cannot be enforced against the person within the period of 6 months after the order was made.

    * (4) The debt arising from the order is taken to be a judgment debt.

    * (5) If a *pecuniary penalty order is made against a person after the person's death, this section has effect as if the person had died on the day after the order was made.

##### 141  Property subject to a person's effective control

    * (1) If:

     * (a) a person is subject to a *pecuniary penalty order; and

     * (b) the *responsible authority applies to the court for an order under this section; and

    * the court may make an order declaring that the whole, or a specified part, of that property is available to satisfy the pecuniary penalty order.

    * (2) The order under subsection (1) may be enforced against the property as if the property were the *person's property.

    * (3) A *restraining order may be made in respect of the property as if:

     * (a) the property were the *person's property; and

     * (b) the person had committed a *serious offence.

    * (4) If the *responsible authority applies for an order under subsection (1) relating to particular property, the authority must give written notice of the application to:

     * (a) the person who is subject to the *pecuniary penalty order; and

     * (b) any person whom the authority has reason to believe may have an *interest in the property.

    * (5) The person who is subject to the *pecuniary penalty order, and any person who claims an *interest in the property, may appear and adduce evidence at the hearing of the application.

##### 142  Charge on property subject to restraining order

    * (1) If:

     * (a) a *pecuniary penalty order is made against a person in relation to an *indictable offence; and

     * (b) a *restraining order is, or has been, made against:

      * (i) the *person's property; or

      * (ii) another person's property in relation to which an order under subsection 141(1) is, or has been, made; and

     * (c) the restraining order relates to that offence or a *related offence;

    * then, upon the making of the later of the orders, there is created, by force of this section, a charge on the property to secure the payment to the Commonwealth of the *penalty amount.

    * (2) The charge ceases to have effect in respect of the property:

     * (a) if the *pecuniary penalty order was made in relation to the person's conviction of the *indictable offence and that conviction is *quashed--upon the order being discharged under Division 5; or

     * (b) upon the discharge of the pecuniary penalty order or the *restraining order by a court hearing an appeal against the making of the order; or

     * (c) upon payment to the Commonwealth of the *penalty amount in satisfaction of the pecuniary penalty order; or

     * (d) upon the sale or other disposition of the property:

      * (i) under an order under Division 4 of Part 41; or

      * (ii) by the owner of the property with the consent of the court that made the pecuniary penalty order; or

      * (iii) if the restraining order directed the *Official Trustee to take custody and control of the property--by the owner of the property with the consent of the Official Trustee; or

     * (e) upon the sale of the property to a purchaser in good faith for value who, at the time of purchase, has no notice of the charge;

    * whichever first occurs.

     * (b) has priority over all other encumbrances; and

     * (c) subject to subsection (2), is not affected by any change of ownership of the property.

    * (4) Subsection 73(2) of the _Personal Property Securities Act 2009_ applies to the charge (to the extent, if any, to which that Act applies in relation to the property charged).

        * Note 1: The effect of this subsection is that the priority between the charge and a security interest in the property to which the _Personal Property Securities Act 2009_ applies is to be determined in accordance with this Act rather than the _Personal Property Securities Act 2009_.

        * Note 2: Subsection 73(2) of the _Personal Property Securities Act 2009_ applies to charges created by this section after the commencement of subsection (4) (which is at the registration commencement time within the meaning of the _Personal Property Securities Act 2009_).

##### 143  Charges may be registered

    * (1) If:

     * (a) a charge is created by section 142 on property of a particular kind; and

     * (b) the provisions of any law of the Commonwealth or of a State or Territory provide for the registration of title to, or charges over, property of that kind;

    * **_registration_** of a charge on a particular kind of personal property within the meaning of the _Personal Property Securities Act 2009 _includes the registration of data in relation to that kind of property for the purposes of paragraph 148(c) of that Act.

        * Note: The _Personal Property Securities Act 2009_ provides for the registration of such data only if regulations are made for the purposes of paragraph 148(c) of that Act.

    * (2) The certificate may be registered, in accordance with the regulations, in a court having jurisdiction with respect to the recovery of debts of an amount equal to the amount of the relevant order.

    * (3) Upon registration in a court, the certificate is enforceable in all respects as a final judgment of the court in favour of the Commonwealth.

#### Division 5--The effect on pecuniary penalty orders of convictions being quashed

##### 145  Pecuniary penalty order unaffected if not made in relation to a conviction

    * A *pecuniary penalty order made in relation to an offence but not made in relation to a person's conviction of the offence is not affected if the person is convicted of the offence and the conviction is subsequently *quashed.

##### 146  Discharge of pecuniary penalty order if made in relation to a conviction

    * (1) Subject to subsections (2) and (3), a *pecuniary penalty order made in relation to a person's conviction of an offence is discharged if:

    * (2) Unless and until a court decides otherwise on such an application, the *quashing of the conviction does not affect the *pecuniary penalty order:

     * (a) for 14 days after the conviction is quashed; and

     * (b) if the *responsible authority makes such an application.

    * (2A) To avoid doubt, the *responsible authority may make an application to confirm the order and an application to vary the order, and the court may hear both applications at the same time.

    * (3) A *pecuniary penalty order made in relation to a person's conviction of an offence is discharged if:

     * including any appeals relating to such a conviction; and

     * (b) the evidence given in any such proceeding.

##### 149  Court may confirm pecuniary penalty order

    * The court may confirm the *pecuniary penalty order if the court is satisfied that, when the *responsible authority applied for the order, the court could have made the order without relying on the person's conviction that was *quashed.

    * (1) The court may vary the *pecuniary penalty order by reducing the *penalty amount by an amount worked out under subsection (2) if the court is satisfied that:

     * (a) the order relates to more than one offence; and

     * (b) when the *responsible authority applied for the order, the court could have made the order in relation to at least one of the offences that has not been *quashed.

    * (2) The amount is an amount equal to so much of the *penalty amount as the court reasonably believes to be attributable to a person's conviction of an offence:

     * (a) to which the *pecuniary penalty order relates; and

    * (2) If the court decides not to confirm or vary the *pecuniary penalty order, the order is discharged.

### Part 25--Literary proceeds orders

##### 151  Simplified outline of this Part

    * If certain offences have been committed, literary proceeds orders can be made, ordering payments to the Commonwealth of amounts based on the literary proceeds that a person has derived in relation to such an offence. (There is no requirement that a person has been convicted of the offence.)

#### Division 1--Making literary proceeds orders

##### 152  Making literary proceeds orders

    * (1) A court with *proceeds jurisdiction may make an order requiring a person to pay an amount to the Commonwealth if:

     * (a) a *proceeds of crime authority applies for the order; and

     * (b) the court is satisfied that the person has committed an *indictable offence (whether or not the person has been convicted of the offence); and

     * (c) the court is satisfied that the person has derived *literary proceeds in relation to the offence.

    * (2) A court with *proceeds jurisdiction may make an order requiring a person to pay an amount to the Commonwealth if:

     * (a) a *proceeds of crime authority applies for the order; and

     * (b) the court is satisfied that the person has committed a *foreign indictable offence (whether or not the person has been convicted of the offence); and

     * (c) the court is satisfied that the person has derived *literary proceeds in relation to the offence.

    * (3) However, the *literary proceeds must have been derived after the commencement of this Act.

        * Note: Because of section 14, it does not matter whether the offence to which the order relates was committed before or after the commencement of this Act.

    * (4) The court's power to make a *literary proceeds order in relation to an offence is not affected by the existence of another *confiscation order in relation to that offence.

##### 153  Meaning of literary proceeds

     * (a) publishing any material in written or electronic form; or

     * (b) any use of media from which visual images, words or sounds can be produced; or

     * (c) any live entertainment, representation or interview.

    * (3) If the offence is an *indictable offence, it does not matter whether the *benefits are derived within or outside *Australia.

    * (3A) If the offence is a *foreign indictable offence, then a *benefit is not treated as *literary proceeds unless the benefit is derived in *Australia or transferred to .

    * (4) In determining:

     * (a) whether a person has derived *literary proceeds; or

     * (b) the value of literary proceeds that a person has derived;

    * the court may treat as property of the person any property that, in the court's opinion:

     * (c) is subject to the person's *effective control; or

##### 157  Acquittals do not affect literary proceeds orders

    * The fact that a person has been acquitted of an offence with which the person has been charged does not affect the court's power to make a *literary proceeds order in relation to the offence.

#### Division 2--Literary proceeds amounts

##### 158  Determining literary proceeds amounts

    * (1) The amount that a person is ordered to pay to the Commonwealth under a *literary proceeds order (the **_literary proceeds amount_**) is the amount that the court thinks appropriate.

     * (a) the value of property of the person forfeited under a *forfeiture order, an *interstate forfeiture order or a *foreign forfeiture order was deducted from the literary proceeds amount under paragraph 159(b); and

     * (b) an appeal against the forfeiture, or against the order, is allowed.

    * The amount of the increase is equal to the value of the property.

    * (3) The *literary proceeds amount may be increased if:

     * (a) an amount payable under a *pecuniary penalty order, an order under section 243B of the _Customs Act 1901_, an *interstate pecuniary penalty order or a *foreign pecuniary penalty order was deducted from the *literary proceeds amount under paragraph 159(c); and

     * (b) an appeal against the amount payable, or against the order, is allowed.

    * The amount of the increase is equal to the amount that was payable.

    * (4) The *literary proceeds amount may be increased if:

    * the court may make an order declaring that the whole, or a specified part, of that property is available to satisfy the literary proceeds order.

    * (2) The order under subsection (1) may be enforced against the property as if the property were the *person's property.

    * (3) A *restraining order may be made in respect of the property as if:

     * (a) the property were the *person's property; and

     * (b) the person had committed a *serious offence.

    * (4) If the *responsible authority applies for an order under subsection (1) relating to particular property, the authority must give written notice of the application to:

      * (i) the *person's property; or

      * (ii) another person's property in relation to which an order under subsection 168(1) is, or has been, made; and

     * (c) the restraining order relates to that offence or a *related offence;

    * then, upon the making of the later of the orders, there is created, by force of this section, a charge on the property to secure the payment to the Commonwealth of the *literary proceeds amount.

    * (2) The charge ceases to have effect in respect of the property:

     * (a) if the *literary proceeds order was made in relation to the person's conviction of the *indictable offence and that conviction is *quashed--upon the order being discharged under Division 5; or

     * (b) upon the discharge of the literary proceeds order or the *restraining order by a court hearing an appeal against the making of the order; or

      * (iii) where the restraining order directed the *Official Trustee to take custody and control of the property--by the owner of the property with the consent of the Official Trustee; or

     * (e) upon the sale of the property to a purchaser in good faith for value who, at the time of purchase, has no notice of the charge;

    * whichever first occurs.

    * (3) The charge:

     * (a) is subject to every *encumbrance on the property (other than an encumbrance in which the person referred to in paragraph (1)(a) has an *interest) that came into existence before the charge and that would, apart from this subsection, have priority over the charge; and

    * (4) Subsection 73(2) of the _Personal Property Securities Act 2009_ applies to the charge (to the extent, if any, to which that Act applies in relation to the property charged).

        * Note 1: The effect of this subsection is that the priority between the charge and a security interest in the property to which the _Personal Property Securities Act 2009_ applies is to be determined in accordance with this Act rather than the _Personal Property Securities Act 2009_.

        * Note 2: Subsection 73(2) of the _Personal Property Securities Act 2009_ applies to charges created by this section after the commencement of subsection (4) (which is at the registration commencement time within the meaning of the _Personal Property Securities Act 2009_).

    * (1) A *literary proceeds order made in relation to a person's conviction of an offence is discharged if:

     * (b) the *responsible authority does not, within 14 days after the conviction is quashed, apply to the court that made the order for the order to be confirmed.

    * (2) However, unless and until a court decides otherwise on such an application, the *quashing of the conviction does not affect the *literary proceeds order:

     * (a) for 14 days after the conviction is quashed; and

     * (b) if the *responsible authority makes such an application.

##### 174  Notice of application for confirmation of literary proceeds order

    * The *responsible authority must give to the person written notice of an application for confirmation of the *literary proceeds order.

     * including any appeals relating to the conviction; and

     * (b) the evidence given in any such proceeding.

##### 176  Court may confirm literary proceeds order

    * The court may confirm the *literary proceeds order if the court is satisfied that, when the *responsible authority applied for the order, the court could have made the order:

     * (a) on the ground that the person had committed the offence in relation to which the person's conviction was *quashed; and

     * (b) without relying on the person's conviction of the offence.

##### 177  Effect of court's decision on confirmation of literary proceeds order

    * (1) If the court confirms the *literary proceeds order under section 176, the order is taken not to be affected by the *quashing of the person's conviction of the offence.

    * (2) If the court decides not to confirm the *literary proceeds order, the order is discharged.

#### Division 6--Literary proceeds orders covering future literary proceeds

##### 178  Literary proceeds orders can cover future literary proceeds

    * (1) The court may include in a *literary proceeds order one or more amounts in relation to *benefits that the person who is the subject of the order may derive in the future if the court is satisfied that:

     * (a) the person will derive the benefits; and

     * (b) if the person derives the benefits, they will be *literary proceeds in relation to the offence to which the order relates.

    * (2) However, the court must not include an amount in the order unless the *responsible authority, in its application for the order, requested the inclusion in the order of one or more amounts in relation to *benefits that the person who would be the subject of the order may derive in the future.

    * (3) Each amount included in the order is to be an amount that the court considers would be a *literary proceeds amount in relation to a *benefit that the person may derive in the future, if the court were to make a *literary proceeds order after the person derived the benefit.

        * Note: Division 2 describes how literary proceeds amounts are determined.

##### 179  Enforcement of literary proceeds orders in relation to future literary proceeds

    * If: 

     * (a) an amount is included in a *literary proceeds order in relation to *benefits that the person who is the subject of the order may derive in the future; and

     * (b) the person subsequently derives those benefits;

    * immediately the benefits are derived, Division 4 applies to the amount as if it were a *literary proceeds amount under a literary proceeds order.

    * (3) The court must make the order under subsection (1) without notice having been given to any person if the *responsible authority requests the court to do so.

    * Refusal to make preliminary unexplained wealth order

    * (4) Despite subsection (1), the court may refuse to make the *preliminary unexplained wealth order if the court is satisfied that there are not reasonable grounds to suspect that the person's *total wealth exceeds by $100,000 or more the value of the person's *wealth that was *lawfully acquired.

     * (a) within 28 days after the person is notified of the *preliminary unexplained wealth order; or

     * (b) if the person applies to the court, within that period of 28 days, for an extension of the time for applying for revocation--within such longer period, not exceeding 3 months, as the court allows.

    * (4) However, the *preliminary unexplained wealth order remains in force until the court revokes the order.

    * (5) The court may revoke the *preliminary unexplained wealth order on application under subsection (1) if satisfied that:
