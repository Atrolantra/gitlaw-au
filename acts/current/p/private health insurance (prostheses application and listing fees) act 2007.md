  * for different circumstances.

  * (2) The maximum amount of an application fee or initial listing fee is:

   * (b) in relation to a later financial year--the amount worked out under section 6.

##### 6  Indexation of maximum fees

  * (1) For the purposes of paragraphs 5(2)(b) and (3)(b), the maximum amount of a fee is worked out by multiplying the indexation factor for the financial year by the maximum amount of the fee in the previous financial year.

  * (2) The **_indexation factor for the financial year_** is the amount worked out, to 3 decimal places (rounding up if the fourth decimal place is 5 or more), by using this formula:

  * where: 

  * **_index number_**, for a quarter, is the All Groups Consumer Price Index number (being the weighted average of the 8 capital cities) published by the Australian Statistician for the quarter and in force at the time the indexation factor for the financial year is worked out under this section.

  * (3) If the indexation factor for the financial year worked out under subsection (2) is 1 or less, the maximum amount of:

   * (a) an application fee or an initial listing fee in relation to an application made in the financial year; or

   * (b) an ongoing listing fee imposed on an ongoing listing fee imposition day in the financial year;

  * is the previous year's maximum.

   * (a) the initial listing fee for the application, at the time the person is informed of the Minister's decision to grant the application; and

   * (b) the ongoing listing fee, on each subsequent ongoing listing fee imposition day.

  * (3) If there is no applicant in relation to a kind of prosthesis because the prosthesis was listed in the Private Health Insurance (Prostheses) Rules in accordance with section 12 of the _Private Health Insurance (Transitional Provisions and Consequential Amendments) Act 2007_, then the person who was, immediately before the commencement of the _Private Health Insurance Act 2007_, the sponsor of that prosthesis for the purposes of the _National Health Act 1953_ is liable to pay the ongoing listing fee on each ongoing listing fee imposition day.
