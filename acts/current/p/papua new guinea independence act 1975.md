AND WHEREAS, in accordance with Chapter XII of that Charter, the General Assembly of the United Nations on 13 December 1946 approved the terms of a Trusteeship Agreement for the Territory of New Guinea, submitted to it by the Government of Australia, in substitution for the terms of the Mandate, which agreement designates the Government of Australia as the sole Authority to exercise the administration of the Territory of New Guinea:

AND WHEREAS the _Papua and New Guinea Act_ 1949 provided for the administration of the Territory of Papua and the Territory of New Guinea by Australia in an administrative union, by the name of the Territory of Papua and New Guinea, whilst maintaining the identity and status of the Territory of New Guinea as a Trust Territory and the identity and status of the Territory of Papua as a Possession of the Crown:

AND WHEREAS on 18 November 1963 a House of Assembly was established by the _Papua and New Guinea Act_ 1963 to make laws for the peace, order and good government of the Territory of Papua and New Guinea:

AND WHEREAS, by virtue of the _Papua New Guinea Act_ 1971, the Territories governed in the administrative union became together known as Papua New Guinea:

AND WHEREAS on 9 July 1974 the House of Assembly resolved that Papua New Guinea move to independent nation status: 

AND WHEREAS the General Assembly of the United Nations on 13 December 1974 noted that resolution and resolved that, on the date on which Papua New Guinea became independent, the Trusteeship Agreement would cease to be in force:

AND WHEREAS on 18 June 1975 the House of Assembly nominated 16 September 1975 as the date on which Papua New Guinea is to become independent: 

AND WHEREAS on 16 September 1975 Papua New Guinea is to become an independent sovereign state by the name of the Independent State of Papua New Guinea, having a constitution established, adopted and given to themselves by the people of Papua New Guinea acting through their Constituent Assembly:

BE IT THEREFORE ENACTED by the Queen, the Senate and the House of Representatives of Australia, as follows:
