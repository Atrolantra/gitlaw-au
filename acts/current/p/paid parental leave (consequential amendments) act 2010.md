      * (a) the dependant is included in class 1 or 2 in the table in subsection 159J(2); and

      * (b) during that part of the year:

       * (ii) parental leave pay is payable under the _Paid Parental Leave Act 2010_ to the taxpayer, or to the taxpayer's spouse while being the taxpayer's partner (within the meaning of that Act).

        * Note: That part of the year may be the whole year.

        * Note: The **_shared care period_** may be the whole year.

     * (4) The formula is:

     * where: 

     * **_applicable rebate amount_** is the amount of rebate that would have been allowable under section 159J in respect of the shared care period but for subsection (3) of this section.

     * **_nonshared care rate _**is the rate that would be the standard rate in respect of the taxpayer or the taxpayer's spouse under clause 30 of Schedule 1 to the _A New Tax System (Family Assistance) Act 1999_ if:

      * (a) clause 31 of that Schedule did not apply; and

     * (2) Subject to subsection (3), the rebate allowable to the taxpayer under section 159L in respect of the housekeeper for the part (if any) of the year not covered by subsection (1) of this section is such part of the rebate specified in subsection 159L(2) in relation to the taxpayer as, in the Commissioner's opinion, is reasonable in the circumstances.

##### 1  Employer determination made where expected or actual date of birth is before 1 July 2011

   * (1) The _Paid Parental Leave Act 2010_ applies, with the modifications set out in this item, in relation to a person who has made a claim for parental leave pay for a child, if:

      * (a) for a claim made before the day the child is born--the expected date of birth of the child is before 1 July 2011; or

      * (b) for a claim made after the child is born--the day the child is born is before 1 July 2011.

   * Note: For a claim made before the day the child is born, see subitem (9) if the expected date of birth of the child is before 1 July 2011, but the child is born on or after that date.

   * (2) Section 101 of that Act (and the other provisions of that Act so far as they relate to that section) applies in relation to the person as if subsections (1) and (2) of that section were omitted and the following subsection substituted:

     * (1) The Secretary must make a determination under this section (the **_employer determination_**) that a person's employer is to pay the person instalments if the Secretary is satisfied, when making the determination, that:

      * (a) a payability determination that parental leave pay is payable to the person, or an initial eligibility determination for the person, is in force; and

      * (b) the employer has made an election under section 109 that applies to the person; and

      * (c) the person has consented in the claim to the employer paying instalments to the person; and

      * (d) the person is likely to be an Australianbased employee of the employer during whichever of the following periods applies:

       * (i) if the Secretary has made a payability determination that parental leave pay is payable to the person--the person's PPL period;

       * (ii) otherwise--the period of days for which instalments are likely, if the determination is made, to be payable to the person by the employer; and

      * (e) the employer has an ABN; and

      * (f) if paragraphs (b) to (e) are satisfied in relation to more than one employer of the person--the person nominated the employer in the claim as the employer who would be required to pay instalments to the person.

   * (3) For the purposes of this item, an employer determination made under subsection 101(1), as that subsection applies because of subitem (2) of this item, is a **_transitional employer determination_**.

   * (4) The following provisions of that Act do not apply in relation to a transitional employer determination:

      * (a) section 103 (which deals with responding to a notice of an employer determination);

      * (b) subsection 107(2) (which deals with when an employer determination comes into force);

      * (c) subsections 207(3) and 224(1) (which deal with applying for review of employer determination decisions).

   * (5) Within 14 days after the date of the notice given under section 102 of that Act in relation to the transitional employer determination, the employer may give the Secretary a written notice (the **_acceptance notice_**) that complies with section 104 of that Act.

   * (6) If the employer gives the acceptance notice to the Secretary within that 14 day period, the transitional employer determination comes into force on the day the Secretary receives the acceptance notice.

   * (7) If the employer does not give the acceptance notice to the Secretary within that 14 day period, the following paragraphs have effect:

      * (a) the Secretary must revoke the transitional employer determination;

      * (b) the revocation comes into force on the day of the revocation;

      * (c) to avoid doubt, subsection 108(5) of that Act (which deals with giving notice of the revocation) applies in relation to the revocation.

   * (8) The Secretary may extend the 14 day period referred to in subitem (5) in relation to an employer. If the Secretary does so, subitems (6) and (7) have effect accordingly.

   * (9) Despite paragraph (1)(a) and subitem (2) of this item, if the person's child is born on or after 1 July 2011, then the following paragraphs have effect:

      * (a) the Secretary may make an employer determination for the person and the person's employer under section 101 of the _Paid Parental Leave Act 2010_, as that section applies apart from this item;

      * (b) if the Secretary does so and has previously made a transitional employer determination for the person and the employer, the Secretary is taken never to have made the transitional employer determination.

   * (10) The following provisions of the _Paid Parental Leave Act 2010_, apply in relation to this item as if it were a provision of that Act:

      * (a) section 275 (which deals with how that Act applies to an adopted child);

      * (b) section 276 (which deals with how that Act applies to claims made in exceptional circumstances).

##### 2  Employer determination made where expected date of birth is on or after 1 July 2011 but child born before that date

      * (a) the Secretary makes an employer determination for an employer and a person under the _Paid Parental Leave Act 2010_; and

      * (b) the person's claim is made before the day the child is born; and

      * (c) the expected date of birth of the child is on or after 1 July 2011; and

      * (d) the child is born before 1 July 2011; and

      * (e) the person's employer has not made an election under section 109 of that Act that applies to the person.

   * (2) If, after the employer determination is made, the Secretary makes a payability determination that parental leave pay is payable to the person for the child, the notice given to the employer under section 113 of that Act must:

      * (a) state the day the child was born; and

      * (b) be dated as at the date the preparation of the notice was completed; and

      * (c) contain a statement to the effect that the employer determination will be revoked, unless the employer:

       * (i) agrees to being required to pay instalments to the person, even though the child was born before 1 July 2011; and

       * (ii) gives the Secretary a written notice indicating that agreement within 14 days of the date referred to in paragraph (b).

   * (3) If the employer does not give the notice referred to in subparagraph (2)(c)(ii) to the Secretary within that 14 day period, the following paragraphs have effect:

      * (a) the Secretary must revoke the employer determination;

      * (b) the revocation comes into force on the day of the revocation;

      * (c) to avoid doubt, subsection 108(5) of that Act (which deals with giving notice of the revocation) applies in relation to the revocation;

      * (d) section 103 of that Act (which deals with responding to a notice of an employer determination) is taken to have never applied in relation to the employer determination.

   * (4) The following provisions of that Act apply in relation to this item as if it were a provision of that Act:

      * (a) section 275 (which deals with how that Act applies to an adopted child);

      * (b) section 276 (which deals with how that Act applies to claims made in exceptional circumstances).

      * (c) an individual's eligibility under subsection 36(4) of the _A New Tax System (Family Assistance) Act 1999_ for baby bonus in respect of a child who was delivered before 1 January 2011; or

##### 4  Eligibility for maternity immunisation allowance
