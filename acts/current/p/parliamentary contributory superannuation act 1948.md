      * (a) where the whole of the transfer value was so paid--that transfer value shall be disregarded for the purposes of this Act; or

      * (b) where part of the transfer value was so paid--the amount of that transfer value shall be deemed, for the purposes of this Act, to be reduced by the amount so paid.

    * (3) Subject to subsection (4), a transfer value shall be deemed for the purposes of this Act to have become payable in respect of a person under a superannuation scheme upon the termination of any employment if, upon the termination of that employment, the person was the owner of a life policy, or was entitled to have the rights of the owner of a life policy assigned to him or her, being a policy the premiums for which were, while the person was employed in that employment, paid in whole or in part by the person's employer, and, in that case, the surrender value of the policy as at the date of the termination of the employment shall be taken to be the amount of the transfer value.

    * (4) Where a transfer value is, by virtue of subsection (3), deemed for the purposes of this Act to have become payable in respect of a person upon the termination of any employment by reason that, upon the termination of that employment, the person was the owner of a life policy, or was entitled to have the rights of the owner of a life policy assigned to him or her, a transfer value shall not be deemed, for those purposes, to have become payable in respect of the person upon the termination of any previous employment by reason that, upon the termination of that previous employment, the person was the owner of that policy, or was entitled to have the rights of the owner of that policy assigned to him or her.

##### 4B  Marital or couple relationship

    * (2) For the purpose of subsection (1), a person is to be regarded as ordinarily living with another person as that other person's husband or wife or partner on a permanent and _bona fide _domestic basis at a particular time only if:

      * (b) the person had been living with that other person as that other person's husband or wife or partner for a continuous period of less than 3 years up to that time and the Trust, having regard to any relevant evidence, is of the opinion that the person ordinarily lived with that other person as that other person's husband or wife or partner on a permanent and _bona fide_ domestic basis at that time;

    * whether or not the person was legally married to that other person.

    * (3) For the purposes of this Act, a marital or couple relationship is taken to have begun at the beginning of the continuous period mentioned in paragraph (2)(a) or (b).

    * (4) If paragraph 18(10B)(b) applies, then:

      * (a) the **_additional service factor at the payment time_** is 0.75; and

      * (b) if, at the operative time, the member spouse is not entitled to parliamentary allowance, then the **_additional service factor at the operative time_** for the highestpaid office to which paragraph 18(10B)(b) applies is 0.75; and

      * (c) if, at the operative time, the member spouse is entitled to parliamentary allowance, then the **_additional service factor at the operative time_** for the highestpaid office to which paragraph 18(10B)(b) applies is worked out as follows:

       * (i) calculate a factor under paragraph (2)(b) of this section for each office referred to in paragraph 18(10B)(b), other than an office for which the period of service began after the operative time;

       * (ii) for each such factor, calculate a weighted factor under subsection (6) of this section;

      * (c) the member spouse and the nonmember spouse are both alive at the operative time; and

      * (d) if a base amount applies--the base amount at the operative time is not more than the family law value or the scheme value.

    * Immediate annuity if operative time in payment phase

    * (2) If, at the operative time, standard allowance or annuity is payable in respect of the original interest, then the nonmember spouse is entitled to an associate immediate annuity from the operative time, at the rate calculated under the Orders by reference to the transfer amount.

    * Deferred annuity if operative time in growth phase

    * (3) If, at the operative time, standard allowance or annuity is not payable in respect of the original interest, then the nonmember spouse is entitled to an associate deferred annuity in accordance with section 22CE.

##### 22CE  Associate deferred annuity

    * (1) The associate deferred annuity is payable at an annual rate calculated under the Orders by reference to the transfer amount.

    * (2) The annuity is payable from the later of:

      * (a) the operative time; and

      * (b) the earliest of the following dates:

       * (i) if the Trust is satisfied that the nonmember spouse has become permanently incapacitated--the date that the Trust considers to have been the date on which the person became permanently incapacitated;

       * (ii) a date notified to the Secretary under subsection (3);

       * (iii) the 65th anniversary of the nonmember spouse's birth.

    * (3) The nonmember spouse may give a written notice to the Secretary specifying a date that is not earlier than the 55th anniversary of the nonmember spouse's birth. However, the notice has no effect if section 26B would prevent the annuity being paid to the nonmember spouse from the specified date.

        * Note: Section 26B applies the preservation requirements of the Superannuation Industry (Supervision) Regulations.

    * (4) The annuity is not payable unless:

      * (a) a written application has been made requesting payment of the benefit; and

      * (b) the applicant has provided any information that is necessary to determine whether the benefit is payable.

    * (5) An application for payment on the ground of incapacity must be accompanied by the following:

      * (a) a certificate given by a medical practitioner nominated by the Trust;

      * (b) a certificate given by a medical practitioner nominated by, or on behalf of, the nonmember spouse;

      * (c) such additional information or documents as the Trust requires.

    * (6) The certificates mentioned in paragraphs (5)(a) and (b) must include a statement to the effect that, in the opinion of the medical practitioner concerned, the nonmember spouse is permanently incapacitated, as defined in this section.

    * (7) If the nonmember spouse dies before the annuity becomes payable, an amount calculated under the Orders must be paid to the legal personal representative or, if no legal personal representative can be found, to any individual or individuals that the Trust determines.

    * (8) For the purposes of this section, a person is **_permanently incapacitated_** if, and only if, the person suffers from **_permanent incapacity_** within the meaning of the _Superannuation Industry (Supervision) Regulations 1994_.

##### 22CF  Commutation of small associate annuity

    * (1) If:

      * (a) the annual rate of associate immediate annuity that becomes payable to the nonmember spouse is less than the amount determined under the Orders; or

      * (b) the annual rate of associate deferred annuity that becomes payable to the nonmember spouse is less than the amount determined under the Orders;

    * then the nonmember spouse may elect to commute the annuity.

    * (2) The election must be made in writing to the Secretary not later than 3 months after the annuity becomes payable.

    * (3) If the nonmember spouse makes the election, then the nonmember spouse is entitled instead to:

      * (a) if paragraph (1)(a) applies--a lump sum equal to the transfer amount; or

      * (b) if paragraph (1)(b) applies--a lump sum calculated under the Orders.

#### Division 3--Reduction of benefits for member spouse

##### 22CG  Operative time during growth phase--reduction of lump sum

    * (1) This section applies if:

      * (a) at the operative time, standard allowance or annuity is not payable in respect of the original interest; and

      * (b) the original interest is not an entitlement to an associate annuity.

    * where: 

    * **_contributions at OT_** means the amount of the contributions, ascertained at the operative time.

        * Note: Under subsections 20A(2) and 22Q(3), certain amounts are deemed to be contributions (in addition to contributions under Part IV).

    * (3) Any section 16A amount in respect of the original interest is reduced, with effect from the operative time, by the amount calculated using the formula:

    * where: 

    * **_section 16A amount at OT_** means the section 16A amount, ascertained at the operative time.

    * (4) Any section 22Q amount in respect of the original interest is reduced, with effect from the operative time, by the amount calculated using the formula:

    * where: 

    * **_section 22Q amount at OT_** means the section 22Q amount, ascertained at the operative time.

##### 22CH  Operative time during growth phase--reduction of retiring allowance

    * (1) This section applies if:

      * (b) after the operative time, a retiring allowance (the **_affected benefit_**) becomes payable to the member spouse in respect of the original interest.

        * Note: If the member spouse dies before becoming entitled to a retiring allowance, then subsection (1) will nevertheless result in an indirect reduction of any annuity under paragraph 19(1)(a) to a surviving spouse. This happens because the amount of that annuity is based on the amount of retiring allowance that would have become payable to the member spouse if he or she had not died.

    * Reduction of basic percentage

    * (2) In calculating the annual rate of the affected benefit, the applicable basic percentage is replaced by the percentage calculated using the formula:

    * where: 

    * **_BSF at OT_** means the basic service factor at the operative time.

     * **_BSF at PT_** means the basic service factor at the payment time.

    * Reduction of additional percentage

    * (3) In calculating the annual rate of the affected benefit, each applicable additional percentage is replaced by the percentage calculated using the formula:

    * where: 

    * **_ASF at OT_** means the additional service factor at the operative time for the office concerned.

    * **_ASF at PT_** means the additional service factor at the payment time for the office concerned.

    * (4) Subsection (3) does not apply to an applicable additional percentage for an office if:

      * (a) the period of service in the office began after the operative time; and

      * (b) paragraph 18(10B)(b) does not apply.

    * Multiple interest splits for same original interest

    * (5) If, before the affected benefit becomes payable, the original interest has been split more than once (that is to say, section 22CD has applied more than once), then the calculations under subsections (2) and (3) are modified as set out in subsections (6) and (7).

        * Note: If the same superannuation interest is subject to 2 or more payment splits, then section 22CD applies separately in relation to each of those splits.

    * (6) In applying the formula in subsection (2), the component (BSF at OT  Transfer factor) is to be replaced by the number calculated using the following steps, based on the chronological order of the operative times (starting with the earliest):

      * (a) calculate a factor (the **_interim factor_**) for the first split using the formula:

      * (b) calculate a factor (the **_interim factor_**) for the next split (the **_current split_**), using the formula:

      * (c) calculate a factor for each remaining split (if any), using the formula in paragraph (b);

      * (d) add together the factors calculated under paragraphs (a) to (c).

        * Example: Assume 2 splits, with the first split having a basic service factor (BSF) of 0.4 and a transfer factor of 0.5 and the second split having a basic service factor of 0.6 and a transfer factor of 0.5. Applying the above steps, the replacement number for the formula is 0.4, that is:

    * (7) In applying the formula in subsection (3), the component (ASF at OT  Transfer factor) is to be replaced by the number calculated using the following steps, based on the chronological order of the operative times (starting with the earliest):

      * (a) calculate a factor (the **_interim factor_**) for the first split using the formula:

      * (b) calculate a factor (the **_interim factor_**) for the next split (the **_current split_**), using the formula:

      * (c) calculate a factor for each remaining split (if any), using the formula in paragraph (b);

      * (d) add together the factors calculated under paragraphs (a) to (c).

    * Reduction not to affect later nonstandard annuity

    * (8) A reduction under this section is to be disregarded in calculating the amount of any nonstandard annuity that later becomes payable.

        * Note: For example, the reduction will be disregarded in calculating the amount of annuity payable under section 19AA in respect of a child of the member spouse after the member spouse's death.

##### 22CI  Operative time during growth phase--reduction where original interest is entitlement to associate deferred annuity

    * (1) This section applies if:

      * (a) at the operative time, standard allowance or annuity is not payable in respect of the original interest; and

      * (b) the original interest is an entitlement to an associate deferred annuity.

    * (2) The annual rate of that associate annuity (when it becomes payable) is reduced to the amount calculated under the Orders.

        * Note: Although an associate immediate annuity becomes payable at the operative time, an associate deferred annuity will often not become payable until some time after the operative time.

##### 22CJ  Operative time during payment phase--reduction of standard allowance or annuity

    * (1) If, at the operative time, standard allowance or annuity is payable in respect of the original interest, then the annual rate of that allowance or annuity is reduced to the amount calculated under the Orders.

    * (2) A reduction under subsection (1) is to be disregarded in calculating the amount of any nonstandard annuity that later becomes payable.

        * Note: For example, the reduction will be disregarded in calculating the amount of annuity payable under section 19AA in respect of a child of the member spouse after the member spouse's death.

#### Division 4--Miscellaneous

##### 22CK  Ministerial Orders

    * (1) The Minister may, by legislative instrument, make Orders prescribing matters required or permitted by this Part to be prescribed.

      * (a) the person's surcharge debt account is not in debit; or

      * (b) subsection (2) applies.

        * Note: The purpose of the release authority is to allow a lump sum to be paid to the Commissioner to meet a debt the person has under Subdivision 133C in Schedule 1 to the _Taxation Administration Act 1953_.

    * Surcharge election must be made or forgone

    * (2) This subsection applies if any of the following are satisfied:

    * (2) For the purpose of subsection (1), the effect of a release authority lump sum on the amount of the person's retiring allowance is to be worked out after taking account of:

      * (a) the amount of any surcharge adjustment applicable in relation to the person's retiring allowance under a provision of this Act; and

       * (i) parliamentary allowance payable to a member;

       * (ii) salary payable to a Minister of State in respect of an office;

       * (iii) allowance by way of salary payable to an office holder in respect of that office; and

      * (b) at a time after the decrease, retiring allowance is payable to a person, or would have been payable to a person if he or she had not died, who was receiving the underlying payment at a time before the decrease;

    * this section applies for the purposes of calculating the rate of the retiring allowance after the decrease. The rate of the underlying payment immediately before the decrease is the **_preserved rate_**.

    * (2) In calculating the rate of the retiring allowance, the rate of the underlying payment is to be taken to remain at the preserved rate until the actual rate of the payment increases to at least the preserved rate.

    * (3) If the actual rate of the underlying payment is further decreased before increasing to at least the preserved rate, this section does not apply separately in relation to that further decrease.

    * (4) If a decrease of a payment is expressed to have effect from a particular time before the taking of the decision to decrease the payment, this section applies as if the payment had actually been decreased at that earlier time.

    * (5) To avoid doubt, if:

      * (a) a determination under subsection 7(1A) or (1B) of the _Remuneration Tribunal Act 1973_; and

      * (b) a determination under subsection 7(1) of that Act;
