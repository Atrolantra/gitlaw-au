Article 5

Business profits

1.	For the purposes of the taxation law of each Contracting State, the business profits or losses of a person, other than an individual, derived from, or incurred in, the JPDA in a year shall be reduced by the reduction percentage.

    * 2.	(a)	Business profits or losses derived from the JPDA in a year by an individual who is a resident of a Contracting State may be taxed in both Contracting States as reduced by the reduction percentage.

    * (b) Notwithstanding subparagraph 2(a), the Contracting State of which the individual is a resident may tax those profits or recognise those losses without such reduction. In such a case, that Contracting State shall provide a tax offset against the tax payable on those profits by the individual in that State for the tax paid in the other Contracting State.

3.	Business profits derived from the JPDA in a year by an individual who is not a resident of either Contracting State may be taxed in both Contracting States but subject to a rebate entitlement against the tax payable in each Contracting State of the reduction percentage of the gross tax payable on those profits in that Contracting State.

4.	Business losses, incurred in the JPDA in a year by an individual who is not a resident of either Contracting State, that are eligible under the law of a Contracting State to be carried forward for deduction against future income shall, for the purposes of that law, be reduced by the reduction percentage.

5.	Where losses are brought forward from prior years as a deduction, those losses may not also be taken into account when calculating the business profits or business losses for the year in which they are brought forward as a deduction.

6.	Where profits include items of income which are dealt with separately in other Articles of this Taxation Code or where losses are dealt with separately in other Articles of this Taxation Code, then the provisions of those Articles shall not be affected by the provisions of this Article.

7.	In establishing whether business profits are derived from the JPDA for the purposes of this Article, regard is to be had to internationally accepted principles on the source of business profits, particularly taking into consideration the extent to which activities in the JPDA, or assets located in the JPDA, rather than elsewhere, contributed to those business profits. In applying such internationally accepted principles special regard shall be had to the location of:

    * (a) any activities or functions contributing to the business profits;

    * (b) any assets relevant to the derivation of the business profits; and

    * (c) any business and financial risks assumed by an entity and which relate to the business profits.

8.	For the purposes of paragraph 7, particular account should be had to the terms of any relevant unitisation agreement to the extent to which they do not conflict with the internationally accepted principles referred to in that paragraph.

9.	In determining whether business losses are incurred in the JPDA, regard is to be had to internationally accepted principles as to where business losses are incurred, with a view to an approach consistent with paragraphs 7 and 8 of this Article.

10.	Where particular business profits are derived wholly or principally from the JPDA, or particular business losses are incurred wholly or principally in the JPDA, then such profits or losses shall be treated as fully derived from or fully incurred in, as the case may be, the JPDA. In other cases, the relevant proportion should be attributed to the JPDA. In the application of this paragraph the Contracting States shall seek a consistent approach, including as between the treatment of profits and losses, and should consult if necessary to this end.

11.	For the purposes of this Taxation Code, the East Timor additional profits tax shall be regarded as a tax on business profits.

Notwithstanding any other provisions of this Taxation Code, where a company which is a resident of a Contracting State derives profits, income or gains from the JPDA, such profits, income or gains may be subject in the other Contracting State to a tax on profits after income tax in accordance with its law, but such tax shall not exceed fifteen (15) per cent of the gross amount of such profits, income or gains after deducting from those profits, income or gains the income tax imposed on them in that other State.
