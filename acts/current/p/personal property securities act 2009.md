### An Act relating to personal property securities, and for related purposes

## Chapter 1--Introduction

### Part 1.1--Preliminary

##### 1  Short title

     * This Act may be cited as the _Personal Property Securities Act 2009_.

##### 2  Commencement

     * This Act commences on the day after it receives the Royal Assent.

##### 3  Guide to this Act

     * _Overview_

     * _This Act is a law about security interests in personal property.

     * A security interest is an interest in personal property provided for by a transaction that secures payment or the performance of an obligation. The form of the transaction and the identity of the person who has title to the property do not affect whether an interest is a security interest.

     * Personal property includes many different kinds of tangible and intangible property, other than real property. Examples include motor vehicles, household goods, business inventory, intellectual property and company shares. Personal property is known as collateral if it is (or is anticipated to be) the subject of a security interest.

     * A security interest is enforceable against a grantor when it attaches to collateral. A security interest attaches to collateral when a person gives value for acquiring the security interest (or does something else to acquire it), and in return, the person gains rights in the collateral.

     * A security interest is enforceable against third parties when it has attached to the collateral and either the secured party has possession or control of the collateral, or a security agreement covers the collateral.

     * If a security interest in collateral is perfected, it takes priority over another security interest that is unperfected when the security interest comes to be enforced. A security interest is perfected if:

         * (a) it has attached to collateral; and

         * (b) it is enforceable against third parties; and

         * (c) certain extra steps (possession or control of the collateral, or registration on the Register of Personal Property Securities) have been taken to protect the interest.

     * Certain security interests are also declared to be temporarily perfected, or perfected, under this Act.

     * The secured party whose security interest has the highest priority is entitled to enforce that interest ahead of secured parties with security interests that have a lower priority.

     * Between perfected security interests, perfection by control has a higher priority than other forms of perfection. The next level of priority is given (subject to certain rules) to perfected purchase money security interests. If no other way of working out priority between perfected interests is provided, the highest priority is given to the security interest that has been continuously perfected for the longest period.

     * The Register of Personal Property Securities enables secured parties to give notice of actual or prospective security interests. Notice is given by the recording of data about secured parties, grantors and collateral. The register may be kept electronically, for example in a form that is interactive and accessible over the internet.

     * _Summary_

     * _Chapter 1 deals with some preliminary matters, including the general application of the Act (Part 1.2) and its interpretation (Part 1.3).

     * Chapter 2 sets out general rules relating to security interests. These include the following:

         * (a) general principles relating to security agreements, security interests, attachment and perfection (Part 2.2);

         * (b) interpretation provisions about possession and control (Part 2.3);

         * (c) rules about when attachment and perfection of security interests occurs in particular situations (Part 2.4);

         * (d) the circumstances in which personal property is taken free of a security interest in the property (Part 2.5);

         * (e) how to work out the priority between competing security interests (and in some cases, other sorts of interests) in personal property (Part 2.6);

         * (f) rules about the transfer of interests in collateral (Part 2.7).

     * Chapter 3 contains specific rules about the following: 

         * (a) agricultural interests (Part 3.2);

         * (b) security interests in accessions to personal property and their priority (Part 3.3);

         * (c) security interests in personal property that is processed or commingled and their priority (Part 3.4);

         * (d) intellectual property and intellectual property licences (Part 3.5).

     * Chapter 4 deals with how to enforce a security interest in personal property. Parties can contract out of some of the provisions of Chapter 4.

     * Chapter 5 provides for the establishment and maintenance of a register with respect to personal property securities and certain prescribed personal property (the Register of Personal Property Securities).

     * The Registrar of Personal Property Securities is responsible for maintaining the register. Chapter 5 also deals with how the register can be searched, and how certain nonregistered data can be provided through the register (as a portal).

     * A search by reference to the details of an individual grantor must be made for an authorised purpose set out in the Act. A person who carries out an unauthorised search, or uses data from an unauthorised search, may be liable to pay compensation or a civil penalty (or both).

     * Chapter 6 deals with the role of the courts in proceedings that relate to security interests in personal property. It confers jurisdiction on courts and provides rules for the transfer of proceedings between courts. It also describes the Registrar's role in judicial proceedings and contains provisions about proceedings for contravention of a civil penalty provision.

     * Chapter 7 deals with how this Act interacts with foreign laws, the constitutional operation of this Act and the relationship between this Act and other Australian laws.

     * Chapter 8 deals with the following: 

         * (a) rules about the vesting of certain unperfected interests (Part 8.2);

         * (b) rights to damages and compensation in relation to contraventions of this Act (Part 8.3);

         * (c) requests to secured parties for information, how notices may be given and certain other procedural and administrative matters (Parts 8.4 to 8.7).

     * Chapter 9 deals with the initial application of this Act.

     * The Act starts to apply under Part 9.3 at the registration commencement time, which is 1 February 2012 (the first day of the month that is 26 months after this Act was given the Royal Assent), or another time determined by the Minister.

     * Chapter 9 also deals with references to charges and fixed and floating charges in this Act and in security agreements, and provides for the review of the operation of the Act within 3 years after it starts to apply.

### Part 1.3--Definitions

#### Division 1--Introduction

##### 9  Guide to this Part

     * This Part is about the terms that are defined in this Act.

     * Division 2 contains the Dictionary. The Dictionary is a list of every term defined in this Act. A term will either be defined in the Dictionary itself, or in another provision of this Act. If another provision defines the term, the Dictionary will have a signpost to that definition.

     * Division 3 contains some longer definitions. These include the definition of **_security interest_** (in section 12).

     * A security interest is an interest in personal property provided for by a transaction that secures payment or the performance of an obligation. The form of the transaction and the identity of the person who has title to the property do not affect whether an interest is a security interest. Certain transactions that do not secure payment or the performance of an obligation may also give rise to a security interest: transfers of accounts, consignments and certain longterm leases and bailments (called PPS leases).

## Chapter 2--General rules relating to security interests

### Part 2.1--Guide to this Chapter

##### 16  Guide to this Chapter

     * This Chapter sets out general rules relating to security interests in personal property.

     * Part 2.2 contains some general principles relating to these security interests, the agreements that govern them and their enforceability. The Part describes how a security interest is attached to personal property and perfected.

     * Part 2.3 deals with the concepts of possession and control of personal property.

     * Part 2.4 contains some rules about attachment and perfection of security interests in particular situations.

     * Part 2.5 sets out circumstances in which a person takes an interest in personal property free of a security interest in the property.

     * Part 2.6 sets out how to work out the priority between competing security interests (and in some cases, other sorts of interests) in personal property. If a specific rule does not deal with the priority between security interests, then the priority is determined in accordance with the default rules in section 55.

     * Part 2.7 contains some rules about transferring and assigning interests in collateral.

### Part 2.2--Security interests: general principles

##### 17  Guide to this Part

     * This Part sets out some general principles about security interests.

     * These principles relate to the enforceability of security agreements against grantors of security interests and third parties.

     * A security interest is only effective if it has **_attached_** to collateral. A security interest attaches to collateral when the grantor has rights in the collateral, or can transfer it to the secured party, and value is given, or the security interest otherwise arises.

     * A security interest is only enforceable against a third party if it has attached to collateral and the secured party possesses the collateral, has perfected the security interest by controlling the collateral or has entered into a written security agreement that describes the collateral.

     * This Part also contains rules about how a security interest is perfected and how it is continuously perfected. A perfected security interest has priority over an unperfected security interest, and the security interest that has been continuously perfected for the longest time generally has the highest priority (see Part 2.6 for priority rules).

     * Perfection occurs when a security interest has attached to collateral and any further steps needed to make the security interest effective against third parties have been taken.

     * These steps involve registration on the Personal Property Securities Register or possession or control of the collateral. In certain situations this Act provides for perfection, or temporary perfection, by the operation of the Act itself.

##### 18  General rules about security agreements and security interests

     * (1) A security agreement is effective according to its terms.

     * (2) A security agreement may provide for security interests in afteracquired property.

     * (3) A security interest in afteracquired property attaches without specific appropriation by the grantor.

     * (4) A security agreement may provide for future advances.

     * (5) A security interest is taken to secure reasonable expenses in relation to the enforcement of the security interest, unless the parties agree otherwise.

##### 19  Enforceability of security interests against grantors--attachment

     * Attachment required for enforceability

     * (1) A security interest is enforceable against a grantor in respect of particular collateral only if the security interest has attached to the collateral.

     * Attachment rule

     * (2) A security interest **_attaches_** to collateral when:

      * (a) the grantor has rights in the collateral, or the power to transfer rights in the collateral to the secured party; and

      * (b) either:

       * (i) value is given for the security interest; or

       * (ii) the grantor does an act by which the security interest arises.

     * Time of attachment

     * (3) Subsection (2) does not apply if the parties to a security agreement have agreed that a security interest attaches at a later time, in which case the security interest **_attaches_** at the time specified in the agreement.

     * (4) To avoid doubt, a reference in a security agreement to a floating charge is not a reference to an agreement that the security interest created by the floating charge attaches at a time later than provided under subsection (2).

     * Goods leased, bailed, consigned or sold under a conditional sale agreement.

     * (5) For the purposes of paragraph (2)(a), a grantor has rights in goods that are leased or bailed to the grantor under a PPS lease, consigned to the grantor, or sold to the grantor under a conditional sale agreement (including an agreement to sell subject to retention of title) when the grantor obtains possession of the goods.

     * (6) Subsection (5) does not limit any other rights the grantor may have in the goods.

         * Note: A security interest may attach to crops while they are growing, and to the products of livestock, before they become proceeds of the crops or livestock (for example, wool before it is shorn). See subsections 31(4) and (5) (meaning of **_proceeds_**) and section 84A (security interests in crops and livestock).

##### 20  Enforceability of security interests against third parties

     * General rule

     * (1) A security interest is enforceable against a third party in respect of particular collateral only if:

      * (a) the security interest is attached to the collateral; and

      * (b) one of the following applies:

       * (i) the secured party possesses the collateral;

       * (ii) the secured party has perfected the security interest by control;

       * (iii) a security agreement that provides for the security interest covers the collateral in accordance with subsection (2).

         * Note: For possession and control of collateral, see Part 2.3.

     * Written security agreements

     * (2) A security agreement covers collateral in accordance with this subsection if:

      * (a) the security agreement is evidenced by writing that is:

       * (i) signed by the grantor (see subsection (3)); or

       * (ii) adopted or accepted by the grantor by an act, or omission, that reasonably appears to be done with the intention of adopting or accepting the writing; and

      * (b) the writing evidencing the agreement contains:

       * (i) a description of the particular collateral, subject to subsections (4) and (5); or

       * (ii) a statement that a security interest is taken in all of the grantor's present and afteracquired property; or

       * (iii) a statement that a security interest is taken in all of the grantor's present and afteracquired property except specified items or classes of personal property.

     * Methods of signing writing

     * (3) Without limiting subparagraph (2)(a)(i), for the purposes of that subparagraph a grantor is taken to sign writing if, with the intention of identifying the grantor and adopting, or accepting, the writing, the person applies:

      * (a) writing (including a symbol) executed or otherwise adopted by the person; or

      * (b) writing wholly or partly encrypted, or otherwise processed, by the person.

         * Note: For the meaning of **_writing_**, see section 10.

     * Personal property descriptions--consumer property, equipment and inventory

     * (4) If particular personal property is described using the term "consumer property" or "commercial property" in the writing evidencing a security agreement, subparagraph (2)(b)(i) is satisfied only if the personal property is more particularly described, in addition, by reference to item or class.

     * (5) If particular personal property is described using the term "inventory" in the writing evidencing a security agreement, subparagraph (2)(b)(i) is satisfied only while the personal property is held or leased by the grantor as inventory.

     * Proceeds

     * (6) A security interest in proceeds is enforceable against a third party whether or not the security agreement providing for the security interest contains a description of the proceeds.

         * Note: Section 32 deals with whether a security interest in collateral attaches to proceeds of the collateral.

##### 21  Perfection--main rule

     * (1) A security interest in particular collateral is **_perfected_** if:

      * (a) the security interest is temporarily perfected, or otherwise perfected, by force of this Act; or

       * (i) the security interest is attached to the collateral;

       * (ii) the security interest is enforceable against a third party;

       * (iii) subsection (2) applies.

     * (2) This subsection applies if:

       * (i) an ADI account;

       * (ii) an intermediated security;

       * (iii) an investment instrument;

       * (iv) a negotiable instrument that is not evidenced by a certificate;

       * (v) a right evidenced by a letter of credit that states that the letter of credit must be presented on claiming payment or requiring the performance of an obligation;

       * (vi) satellites and other space objects.

         * Note: For what constitutes possession and control of collateral, see Part 2.3.

     * (3) A security interest may be perfected regardless of the order in which attachment and any step mentioned in subsection (2) occur.

     * (4) A single registration may perfect one or more security interests.

##### 22  Perfection--goods possessed by a bailee

     * Perfection of security interest

     * (1) A security interest that has attached to goods in the possession of a bailee (other than the grantor or the debtor) is perfected if any of the following applies, regardless of when the security interest attached to the goods:

      * (a) the security interest is perfected by registration, as provided by section 21;

### Part 2.4--Attachment and perfection: specific rules

#### Division 1--Introduction

##### 30  Guide to this Part

     * This Part contains rules about when attachment and perfection (including, in some circumstances, temporary perfection) of security interests occurs in particular situations.

     * Division 2 deals with security interests in the proceeds of collateral, and in collateral after it is transferred.

     * Proceeds of collateral are identifiable or traceable personal property that is derived from dealings with the collateral. Proceeds also includes certain insurance or indemnity rights, payments in redemption of certain intangible collateral, certain rights of licensors of intellectual property, and certain rights relating to investment instruments and intermediated securities.

     * A security interest in collateral continues in the proceeds (except in certain cases). Division 2 also includes some other rules about the perfection of such interests and their enforcement. Special provisions are made for the perfection and temporary perfection of security interests in proceeds, and for the temporary perfection of security interests in collateral after it is transferred.

     * Division 3 deals with the perfection (and temporary perfection) of security interests in goods that are returned to the grantor or the debtor. After goods are returned for certain dealings (for example, sale or exchange), a security interest in the goods that had previously been perfected otherwise than by registration may be temporarily perfected for 5 business days. The same period of temporary perfection is provided in similar circumstances if possession or control of a negotiable instrument or investment instrument is returned to the grantor or debtor.

     * If goods are taken free of a security interest, but are repossessed by the grantor or debtor, the security interest reattaches to the goods, and (if the security interest had been perfected by registration) the perfection status of the security interest is unaffected.

     * Division 3 also provides special rules for the attachment and perfection of a security interest in goods if a sale or lease of the goods creates an account or chattel paper that is transferred to another person.

     * Division 4 deals with situations where collateral or a grantor of a security interest is relocated from a foreign jurisdiction to Australia. The security interest in the collateral is temporarily perfected if certain conditions are met.

#### Division 2--Proceeds and transfer

##### 31  Meaning of proceeds

     * (1) In this Act:

     * **_proceeds_** of collateral to which a security interest is (or is to be) attached means identifiable or traceable personal property of the following types, subject to subsections (2) and (3):

      * (a) personal property that is derived directly or indirectly from a dealing with the collateral (or proceeds of the collateral);

      * (b) a right to an insurance payment or other payment as indemnity or compensation for loss of, or damage to, the collateral (or proceeds of the collateral);

      * (c) a payment made in total or partial discharge or redemption of the collateral (or proceeds of the collateral), if the collateral (or proceeds) consists of any of the following:

       * (i) chattel paper;

       * (ii) intangible property;

       * (iii) an investment instrument;

       * (iv) an intermediated security;

       * (v) a negotiable instrument;

      * (d) if the collateral is intellectual property (or an intellectual property licence)--in addition to any other proceeds, the right of a licensor of the property (whether or not the property is itself a licence) to receive payments under any licence agreement in relation to the collateral;

      * (e) if the collateral is an investment instrument or intermediated security--any of the following:

       * (i) rights arising out of the collateral;

       * (ii) property collected on the collateral;

       * (iii) property distributed on account of the collateral.

         * Note: In section 140 (distribution of proceeds received by secured party) proceeds has its ordinary meaning, so this definition does not apply.

     * Whether proceeds are traceable

     * (2) Proceeds are traceable whether or not there is a fiduciary relationship between the person who has a security interest in the proceeds, as provided in section 32, and the person who has rights in or has dealt with the proceeds.

     * Restriction to proceeds in which grantor has a transferable interest

     * (3) However, personal property is **_proceeds_** only if:

      * (a) either:

       * (i) the grantor has an interest in the proceeds; or

       * (ii) the grantor has the power to transfer rights in the proceeds to the secured party (or to a person nominated by the secured party); and

      * (b) the interest in the proceeds does not arise because of the operation of paragraph 140(2)(f).

          * Note: Paragraph 140(2)(f) provides for the distribution of an amount or proceeds to the grantor upon the enforcement of a security interest.

     * Crops and livestock

     * (4) The **_proceeds_** of collateral that is crops include the harvested produce of the crops, if the produce is identifiable or traceable.

     * (5) The **_proceeds _**of collateral that is livestock include products of the livestock (for example, meat or wool), if the products are identifiable or traceable.

     * (6) However, livestock are not the **_proceeds_** of collateral merely because they are the unborn young, or the offspring, of livestock that are collateral.

##### 32  Proceeds--attachment

     * Continuation of security interest in collateral, and attachment to proceeds

     * (1) Subject to this Act, if collateral gives rise to proceeds (by being dealt with or otherwise), the security interest:

      * (a) continues in the collateral, unless:

       * (i) the secured party expressly or impliedly authorised a disposal giving rise to the proceeds; or

       * (ii) the secured party expressly or impliedly agreed that a dealing giving rise to the proceeds would extinguish the security interest; and

      * (b) attaches to the proceeds, unless the security agreement provides otherwise.

         * Note 1: The effect of paragraph (a) is to extinguish the security interest in the collateral if the secured party expressly or impliedly authorised the dealing mentioned.

         * Note 2: A transferee can also take the collateral free of the security interest because of the operation of another provision of this Act (for example, under Part 2.5).

     * Enforcement of security interest against collateral and proceeds

     * (2) If the secured party enforces a security interest against both collateral (other than an investment instrument or an intermediated security) and proceeds, the amount secured by the security interest in the collateral and proceeds is limited to the market value of the collateral immediately before the collateral gave rise to the proceeds.

         * Note: For the enforceability of a security interest against a third party in relation to proceeds, see also subsection 20(6).

     * (3) However, subsection (2) does not apply if, at the time of the transfer of the collateral, the transferee has actual or constructive knowledge that the transfer was in breach of a security agreement that provides for the security interest in the collateral.

     * (4) To avoid doubt, subsection (2) does not affect any right the secured party may have to recover the amount secured without enforcing the security interest.

     * Priority of proceeds

     * (5) For the purposes of section 55 (default priority rules), the time of registration or possession in relation to original collateral, or the time of perfection of a security interest in original collateral, is also the time of registration, possession or perfection in relation to the proceeds of the original collateral.

         * Note: The effect of subsection (5) is that the security interest in the proceeds has the same default priority as the security interest in the original collateral.

##### 33  Proceeds--perfection and temporary perfection

     * Perfection by reference to perfection of security interest in original collateral

     * (1) A security interest in proceeds is perfected if the security interest in the original collateral is perfected by a registration that:

      * (a) describes the proceeds, if the description complies with any regulations made for the purposes of paragraph (d) of item 4 of the table in section 153 (financing statements with respect to security interests); or

      * (b) covers the original collateral, if the proceeds are of a kind that are within the description of the original collateral; or

      * (c) covers the original collateral, if the proceeds consist of currency, cheques or an ADI account, or a right to an insurance payment or any other payment as indemnity or compensation for loss or damage to the collateral or proceeds.

     * Temporary perfection in other situations 

     * (2) If a security interest in original collateral is perfected, but a security interest in the proceeds is not perfected under subsection (1), the security interest in the proceeds is temporarily perfected for the period starting at the time the security interest in the original collateral attaches to the proceeds and ending at the end of 5 business days afterwards.

     * (3) However, the security interest in the proceeds under subsection (2) becomes unperfected at the end of the period mentioned in that subsection, unless the security interest in the proceeds is perfected otherwise than under the subsection before the end of the period.

##### 34  Transferred collateral--temporary perfection after transfer

     * Security interest is temporarily perfected

     * (1) If collateral is transferred, and at the time of the transfer a secured party held a perfected security interest in the collateral, the security interest is temporarily perfected for the period starting at the time of the transfer and ending at the earliest of the following times:

      * (a) the end of the month that is 24 months after the time of the transfer;

      * (b) if the security interest was perfected by registration at the time of the transfer--the end time for the registration (as registered at the time of the transfer);

      * (c) if another security interest attaches to the collateral at or after the time of the transfer, and the other security interest is perfected:

       * (i) in a case in which the original secured party consented to the transfer--the end of 5 business days after the day of the transfer; or

       * (ii) in a case in which the original secured party otherwise acquires the actual or constructive knowledge required to perfect the original secured party's interest by registration (or to reperfect the interest by an amendment of a registration)--the end of 5 business days after the day the original secured party acquires the knowledge.

         * Note: The knowledge required is the knowledge of the transferee's (the new grantor's) details. Unless these are registered, the original secured party's registration may be ineffective under section 165.

     * Security interest becomes unperfected

     * (2) However, the security interest becomes unperfected immediately after the earliest time mentioned in subsection (1), unless, at or before that time, the security interest is perfected otherwise than under subsection (1).

     * Transfer free of security interest

     * (3) This section does not apply in relation to a transfer of collateral if the transferee takes the collateral free of the security interest.

     * Reattachment of security interest

     * (1) If a grantor or debtor sells or leases goods that are subject to a security interest, and the buyer or lessee takes the goods free of the security interest because of the operation of this Act, the security interest reattaches to the goods at a particular time (the **_repossession time_**) if, at that time, the goods come into the possession of the grantor or debtor, or of a transferee of chattel paper created by the sale or lease, in any of the following circumstances:

     * Exceptions

     * (5) This section does not apply to:

      * (a) intellectual property, an intellectual property licence or an ADI account; or

### Part 2.5--Taking personal property free of security interests

##### 41  Guide to this Part

     * This Part is about taking personal property free of security interests.

     * Rules are set out for when personal property may be bought or leased free of a security interest in relation to the following: 

         * (a) unperfected security interests;

         * (b) serial number defects;

         * (c) motor vehicles;

         * (d) taking in the ordinary course of business;

         * (e) personal, domestic or household property;

         * (f) currency;

         * (g) taking investment instruments or intermediated securities in the ordinary course of trading;

         * (h) investment instruments;

         * (i) intermediated securities;

     * If a transferee takes personal property (or an accession) free of a security interest by the operation of this Part, the secured party's rights are subrogated to the rights of the transferor. Payment of the purchase price before the transferee receives notice of subrogation discharges the transferee's obligation (to the extent of the payment).

### Part 2.6--Priority between security interests

#### Division 1--Introduction

##### 54  Guide to this Part

     * This Part deals with how to work out the priority between competing security interests in collateral (and in some cases, other kinds of interests).

     * Priority rules are relevant when the same personal property is subject to 2 or more security interests. If the debtor defaults, the rules determine the order of priority in which the various secured parties can enforce their security interests under Chapter 4.

     * Division 2 sets out the default rules that apply if this Act provides no other way of determining that priority.

     * Unless otherwise provided: 

         * (a) perfected interests have priority over unperfected interests; and

         * (b) priority between perfected interests amongst themselves, and unperfected interests amongst themselves, is determined on a firstintime basis.

     * The Division contains other rules of general application (such as the priority that applies to the proceeds of collateral). Security interests perfected by control have the highest priority.

     * For example, a security interest held by an ADI in an ADI account with the ADI has priority over any other security interest in the ADI account. An ADI has control over an ADI account held with the ADI (see section 25). Only the ADI with which an ADI account is held may perfect a security interest in the ADI account by control (see section 21). A security interest perfected by control has priority over any other security interest in the same collateral (see section 57).

     * Division 3 deals with the priority rules that apply when one of the security interests is a perfected purchase money security interest. These interests are exceptions to the firstintime rule (except for certain security interests in an account dealt with in section 64). A perfected purchase money security interest that is granted to a seller, lessor or consignor takes priority over a perfected purchase money security interest that is granted to others.

     * Division 4 deals with priority of security interests in transferred collateral where a transferor and a transferee have both granted security interests in the transferred collateral. Provided the transferorgranted security interest has remained perfected, that security interest will take priority.

     * Division 5 deals with the priority of certain creditors who have their debts repaid. The priority of those who purchase negotiable instruments, chattel paper and negotiable documents of title is also dealt with. Generally, the purchaser's interest will take priority over a security interest in the negotiable instrument, chattel paper or negotiable document of title.

     * Division 6 deals with priorities in relation to the following: 

         * (a) interests that arise under law;

         * (b) interests of execution creditors;

         * (c) security interests in returned goods;

         * (d) security interests in accounts, financial property or intermediated securities if a foreign law governs their perfection but does not provide for public registration.

#### Division 2--Priority of security interests generally

##### 55  Default priority rules

     * (1) This section sets out the priority between security interests in the same collateral if this Act provides no other way of determining that priority.

         * Note: For other rules about priorities, see the following:

          * (a) the remaining provisions of this Part;

          * (b) Chapter 3 (agricultural interests, accessions and commingling);

          * (c) Part 9.4 (transitional application of this Act).

     * Priority between unperfected security interests

     * (2) Priority between unperfected security interests in the same collateral is to be determined by the order of attachment of the security interests.

     * Perfected security interest has priority over unperfected security interest

     * (3) A perfected security interest in collateral has priority over an unperfected security interest in the same collateral.

     * Priority for perfection in other ways

     * (4) Priority between 2 or more security interests in collateral that are currently perfected is to be determined by the order in which the priority time (see subsection (5)) for each security interest occurs.

     * (5) For the purposes of subsection (4), the **_priority time_** for a security interest in collateral is, subject to subsection (6), the earliest of the following times to occur in relation to the security interest:

      * (a) the registration time for the collateral;

      * (b) the time the secured party, or another person on behalf of the secured party, first perfects the security interest by taking possession or control of the collateral;

      * (c) the time the security interest is temporarily perfected, or otherwise perfected, by force of this Act.

     * (6) A time is a **_priority time_** for a security interest only if, once the security interest is perfected at or after that time, the security interest remains continuously perfected.

         * Note: A security interest in the proceeds of original collateral has the same default priority as the security interest in the original collateral (see subsection 32(5)).

##### 56  How a security interest is continuously perfected 

     * (1) For the purposes of this Act, a security interest is **_continuously perfected_** after a particular time if the security interest is, after that time, perfected under this Act at all times.

     * (2) A security interest may be continuously perfected after a particular time even if, after that time, it is perfected in 2 or more different ways:

      * (a) at any particular time; or

      * (b) at different times.

         * Examples: A security interest could be perfected in 2 or more different ways as follows:

          * (a) by possession and by a registration;

          * (b) by 2 different registrations.

##### 57  Priority of security interests perfected by control

     * Priority interests

     * (1) A security interest in collateral that is currently perfected by control has priority over a security interest in the same collateral that is currently perfected by another means.

         * Note: Only security interests in certain kinds of property can be perfected by control (see paragraph 21(2)(c) and Part 2.3).

     * (2) Priority between 2 or more security interests in collateral that are currently perfected by control is to be determined by the order in which the interests were perfected by control (where the perfection by control has been continuous).

     * (2A) A perfected security interest (the **_priority interest_**) in the proceeds of original collateral has priority over any other security interest in the proceeds, except a security interest in the proceeds as original collateral that is perfected by control, if:

      * (a) the security interest in the firstmentioned original collateral was perfected by control when the collateral gave rise to proceeds; and

      * (b) the priority interest is not perfected by control.

     * Control priority takes precedence over any other priority rule

     * (3) This section applies despite the application of any other provision of this Part.

##### 58  Priority of advances

     * A security interest provided for by a security agreement has the same priority in respect of all advances (including future advances), and the performance of all obligations, secured by the agreement.

         * Note: This section is subject to section 68 (transfer of collateral that is not registered with a serial number).

##### 59  Priority rules and intervening security interests

     * A security interest (the **_first security interest_**) has priority over another security interest (the **_last security interest_**) if, by the operation of this Act (including this section):

      * (a) the first security interest has priority over security interests of a particular kind (the **_intermediate security interests_**); and

      * (b) the intermediate security interests have priority over the last security interest.

##### 60  Transfer of security interests does not affect priority

     * If a security interest in collateral is transferred, the transferred interest has the same priority immediately after the transfer as it had immediately before the transfer.

         * Note: Division 4 deals with transfer of collateral.

##### 61  Voluntary subordination of security interests

     * (1) A secured party may (in a security agreement or otherwise) subordinate the secured party's security interest in collateral to any other interest in the collateral.

     * (2) The subordination:

      * (a) is effective according to its terms between the parties; and

      * (b) may be enforced by a third party if the third party is the person, or one of a class of persons, for whose benefit the subordination is intended.

#### Division 3--Priority of purchase money security interests

##### 62  When purchase money security interests take priority over other security interests

     * Scope

     * (1) This section sets out when a perfected purchase money security interest that is granted by a grantor in collateral or its proceeds has priority over a perfected security interest that is granted by the same grantor in the same collateral, but that is not a purchase money security interest.

         * Note: This section is subject to section 57 (perfection by control).

     * Inventory

     * (2) The purchase money security interest has priority if:

      * (a) the purchase money security interest is in inventory or its proceeds; and

      * (b) the purchase money security interest is perfected by registration at the time:

       * (i) for inventory that is goods--the grantor, or another person at the request of the grantor, obtains possession of the inventory; or

       * (ii) for any other kind of inventory--the purchase money security interest attaches to the inventory; and

      * (c) the registration that perfects the purchase money security interest states, in accordance with item 7 of the table in section 153, that the interest is a purchase money security interest.

         * Note: This subsection is subject to sections 64 (nonpurchase money security interest in accounts) and 71 (chattel paper).

     * Personal property other than inventory

     * (3) The purchase money security interest has priority if:

      * (a) the interest is in personal property, or its proceeds, other than inventory; and

      * (b) the purchase money security interest is perfected by registration before the end of 15 business days after whichever of the following days applies:

       * (i) for goods--the day the grantor, or another person at the request of the grantor, obtains possession of the property;

       * (ii) for any other property--the day the interest attaches to the property; and

      * (c) the registration that perfects the purchase money security interest states, in accordance with item 7 of the table in section 153, that the interest is a purchase money security interest.

         * Note: The period mentioned in paragraph (b) may be extended by a court under section 293.

##### 63  Priority between competing purchase money security interests in collateral

     * A perfected purchase money security interest (the **_priority interest_**) that is granted by a grantor in collateral or its proceeds to a seller, lessor or consignor of the collateral has priority over any other perfected purchase money security interest that is granted by the same grantor in the same collateral if the priority interest is perfected:

      * (a) if the collateral is inventory that is goods--at the time the grantor, or another person at the request of the grantor, obtains possession of the collateral; or

      * (b) if the collateral is inventory and is not goods--at the time the priority interest attaches to the collateral; or

      * (c) if the collateral is not inventory, and is goods--before the end of 15 business days after the day the grantor, or another person at the request of the grantor, obtains possession of the collateral; or

      * (d) if the collateral is not inventory, and is not goods--before the end of 15 business days after the day the priority interest attaches to the collateral.

         * Note 1: This section is subject to section 57 (perfection by control).

         * Note 2: The periods mentioned in paragraphs (c) and (d) may be extended by a court under section 293.

##### 64  Nonpurchase money security interests in accounts

     * Nonpurchase money security interest in account as original collateral has priority over purchase money security interest in account as proceeds of inventory

     * (1) Despite subsection 62(2), a nonpurchase money security interest (the **_priority interest_**) granted for new value in an account as original collateral and perfected by registration has priority over a perfected purchase money security interest that is granted by the same grantor in the account as proceeds of inventory, if:

      * (a) the registration time in respect of the priority interest occurs before the earlier of the following times:

       * (i) the time at which the purchase money security interest is perfected;

       * (ii) the registration time in respect of the purchase money security interest; or

      * (b) both of the following conditions are met:

       * (i) the secured party holding the priority interest gives a notice in accordance with subsection (2) to the secured party holding the purchase money security interest;

       * (ii) the notice is given at least 15 business days before the earlier of the day on which the registration time for the account occurs and the day the priority interest attaches to the account.

         * Note 1: This section is subject to sections 57 (perfection by control) and 71 (chattel paper).

         * Note 2: The period mentioned in paragraph (b) may be extended by a court under section 293.

      * (a) the notice is in the approved form; or

      * (b) the notice:

       * (i) contains a description of the inventory to which the notice relates; and

       * (ii) sets out the effect of subsection (1).

     * Perfected purchase money security interest in both proceeds and new value

     * (3) If a person has a purchase money security interest in an account as proceeds of inventory that is subordinate to a nonpurchase money security interest under subsection (1):

      * (a) the person is taken to have a purchase money security interest in both the proceeds of the inventory and in the new value mentioned in subsection (1); and

      * (b) the purchase money security interest in the new value is taken to be perfected by the registration that perfected the purchase money security interest in the proceeds; and

      * (c) the new value is taken to be an account for the purposes of this Act (except for the purposes of this section or paragraph 12(3)(a) (account transferee's interest taken to be security interest)).

     * (4) However, if the new value mentioned in paragraph (3)(c) would be an account for the purposes of this Act in the absence of that paragraph, the paragraph does not prevent the new value from being an account for the purposes of this section or paragraph 12(3)(a).

##### 65  Possession of goods shipped by a common carrier

     * For the purposes of this Division, if goods are shipped by common carrier to a grantor, or to a person designated by the grantor, the grantor does not obtain possession of the goods until the grantor, or a third party at the request of the grantor, obtains actual possession of the goods or a document of title to the goods, whichever is earlier.

#### Division 4--Priority of security interests in transferred collateral

##### 66  Application of this Division

     * (1) This Division sets out the priority between 2 security interests (a transferorgranted interest and a transfereegranted interest) if:

      * (a) a grantor transfers collateral (the **_transferred collateral_**) to a transferee; and

      * (b) immediately before the transfer, a security interest (the **_transferorgranted interest_**) is attached to the collateral; and

      * (c) the transferee grants (whether before or after the transfer) a security interest (the **_transfereegranted interest_**) in the transferred collateral; and

      * (d) neither the transferorgranted interest nor the transfereegranted interest is currently perfected by control.

         * Note 1: If either or both of the interests are currently perfected by control under paragraph 21(2)(c), section 57 applies.

         * Note 2: If the priority between a transferorgranted interest and a transfereegranted interest is not covered by this section, then section 55 applies.

         * Note 4: For a grantor's rights in relation to transferring collateral, see section 79.

     * (2) This Division does not prevent a secured party from perfecting a security interest in any way in order to have priority over another security interest.

##### 67  Priority when transferorgranted interest has been continuously perfected

     * The transferorgranted interest has priority if: 

      * (a) it was perfected immediately before the transfer; and

      * (b) it has been continuously perfected since the transfer.

##### 68  Priority when there is a break in the perfection of the transferorgranted interest

     * (1) The transferorgranted interest in the transferred collateral has priority (except as mentioned in subsection (2)) if:

      * (a) the transferred collateral is not registered with a serial number (see subsection (4)); and

      * (b) the interest was perfected by registration immediately before the transfer; and

      * (c) the interest becomes unperfected; and

          * Note: See subsection 34(3) for one situation in which a security interest may become unperfected following a transfer of collateral.

      * (d) the interest is later reperfected; and

      * (e) a notice is given (whether before or after the interest is reperfected as mentioned in paragraph (d)) to all other secured parties who have a registration that describes the transferred collateral; and

      * (f) the notice is given in accordance with subsection (5); and

      * (g) the interest has been continuously perfected since it was reperfected as mentioned in paragraph (d).

     * (2) However, the transfereegranted interest has priority if:

      * (a) subsection (1) applies in relation to the transferorgranted interest; and

      * (b) the transfereegranted interest is perfected immediately before the transferorgranted security is reperfected as mentioned in paragraph (1)(d); and

      * (c) the transferee acquires the collateral without actual or constructive knowledge that the acquisition constitutes a breach of the security agreement that provides for the transferorgranted interest; and

      * (d) the transfereegranted interest secures performance of an advance made, or an obligation incurred, by the transferee's secured party before:

       * (i) the transferorgranted interest is reperfected as mentioned in paragraph (1)(d); and

      * (a) the notice is in the approved form; or

      * (b) the notice:

       * (i) states that the secured party expects to perfect a security interest in the transferred collateral; and

       * (ii) contains a description of the transferred collateral; and

#### Division 5--Priority of creditors, and purchasers of negotiable instruments, chattel paper and negotiable documents of title

##### 69  Priority of creditor who receives payment of debt

     * (1) The interest of a creditor who receives payment of a debt owing by a debtor through a payment covered by subsection (3) has priority over a security interest (whether perfected or unperfected) in:

      * (a) the funds paid; and

      * (b) the intangible that was the source of the payment; and

      * (c) a negotiable instrument used to effect the payment.

         * Example: A bank account from which the funds were paid is an example of an intangible that was the source of the payment.

##### 73  Priority between security interests and declared statutory interests

     * Interests arising under a law etc. in the ordinary course of business

     * (1) An interest (the **_priority interest_**) in collateral has priority over a security interest in the collateral if:

      * (a) the priority interest arises (by being created, arising or being provided for):

       * (i) under a law of the Commonwealth, a State or a Territory, unless the person who owns the collateral in which the priority interest is granted agrees to the interest; or

       * (ii) by operation of the general law; and

      * (b) the priority interest arises in relation to providing goods or services in the ordinary course of business; and

      * (c) the person who holds the priority interest provided those goods or services; and

      * (d) no law of the Commonwealth, a State or a Territory provides for the priority between the priority interest and the security interest; and

          *  Example: A law of the Commonwealth, a State or a Territory to which subsection (2) applies is a law that provides for the priority between the priority interest and the security interest.

      * (e) the person who holds the priority interest acquired the interest without actual knowledge that the acquisition constitutes a breach of the security agreement that provides for the security interest.

         * Note: The priority interest might be an interest to which this Act would otherwise not apply (see subsection 8(2)).

     * Statutory interests declared by law

     * (2) The priority between an interest in collateral (the **_statutory interest_**) that arises, by being created, arising or being provided for, under a law of the Commonwealth, a State or a Territory (the **_relevant jurisdiction_**) and a security interest in the same collateral is to be determined in accordance with that law if, and only if:

      * (a) that law declares that this subsection applies to statutory interests of that kind; and

      * (b) the statutory interest arises after the declaration comes into effect.

         * Note: The statutory interest might be an interest to which this Act would otherwise not apply (see subsection 8(2)).

     * (3) However, for the purposes of subsection (2), as it applies to a law of the Commonwealth:

      * (a) the Minister may, by an instrument made under subsection (4), make the declaration required by paragraph (2)(a); and

      * (b) the priority mentioned in subsection (2) may be determined in accordance with that instrument.

     * (4) The Minister may make a legislative instrument containing a declaration, or determining priority, or both, for the purposes of subsection (3).

     * (5) Subsection (2) is subject to subsection (1).

     * Rights to payment in connection with specifically identified land

     * (6) An interest (the **_priority interest_**) in collateral has priority over a security interest in the collateral if the priority interest is an interest of a kind mentioned in subparagraph 8(1)(f)(ii) (certain rights to payment in respect of land).

     * Interests arising under the general law

     * (7) The priority between an interest in collateral (the **_general law interest_**) that arises by operation of the general law and a security interest in the same collateral is to be determined in accordance with an instrument made under subsection (8) if, and only if:

      * (a) no law of the Commonwealth (other than this Act and that instrument) provides for the priority between the general law interest and the security interest; and

      * (b) the instrument provides that this subsection applies to general law interests of that kind; and

      * (c) the general law interest arises after the instrument comes into effect.

     * (8) The Minister may make a legislative instrument for the purposes of subsection (7).

     * (9) Subsection (7) is subject to subsection (1).

         * Note: This section does not apply to priorities in relation to interests that arise before the registration commencement time (within the meaning of section 306). Priorities in relation to such interests are unaffected by this Act (see section 312).

##### 74  Execution creditor has priority over unperfected security interest

     * (1) The interest of an execution creditor in collateral has priority over any security interest in the same collateral that is not perfected at the time covered by subsection (4) (even if such a security interest is later perfected).

     * **	**(2)	To avoid doubt, an execution creditor does not include a landlord who exercises a right of distress.

     * (3) This section applies despite any other section in this Part.

     * Time of seizure or execution

     * (4) This subsection covers the following times:

      * (a) if the collateral is seized by the execution creditor or by another person on behalf of the execution creditor--the time of seizure;

       * (ii) a garnishee order is made in relation to the execution creditor.

##### 75  Priority of security interests held by ADIs

     * To avoid doubt, a perfected security interest, held by an ADI, in an ADI account with the ADI has priority over any other perfected security interest in the ADI account.

         * Note 1: A security interest that is held by an ADI in an ADI account is perfected by control (see paragraph 21(2)(c) and section 25).

         * Note 2: This provision does not affect any right of setoff the grantor might have in relation to the account (see paragraph 8(1)(d)).

##### 76  Priority of security interests in returned goods

     * Security interest held by account transferee

     * (1) A perfected security interest in goods that has reattached to the property under subsection 37(1) has priority over a security interest in the goods that is granted by the operation of subsection 38(1) to a transferee of an account.

         * Note: Section 37 deals with security interests that reattach when goods are returned. Section 38 provides for a security interest in an account or chattel paper to arise automatically when goods are returned.

     * (2) A security interest in goods that is granted by the operation of subsection 38(2) to a transferee of chattel paper has priority over the following perfected security interests:

      * (a) a perfected security interest in the goods that is granted by the operation of subsection 38(2) to a transferee of an account;

      * (b) if the transferee takes possession of the chattel paper in the ordinary course of business of acquiring chattel paper of that kind and for new value:

       * (i) a perfected security interest in the goods that has reattached under subsection 37(1); or

       * (ii) a perfected security interest in the goods as afteracquired property that attaches when the goods come into the possession of the grantor or transferee in the circumstances mentioned in paragraph 37(1)(d).

     * Security interest granted by buyer or lessee

     * (3) A security interest (the **_priority interest_**) in goods that is granted by a person who acquires an interest in the property has priority over a security interest in the goods that reattaches under section 37, or is granted by the operation of section 38, if:

      * (a) the priority interest attaches while the goods are in the possession of the person; and

      * (b) immediately before the repossession time (referred to in paragraph 37(1)(d) or 38(1)(d)), the priority interest is perfected.

##### 77  Priority of certain security interests if there is no foreign register

     * Scope

     * (1) This section applies to a security interest (the **_priority interest_**) in an account, financial property or an intermediated security if the law of the jurisdiction that governs the perfection, and the effect of perfection or nonperfection, of the priority interest does not provide for the public registration or recording of the priority interest, or a notice relating to the priority interest.

         * Note: For when laws of other jurisdictions govern a security interest, see Part 7.2.

     * Security interests in accounts

     * (2) A priority interest in an account has priority, in proceedings in an Australian court, over another interest in the account (whether or not the other interest is a security interest) if the priority interest is perfected by registration under this Act before the other interest attaches to the account.

     * Security interests in financial property and intermediated securities

     * (3) A priority interest in personal property that is financial property or an intermediated security has priority, in proceedings in an Australian court, over another interest in the personal property (whether or not the other interest is a security interest) if:

      * (a) the priority interest is perfected by registration under this Act before the other interest attaches to the personal property; and

      * (b) when the other interest arises in the personal property:

       * (i) the personal property is located in Australia; and

       * (ii) the secured party does not have possession or control of the personal property.

         * Note: For when personal property is located in a jurisdiction, see section 235.

     * Relationship with sections 239 and 240

     * (4) Subsections (2) and (3) apply in proceedings in an Australian court even if the law of another jurisdiction applies in the proceedings in relation to a security interest in an account or financial property under subsection 239(2) or 240(4) or (5).

### Part 2.7--Transfer of interests in collateral

##### 78  Guide to this Part

     * This Part deals with the transfer of interests in collateral.

     * Collateral may be transferred despite a contrary provision in a security agreement (or a provision declaring the transfer to be a default), if the grantor and transferee consent, or by the operation of law.

     * The rights of a transferee of an account or chattel paper are subject to the contract between the account debtor and the transferor, and certain general law claims the account debtor may have against the transferor.

     * A modification of the contract (or a substituted contract) between the account debtor and the transferor is effective against the transferee except in certain situations (dishonesty, commercial unreasonableness or adverse effects on the transferee's rights or the transferor's ability to perform the contract).

     * A term in a contract between an account debtor and a transferor that imposes certain restrictions on the transfer of an account or chattel paper binds the transferor to the extent of making the transferor liable in damages for breach of contract, but is unenforceable against third parties.

##### 79  Transfer of collateral despite prohibition in security agreement

     * (1) If collateral would be able to be transferred (including by sale, by creating a security interest or under proceedings to enforce a judgment) but for a provision in a security agreement prohibiting the transfer or declaring the transfer to be a default, the collateral may be transferred, despite the provision:

      * (a) by consent between the grantor and the transferee; or

      * (b) by operation of law.

         * Note: See section 32 in relation to security interests in proceeds that arise as a result of a transfer.

     * (2) A transfer mentioned in subsection (1) does not prejudice the rights of the secured party under the security agreement or otherwise, including the right to treat a prohibited transfer as an act of default.

##### 80  Rights on transfer of account or chattel paper--rights of transferee and account debtor

     * Rights of transferee subject to contractual terms and defences

     * (1) The rights of a transferee of an account or chattel paper (including a secured party or a receiver) are subject to:

      * (a) the terms of the contract between the account debtor and the transferor, and any equity, defence, remedy or claim arising in relation to the contract (including a defence by way of a right of setoff); and

      * (b) any other equity, defence, remedy or claim of the account debtor against the transferor (including a defence by way of a right of setoff) that accrues before the first time when payment by an account debtor to the transferor no longer discharges the obligation of the account debtor under subsection (8) to the extent of the payment.

     * (2) Subsection (1) does not apply if the account debtor makes an enforceable agreement not to assert defences to claims arising out of the contract.

     * Effect of modification or substitution of contract on transferee

     * (3) Unless the account debtor has otherwise agreed, a modification of, or substitution for, the contract between the account debtor and the transferor is effective against the transferee (including a secured party or a receiver) if:

      * (a) the account debtor and the transferor have acted honestly in modifying or substituting the contract; and

      * (b) the manner in which the modification or the substitution is made is commercially reasonable; and

      * (c) the modification or substitution does not have a material adverse effect on:

       * (i) the transferee's rights under the contract; or

       * (ii) the transferor's ability to perform the contract.

         * Note: For the meaning of **_modification_**, see section 10.

     * (4) Subsection (3) applies:

      * (a) to the extent that a transferred right to payment arising out of the contract has not been fully earned by performance; and

      * (b) even if there has been notice of the transfer to the account debtor.

     * (5) If a contract has been modified or substituted in the manner described in subsection (3), the transferee obtains rights that correspond to the rights of the transferor under the contract as modified or substituted.

     * (6) Nothing in subsections (3) to (5) affects the validity of a term in a transfer agreement that provides that a modification or substitution mentioned in subsection (3) is a breach of contract by the transferor.

     * Payment by account debtor after transfer

     * (7) If an account or chattel paper is transferred, the account debtor may continue to make payments under the contract to the transferor:

      * (a) until the account debtor receives a notice that:

       * (i) states that the amount payable or to become payable under the contract has been transferred; and

       * (ii) states that payment is to be made to the transferee; and

       * (iii) identifies the contract (whether specifically or by class) under which the amount payable is to become payable; or

      * (b) after receiving a notice under paragraph (a) (other than a notice from the transferor), if:

       * (i) the account debtor requests the transferee to provide proof of the transfer; and

       * (ii) the transferee fails to provide proof before the end of 5 business days after the day of the request.

     * (8) Payment by an account debtor to a transferee in accordance with a notice under paragraph (7)(a) (including in the circumstances described in paragraph (7)(b)) discharges the obligation of the account debtor to the extent of the payment.

##### 81  Rights on transfer of account or chattel paper--contractual restrictions and prohibitions on transfer

     * Scope

     * (1) This section applies to a term in a contract if:

      * (a) the contract is between an account debtor and a transferor; and

      * (b) the term restricts or prohibits transfer of any of the following for currency due or to become due:

       * (i) the whole of an account that is the proceeds of inventory;

       * (ii) the whole of an account that arises from granting a right (other than a right granted under a construction contract), or providing services (other than financial services), in the ordinary course of a business of granting rights or providing services of that kind (whether or not the account debtor is the person to whom the right is granted or the services are provided);

       * (iii) the whole of an account that is the proceeds of an account mentioned in subparagraph (ii);

       * (iv) chattel paper.

     * Statutory restriction on contracts

     * (2) The term in the contract:

      * (a) is binding on the transferor, but only to the extent of making the transferor liable in damages for breach of contract; and

      * (b) is unenforceable against third parties.

         * (b) the capacity for a security interest to attach to crops while they are growing, and to the products of livestock, before the crops or products become proceeds (for example, the wool on a sheep's back before it is shorn); and

         * (c) the priority to be given to security interests in crops (and proceeds) granted to enable the crops to be produced, and security interests in livestock (and proceeds) granted to enable the livestock to be fed and developed.

     * Other provisions of this Act that deal with agricultural interests are subsections 31(4), (5) and (6) (meaning of **_proceeds_** of crops and livestock) and Division 6 of Part 4.3 (enforcement of security interests in crops and livestock).

##### 84  Relationship between security interest in crops and interest in land

     * Effect of security interest in crops on lessor or mortgagee of land

     * (1) A security interest in crops does not prejudicially affect the rights of a lessor or mortgagee of land on which the crops are growing if:

      * (a) those rights existed at the time the security interest was created; and

      * (b) the lessor or mortgagee has not consented in writing to the creation of the security interest.

     * Effect of sale etc. of land on perfected security interest in crops

     * (2) Subject to subsection (1), a perfected security interest in crops is not prejudicially affected by a subsequent sale, lease or mortgage of, or other encumbrance on, the land on which the crops are growing.

##### 84A  Attachment of security interests to crops while they are growing and to the products of livestock

     * Security interest in crops while they are growing

     * (1) To avoid doubt, a security interest may attach to crops while they are growing.

     * Security interest in the products of livestock

     * (2) To avoid doubt, a security interest may attach to the products of livestock before they become proceeds (for example, the wool on a sheep's back before the sheep is shorn).

         * Note 1: **_Livestock_** includes the products of livestock before they become proceeds (see section 10).

         * Note 2: For what are the **_proceeds _**of crops and livestock, see subsections 31(4), (5) and (6).

##### 85  Priority of crops

     * A perfected security interest (the **_priority interest_**) that is granted by a grantor in crops or the proceeds of crops has priority over any other security interest that is granted by the same grantor in the same crops or proceeds if:

      * (a) the priority interest is granted for value; and

      * (b) the priority interest is granted to enable the crops to be produced; and

      * (c) either:

       * (i) the security agreement providing for the priority interest is made while the crops are growing; or

       * (ii) the crops are planted during the period of 6 months after the day the security agreement providing for the priority interest is made.

##### 86  Priority of livestock

     * A perfected security interest (the **_priority interest_**) that is granted by a grantor in livestock or the proceeds of livestock has priority over any other security interest (other than a purchase money security interest) that is granted by the same grantor in the same livestock or proceeds if:

      * (a) the priority interest is granted for value; and

      * (b) the priority interest is granted to enable the livestock to be fed or developed; and

      * (c) either:

       * (i) the livestock are held by the grantor at the time the security agreement providing for the priority interest is made; or

       * (ii) the livestock are acquired by the grantor during the period of 6 months after the day the security agreement providing for the priority interest is made.

### Part 3.3--Accessions

##### 87  Guide to this Part

     * This Part deals with security interests in accessions to personal property.

     * A security interest in goods that become an accession to other goods continues in the accession.

     * The Part sets out the priority between an interest (whether or not a security interest) in an accession and the goods to which the accession is affixed.

     * A security interest arising in an accession before it is affixed to goods has priority over a security interest in the goods as a whole. However, there are exceptions relating to interests in the whole created after the accession is affixed and before the security interest in the accession is perfected.

     * A security interest arising in an accession after it is affixed will ordinarily be subordinate to an existing interest in the other goods (unless, for example, the holder of the existing interest agrees otherwise) and to a later interest in the other goods that arises before the interest in the accession is perfected.

     * The Part also deals with the removal of accessions by a secured party who has an interest in the accession.

##### 88  Continuation of security interests in accessions

     * A security interest in goods that become an accession to other goods continues in the accession.

         * Note: However, a person might take an interest in the accession free of the security interest because of another provision of this Act.

##### 89  Default rule--interest in accession has priority

     * Except as otherwise provided in this Act, a security interest in goods that is attached at the time when the goods become an accession has priority over a claim to the goods as an accession made by a person with an interest in the whole.

##### 90  Priority interest in whole--before security interest in accession is perfected

     * The interest of any of the following persons has priority over a security interest in goods that is attached at the time when the goods become an accession: 

      * (a) a person who acquires for value an interest in the whole after the goods become an accession, but before the security interest in the accession is perfected;

      * (b) an assignee for value of a person with an interest in the whole at the time when the goods become an accession, but before the security interest in the accession is perfected;

      * (c) a person with a perfected security interest in the whole who makes an advance under the security agreement relating to the security interest after the goods become an accession, but before the security interest in the accession is perfected, and only to the extent of the advance;

      * (d) a person with a perfected security interest in the whole who acquires the right to retain the whole in satisfaction of the obligation secured after the goods become an accession, but before the security interest in the accession is perfected.

##### 91  Priority interest in whole--security interest in accession attaches after goods become accession

     * A security interest in goods that attaches after the goods become an accession is subordinate to the interest of: 

      * (a) a person who has an interest in the other goods at the time when the goods become an accession and who:

       * (i) has not consented to the security interest in the accession; and

       * (ii) has not disclaimed an interest in the accession; and

       * (iii) has not entered into an agreement under which another person is entitled to remove the accession; and

       * (iv) is otherwise entitled to prevent the grantor from removing the accession; or

      * (b) a person who acquires an interest in the whole after the goods become an accession, but before the security interest in the accession is perfected.

##### 92  Secured party must not damage goods when removing accession

     * A secured party who is entitled to remove an accession under section 123 (seizure of collateral) must remove the accession from the whole in a manner that causes no greater damage to the other goods, or that puts the person in possession of the whole to no greater inconvenience, than is necessarily incidental to the removal of the accession.

##### 93  Reimbursement for damage caused in removing accessions

     *  		(1) A person, other than the grantor, who has an interest in the other goods at the time the goods become an accession is entitled to reimbursement for any damage to that person's interest in the other goods caused by the removal of the accession.

     * (2) Any reimbursement payable under subsection (1) does not include reimbursement for a reduction in the value of the property caused by the absence of the accession or by the necessity of the replacement of the accession.

##### 94  Refusal of permission to remove accession

     * A person entitled to reimbursement under section 93 may refuse permission to remove the accession until the secured party has given adequate security for the reimbursement.

##### 95  Secured party must give notice of removal of accession

     * Notice required to be given by secured party

     * (1) A secured party who is entitled to remove an accession from the whole must give notice of the secured party's intention to remove the accession to each of the following persons in accordance with subsections (2) and (3):

      * (a) the grantor;

      * (b) a secured party with a security interest in the accession that has a higher priority.

     * (2) The secured party must give a notice to a person:

      * (a) at least 10 business days before the day the accession is removed; or

      * (b) if the person has given a written notice to the secured party specifying a smaller number of days to apply for the purposes of this section--at least that number of days before the accession is removed.

     * (3) A notice must contain the following:

      * (a) the name of the secured party giving the notice;

      * (b) a description of the accession and of the other goods;

      * (c) a statement of the obligation owed to the secured party, and the value of the accession if the accession were removed from the other goods;

      * (d) a statement of intention to remove the accession, unless the obligation secured by the security interest in the accession is discharged, or the value of the accession is paid, before the end of the period to which subsection (2) applies.

     * (4) The notice may be given in the approved form.

     * When notice is not required

     * (5) The secured party is not required to give a notice to a person under subsection (1) if, after the debtor defaults, the person gives written consent to the secured party to remove the accession without receiving a notice.

     * (6) The secured party is not required to give a notice to any person under subsection (1) if:

      * (a) the secured party believes on reasonable grounds that the accession will decline substantially in value if it is not disposed of immediately after default; or

      * (b) the cost of expenses for the retention of the accession that are secured against the accession is disproportionately large in relation to its value.

         * Note: In addition, a secured party is not required to give a notice in any of the circumstances set out in section 144 (when certain enforcement notices are not required).

     * (7) A person is not entitled to a notice under subsection (1) in relation to an accession to goods only because the person has an interest in another accession to the same goods.

##### 96  When person with an interest in the whole may retain accession

     * A person, other than the grantor, who has an interest in the whole of goods that under this Act is subordinate to a security interest in an accession, may retain the accession if:

      * (a) the obligation to the secured party with a security interest that has priority over all other security interests in the accession is performed; or

      * (b) the secured party mentioned in paragraph (a) is paid the value of the accession at the time of payment, if the accession were to be removed from the goods.

##### 97  Court order about removal of accession

     * A court may, on the application of a person entitled to receive a notice under section 95 (notice of removal of an accession), make an order:

      * (a) postponing the removal of the accession; or

      * (b) determining the amount payable to the secured party under section 96 for the retention of the accession.

         * Note: For which courts have jurisdiction, and for transfers between courts, see Part 6.2.

### Part 3.4--Processed or commingled goods

##### 98  Guide to this Part

     * This Part deals with security interests in goods that become an unidentifiable part of a larger product or mass.

     * A security interest in the original goods continues in the product or mass. The Part sets out perfection and priority rules that apply in this situation.

##### 99  Continuation of security interests in goods that become processed or commingled

     * (1) A security interest in goods that subsequently become part of a product or mass continues in the product or mass if the goods are so manufactured, processed, assembled or commingled that their identity is lost in the product or mass.

         * Note: A person might take an interest in the product or mass free of the security interest because of the operation of another provision of this Act.

     * (2) Without limiting subsection (1), the identity of goods that are manufactured, processed, assembled or commingled is lost in a product or mass if it is not commercially practical to restore the goods to their original state.

##### 100  Perfection of security interest in goods that become processed or commingled applies to product or mass

     * For the purposes of section 55 (default priority rules), perfection of a security interest in goods that subsequently become part of a product or mass is to be treated as perfection of the security interest in the product or the mass.

##### 101  Limit on value of priority of goods that become part of processed or commingled goods

     * Any priority that a security interest continuing in the product or mass has over another security interest in the product or mass is limited to the value of the goods on the day on which they became part of the product or mass.

##### 102  Priority where more than one security interest continues in processed or commingled goods

     * (1) A perfected security interest continuing in a product or mass has priority over an unperfected security interest continuing in the same product or mass.

     * (2) If more than one perfected security interest continues in the same product or mass, each perfected security interest is entitled to share in the product or mass according to the ratio that the obligation secured by the perfected security interest bears to the sum of the obligations secured by all perfected security interests in the same product or mass.

     * (3) If more than one unperfected security interest continues in the same product or mass, each unperfected security interest is entitled to share in the product or mass according to the ratio that the obligation secured by the unperfected security interest bears to the sum of the obligations secured by all unperfected security interests in the same product or mass.

     * (4) For the purposes of this section, the obligation secured by a security interest does not exceed the value of the goods on the day on which the goods became part of the product or mass.

##### 103  Priority of purchase money security interest in processed or commingled goods

     * Despite section 102, a perfected purchase money security interest in goods that continues in the product or mass has priority over:

      * (a) a nonpurchase money security interest in the goods that continues in the product or mass; and

      * (b) a nonpurchase money security interest in the product or mass given by the same grantor.

### Part 3.5--Intellectual property

##### 104  Guide to this Part

     * This Part includes some rules with a particular application to security interests in intellectual property and intellectual property licences.

     * If the exercise of rights by a secured party in relation to goods necessarily involves the exercise of intellectual property rights covered by the security interest, this Act applies to the intellectual property rights in the same way as it applies to the goods.

     * The Part also deals with a transfer of intellectual property that is the subject of a licence (or sublicence) in which a security interest is granted. The security agreement binds the successors in title to the licensor or sublicensor.

##### 105  Implied references to intellectual property rights

     * Act applies to intellectual property rights etc. 

     * (1) This Act applies to intellectual property rights (including rights exercisable under an intellectual property licence), in relation to goods, in the same way as it applies to the goods, if:

      * (a) the exercise by a secured party of rights in relation to the goods arising under a security agreement necessarily involves an exercise of the intellectual property rights; and

      * (b) the payment or obligation secured by the security interest is (in addition) secured by a security interest that is attached to the intellectual property rights.

     * Description of goods taken to include a description of intellectual property rights

     * (2) For the purposes of this Act, if a registration perfects the security interest in goods mentioned in subsection (1), the following descriptions are taken to include a description of the intellectual property rights concerned, or of an intellectual property licence required to exercise those rights:

      * (a) a description of the goods in the security agreement;

      * (b) the registered description of the goods;

      * (c) a description of the goods included in a notice under this Act.

     * (3) Subsection (2) applies subject to a contrary intention in the security agreement, registration or notice.

##### 106  Intellectual property licences and transfers of intellectual property

     * (1) If:

      * (a) a security interest is granted in an intellectual property licence; and

      * (b) the intellectual property in which the licence is granted is later transferred; and

      * (c) the licensee of the intellectual property licence continues to hold the licence after the transfer;

     * the security agreement that provides for the security interest binds every successor in title to the licensor of the intellectual property licence to the same extent as the security agreement was binding on the licensor.

     * (2) If:

      * (a) a security interest is granted in a sublicence granted under an intellectual property licence; and

      * (b) the intellectual property licence under which the sublicence is granted is later transferred; and

      * (c) the licensee of the sublicence continues to hold the sublicence after the transfer;

     * the security agreement that provides for the security interest binds every successor in title to the licensor of the sublicence to the same extent as the security agreement was binding on the licensor.

## Chapter 4--Enforcement of security interests

### Part 4.1--Guide to this Chapter

##### 107  Guide to this Chapter

     * This Chapter deals with how to enforce a security interest in personal property. Parties can contract out of some of the provisions of this Chapter.

     * Security interests in liquid assets can be enforced by giving a notice to the person who owes an amount to the grantor. Other kinds of assets can be seized and disposed of under Part 4.3. A secured party can also retain or purchase the collateral.

     * Proceeds arising from the disposal of collateral must be distributed in accordance with Part 4.4. That Part also contains other rules of general application in relation to the enforcement of security interests.

### Part 4.2--General rules

##### 108  Guide to this Part

     * This Part provides general rules about the rights and remedies available to a party to a security agreement for enforcing a security interest in personal property. The Part does not apply to certain kinds of security interests.

     * Important rules include the following: 

         * (a) a general standard of honesty and commercial reasonableness is to apply to enforcement actions;

         * (b) parties can contract out of specified provisions of this Chapter;

         * (c) if the same obligation is secured by both personal property and an interest in land, a secured party may decide to enforce the personal property interest in the same way as the interest in the land would be enforced, or to enforce the security interest under this Chapter;

         * (d) rules for the enforcement of security interests in certain liquid assets (accounts, chattel paper and negotiable instruments) by giving notice to specified persons or seizing proceeds;

         * (e) rules relating to the enforcement of security interests in crops and livestock.

      * (a) a transfer of an account or chattel paper that does not secure payment or performance of an obligation;

      * (b) a security interest that is incidental to a security interest referred to in paragraph (a);

      * (c) a PPS lease that does not secure payment or performance of an obligation;

      * (d) a commercial consignment that does not secure payment or performance of an obligation.

     * (2) This Chapter does not apply to security interests in goods that are located outside Australia.

     * Security interests in investment instruments or intermediated securities that are perfected by possession or control

     * (3) This Chapter (apart from sections 110, 111, 113 and 140) does not apply in relation to a person who has perfected a security interest in:

      * (a) an investment instrument by taking possession or control of the instrument; or

      * (b) an intermediated security by taking control of the intermediated security.

     * (4) To avoid doubt, subsection (3) applies whether the person has perfected the security interest only by possession or control, or by another method as well.

     * Sections that do not apply to household property

     * (5) The following provisions do not apply in relation to collateral that is used by a grantor predominantly for personal, domestic or household purposes:

      * (a) sections 117 and 118 (relationship with land laws);

      * (b) section 120 (enforcement of security interests in liquid assets);

      * (ba) section 126 (apparent possession of collateral);

      * (c) paragraphs 128(2)(b) and (c) (disposal of collateral by lease or licence);

      * (d) section 129 (disposal by purchase);

      * (e) section 134 (retention of collateral).

##### 110  Rights and remedies

      * (a) the debtor;

      * (b) the grantor;

      * (a) honestly; and

      * (b) in a commercially reasonable manner.

     * (2) A person does not act dishonestly merely because the person acts with actual knowledge of the interest of some other person.

##### 112  Rights and remedies under this Chapter

     * (1) In exercising rights and remedies provided by this Chapter, a secured party may deal with collateral only to the same extent as the grantor would be entitled to so deal with the collateral.

     * (2) However, subsection (1) does not apply:

      * (a) if the secured party had title to the collateral immediately before starting to exercise any right or remedy provided by this Part; or

      * (b) to the extent that it would otherwise prevent the secured party from dealing with the collateral by way of transfer because a transfer by the grantor would be prohibited or declared to be a default under a security agreement.

          * Note: See section 79 (transfer of collateral despite prohibition in security agreement).

     * (3) Without limiting subsection (1), under this Chapter a secured party may only seize, purchase or dispose of a licence subject to:

      * (a) the terms and conditions of the licence; and

      * (b) any applicable law of the Commonwealth, a State or a Territory.

##### 113  Recovering judgment or issuing execution does not extinguish a security interest in collateral

     * The fact that a secured party has recovered judgment, or issued execution, against a grantor in relation to collateral does not extinguish the security interest in the collateral.

##### 114  Rights and remedies under this Chapter are cumulative

     * The rights and remedies provided by this Chapter are cumulative.

##### 115  Contracting out of enforcement provisions

     * Collateral not used predominantly for personal, domestic or household purposes

     * (1) The parties to a security agreement that provides for a security interest in collateral that is not used predominantly for personal, domestic or household purposes may contract out of the following provisions in relation to the collateral (to the extent, if any, mentioned):

      * (a) section 95 (notice of removal of accession), to the extent that it requires the secured party to give a notice to the grantor;

      * (b) section 96 (when a person with an interest in the whole may retain an accession);

      * (c) section 117 (obligations secured by interests in personal property and land);

      * (d) section 118 (enforcing security interests in accordance with land law decisions), to the extent that it allows a secured party to give a notice to the grantor;

      * (e) section 120 (enforcement of liquid assets);

      * (f) subsection 121(4) (enforcement of liquid assets--notice to grantor);

      * (g) section 123 (right to seize collateral);

      * (h) section 125 (obligation to dispose of or retain collateral);

      * (i) section 126 (apparent possession);

      * (j) section 128 (secured party may dispose of collateral);

      * (k) section 129 (disposal by purchase);

      * (l) section 130 (notice of disposal), to the extent that it requires the secured party to give a notice to the grantor;

      * (m) paragraph 132(3)(d) (contents of statement of account after disposal);

      * (n) subsection 132(4) (statement of account if no disposal);

      * (o) subsection 134(1) (retention of collateral);

      * (p) section 135 (notice of retention);

      * (pa) Division 6 of Part 4.3 (seizure and disposal or retention of crops and livestock), or any particular provision of that Division;

      * (q) section 142 (redemption of collateral);

      * (r) section 143 (reinstatement of security agreement).

     * (2) However, if parties to a security agreement contract out of a provision, the provision continues to the extent that it gives rights to, and imposes obligations in relation to, persons who are not parties to the security agreement.

         * Example: Parties to a security agreement contract out of the right to seize property under section 123. A secured party who is not a party to the security agreement may seize the property under section 123.

     * (3) Despite subsection (2), if parties to a security agreement contract out of section 142 (redemption of collateral), the provision does not give any person (whether or not the person is a party to the agreement) a right to redeem collateral under section 142.

     * Contracts between persons other than the grantor

     * (5) A person (including a secured party, but not including the grantor) who is entitled to receive a notice from a secured party under one or more provisions in this Chapter may contract with the secured party out of one or more of those provisions.

     * (6) 2 secured parties may contract out of the right of one of the secured parties to receive an amount under subsection 127(6) (payment of enforcing party's expenses) from the other secured party.

     * Contracting out in relation to controllers (other than receivers etc.)

     * (7) Subject to subsections (2), (3), (5) and (6), the parties to a security agreement may contract out of the application under subsection 116(2) of any provision of Part 4.3 (seizure and disposal or retention of collateral) in relation to property.

         * Note: Subsection 116(2) provides for the application of this Chapter while a person is a controller of the property other than a receiver, or a receiver and manager, of the property within the meaning of the _Corporations Act 2001_.

##### 116  Application while there is a receiver or another controller of property

     * (1) This Chapter does not apply in relation to property while a person is a controller of the property in either of the following capacities:

      * (a) receiver;

      * (b) receiver and manager.

         * Note: See Part 5.2 of the _Corporations Act 2001_ for the powers, functions and duties of receivers, and other controllers, of the property of corporations.

     * (2) This Chapter (except section 131) applies in relation to property while a person is a controller of the property in a capacity other than those mentioned in subsection (1) of this section.

         * Note 1: Section 131 requires a secured party disposing of collateral to obtain market value for the collateral. Section 420A of the _Corporations Act 2001_ similarly requires a controller exercising a power of sale to obtain market value for the property sold.

         * Note 2: Subsection 115(7) enables the parties to a security agreement to contract out of the application of Part 4.3 under subsection (2) of this section.

     * (3) Despite subsection (1), if a grantor of a security interest in property is an individual, this Chapter applies in relation to the security interest while a person is a receiver, or a receiver and manager, of the property.

     * (4) In this section, each of the following terms, in relation to property of a corporation, has the same meaning as in the _Corporations Act 2001_:

      * (a) controller;

      * (b) receiver;

      * (c) receiver and manager.

##### 117  Obligations secured by interests in personal property and land

     * Scope

     * (1) This section applies if:

      * (a) the same obligation is secured by:

       * (i) a security interest in personal property; and

       * (ii) an interest in land; and

      * (b) either:

       * (i) the secured party's security interest in the personal property has the highest priority; or

       * (ii) every other secured party with a security interest in the personal property that has a higher priority has agreed in writing to the secured party's making a decision under this section.

         * Note 1: This section does not apply in relation to collateral that is used predominantly for personal, domestic or household purposes (see subsection 109(5)).

         * Note 2: Also, this section does not apply in relation to a security interest in collateral to which consumer credit legislation applies (see section 119).

         * Note 3: The interest in land might be an interest to which this Act would otherwise not apply (see subsection 8(2)).

     * Decision by secured party

     * (2) The secured party may:

      * (a) make a decision to enforce the security interest in the personal property under this Chapter; or

      * (b) make a decision to enforce the security interest in the personal property in the same way as the interest in the land may be enforced under the land law.

     * (3) In making a decision under subsection (2), the secured party must act reasonably and only take into account the following matters:

      * (a) the respective values of the personal property and the land;

      * (b) whether there is any connection between, and the nature of any connection between, the personal property and the land;

      * (c) whether the land and the personal property are both located in the same State or Territory;

      * (d) such other matters as are relevant to the efficient enforcement of the security interest and the interest in the land.

     * Decision to enforce the security interest under this Chapter

     * (4) Enforcing the security interest in the personal property under this Chapter, in accordance with a decision under paragraph (2)(a), does not limit the secured party's rights, remedies and duties with respect to the land.

     * Meaning of **land law**

     * **	(5)	In this Act:

     * **_land law_**, in relation to an obligation mentioned in paragraph (1)(a), means those provisions of a law of a State or Territory, or of the general law, that relate to the enforcement of the interest in land that secures the obligation.

##### 118  Enforcing security interests in accordance with land law decisions

     * Scope

     * (1) This section applies if:

      * (a) a secured party makes a decision (under paragraph 117(2)(b)) to enforce the security interest in the personal property in the same way as the interest in the land may be enforced under the land law; and

      * (b) unless section 144 applies, the secured party gives a notice in accordance with subsection (2) to the following persons:

       * (i) the grantor;

       * (ii) a secured party with a security interest in the personal property that is perfected immediately before the decision under paragraph 117(2)(b) is made;

     * How security interest is to be enforced

     * (3) The secured party may enforce the security interest in the same way, with any necessary modification, as the interest in the land may be enforced under the land law.

     * (4) Subject to this section, and with any necessary modification, law in the same terms as that of the land law applies under this Act for the purposes of the enforcement of the security interest.

         * Example: The secured party has the same rights, remedies and duties in relation to the enforcement of the security interest in the personal property as the secured party has in relation to the enforcement of the interest in the land.

         * Note: The effect of this subsection is not to adopt the land law as such, but to apply law to the same effect as the land law (with any necessary modification, and subject to this section).

     * (5) The regulations may modify the law that applies by virtue of subsection (4) in order to facilitate its application to the enforcement of security interests in the personal property.

         * Note: For the meaning of **_modification_**, see section 10.

     * Additional law that applies

     * (6) Section 140 (distribution of proceeds), section 117 and this section apply to the enforcement of the security interest in the personal property. Otherwise, this Chapter does not apply to the enforcement of the security interest in the personal property.

     * (7) In addition:

      * (a) the decision of the secured party (the **_first secured party_**) under paragraph 117(2)(b) does not limit the rights of any other secured party (the **_other secured party_**) who has a security interest in the personal property (whether granted before or after the first secured party's security interest); and

      * (c) the other secured party may apply to a court for the conduct of a judicially supervised sale for the purposes of enforcing the first secured party's security interest under this section; and

     * (9) If such an agreement is in force, the power, duty or function may or must be exercised or performed accordingly.

     * (10) The Minister may make an agreement with the appropriate Minister of a State or Territory for the variation or revocation of an agreement made under this section in relation to the State.

     * (11) An agreement made under subsection (8) or (10) is not a legislative instrument.

     * This section does not affect land laws

       * (i) the licensor; or

       * (ii) the licensor's successor.

      * (a) a secured party has perfected a security interest in collateral by possession or control of the collateral; and

      * (b) the debtor is in default under the security agreement.

     * (2) A secured party may seize the collateral under section 123 by giving a notice to:

      * (a) the grantor; and

     * Scope

     * (1) This section applies if, at any time while collateral is seized by a secured party (the **_enforcing party_**) (whether under section 123 or otherwise) for the purposes of enforcement, another secured party (the **_higher priority party_**) has a security interest in the collateral that has a higher priority under this Act.

### Part 4.4--Rules applying after enforcement

##### 139  Guide to this Part

     * This Part contains rules about steps to be taken after a security interest in collateral has been enforced.

     * These rules deal with the following: 

         * (a) the order of distribution of personal property or its proceeds;

         * (b) the transfer of title to collateral;

         * (c) redemption of collateral, or the reinstatement of security agreements, before disposal;

         * (d) when certain enforcement notices are not required.

     * A person exercising or discharging rights, duties and obligations arising under this Part must act honestly and in a commercially reasonable manner (see section 111).

##### 140  Distribution of proceeds received by secured party

     * Scope

     * (1) This section applies if any amount, personal property or proceeds (within the ordinary meaning of that term) of collateral is received by or on behalf of a secured party as a result of enforcing a security interest in collateral (whether or not under section 120 or 128).

     * (1A) This section does not prevent the operation of another law of the Commonwealth, or a law of a State or Territory, to the extent that the law requires the amount, personal property or proceeds to be applied towards one or more obligations to persons that do not hold security interests (or any other interests) in the collateral before being applied towards any (or all) of the obligations mentioned in subsection (2).

         * Example: This section does not prevent the operation of section 561 of the _Corporations Act 2001_, which gives priority to the satisfaction of certain unsecured obligations over the claims of a secured party holding a circulating security interest in a debtor's property.

     * Order of application

     * (2) The amount, personal property or proceeds must be applied in the following order:

      * (a) obligations to persons holding interests (other than security interests) in the collateral that have a higher priority (whether under this Act or otherwise) than the interest of the secured party;

          * Note: The interests referred to in this paragraph might be interests to which this Act would otherwise not apply (see subsection 8(2)).

      * (b) reasonable expenses incurred in relation to the enforcement of security interests against the collateral, to the extent that the expenses are secured by the security interests;

          * Note: Reasonable expenses in relation to the enforcement of a security interest are taken to be secured by the security interest unless the parties agree otherwise (see subsection 18(5)).

      * (c) obligations to persons holding security interests in the collateral that have a higher priority (whether under this Act or otherwise) than the interest of the secured party;

      * (d) obligations to the secured party that are secured by the security interest in the collateral;

      * (e) obligations to persons holding interests or security interests in the collateral that have a lower priority (whether under this Act or otherwise) than the interest of the secured party;

      * (f) to the grantor.

         * Note: Sections 102 and 103 affect the operation of this section in relation to commingled property.

     * (3) An amount, personal property or proceeds must be applied against interests to which paragraph (2)(a), (c) or (e) applies in the order of their priority (whether under this Act or otherwise).

     * (4) This section applies in relation to a security interest in collateral even if a person takes the collateral free of the security interest under section 133.

     * (5) An amount paid, or personal property or proceeds applied, in accordance with subsection (2) discharges an obligation secured by an interest in the collateral to the extent of the amount paid or the value of the proceeds or property applied.

     * (6) To avoid doubt, any amount paid by the higher priority party to an enforcing party in accordance with section 127 is, for the purposes of this section, an expense incurred by the higher priority party in relation to the enforcement of the security interest in the collateral.

     * (7) A secured party is not liable to an action, suit or proceeding in relation to an application of proceeds in accordance with this section if:

      * (a) the secured party applied the proceeds honestly; and

      * (b) the secured party applied the proceeds in a commercially reasonable manner.

##### 141  Secured party may take steps to reflect transfer of title

     * A secured party who is entitled to dispose of, or retain, collateral under section 128 or 134 may take any steps necessary to reflect the transfer of title resulting from the disposal or retention that the person whose title to the collateral is extinguished because of the disposal or retention could take to reflect a transfer of title to the collateral.

##### 142  Entitled persons may redeem collateral

     * (1) At any time before a secured party disposes of collateral under section 128, any other person with a security interest in the collateral, or the grantor, may redeem the collateral:

      * (a) by paying the amounts required to discharge the obligations, or by performing the obligations, secured by security interests in the collateral; and

      * (b) by paying the amount of any expenses in relation to the enforcement of the security interest, the payment of which is secured by the security interest.

          * Note: Reasonable expenses in relation to the enforcement of a security interest are taken to be secured by a security interest unless the parties agree otherwise (see subsection 18(5)).

     * (2) However, a person must not redeem collateral under subsection (1) if the person agrees in writing after the default not to do so.

     * (3) The grantor's right to redeem the collateral has priority over any other person's right to redeem the collateral.

##### 143  Entitled persons may reinstate security agreement

     * (1) At any time before a secured party disposes of or retains collateral (whether or not under this Chapter), a person may reinstate the security agreement by:

      * (a) paying the following amounts:

       * (i) amounts in arrears (disregarding amounts in arrears as a result of an acceleration clause in the security agreement);

       * (ii) the amount of any expenses, in relation to the enforcement of the security interest, the payment of which is secured by the security interest; and

          * Note: Reasonable expenses in relation to the enforcement of a security interest are taken to be secured by a security interest unless the parties agree otherwise (see subsection 18(5)).

      * (b) remedying any other default as a result of which the secured party proposes to dispose of, or retain, the collateral.

     * (2) A security agreement may be reinstated only once during the period in which the security agreement is in force.

##### 144  When certain enforcement notices are not required

     * A secured party is not required to give a notice to a person under section 95, 118, 121, 130, 132 or 135, if:

      * (a) after having made reasonable attempts, the secured party has failed to locate the person; or

      * (b) for the grantor--after the debtor defaults, the grantor waives in writing the grantor's right to receive the notice; or

      * (c) for a person other than the grantor--the person (at any time) waives in writing the person's right to receive the notice; or

      * (d) in any case--on an ex parte application in relation to the person, a court is satisfied that a notice is not required for any other reason.

         * Note: For which courts have jurisdiction, and for transfers between courts, see Part 6.2.

         * Note 2: Access to nonregistered data held by third parties may be provided to persons accessing the register (see Part 5.5A).

### Part 5.3--Registration

##### 149  Guide to this Part

     * A person may apply to the Registrar to register a financing statement, or a financing change statement, with respect to a security interest or certain personal property.

     * A registration may perfect a security interest, which may give the secured party an advantage under this Act in enforcing the interest.

     * A person must not make an application with respect to a security interest unless the person believes on reasonable grounds that the security interest is, or will be, held by a person stated in the application to be a secured party.

     * This Part also deals with verification statements, which verify the registration of financing statements and financing change statements.

     * The Registrar is responsible for giving verification statements to secured parties, who must give notice of the statements to grantors.

     * Publication may be used as an alternative to giving verification statements.

##### 150  Registration--on application

     * (1) A person may apply to the Registrar to register a financing statement with respect to:

      * (a) a security interest; or

      * (b) personal property prescribed by regulations made for the purposes of paragraph 148(c).

     * (2) A person may apply to the Registrar to register a financing change statement to amend a registered financing statement.

     * (3) The Registrar must register the financing statement or financing change statement in accordance with the application, but only if:

      * (a) the application is in the approved form; and

      * (b) the fee (if any) determined under section 190 has been paid; and

      * (c) the Registrar is not satisfied that the application is:

       * (i) frivolous, vexatious or offensive, or contrary to the public interest; or

       * (ii) made in contravention of section 151 (belief about security interest); and

      * (d) the registration would not be prohibited by the regulations.

         * Note 1: Section 161 authorises the description of collateral by a registration before or after a security agreement is made covering the collateral, or a security interest has attached to the collateral.

         * Note 2: The Registrar must give a verification statement to each secured party after the registration of a financing statement or a financing change statement (see section 156).

         * Note 3: Application may be made to the Administrative Appeals Tribunal for review of certain decisions of the Registrar about registration (see section 191).

         * Note 4: The requirement to pay a fee is satisfied if an arrangement for its payment has been approved under subsection 190(4).

##### 151  Registration--belief about security interest

     * Requirements for collateral to secure obligation etc.

     * (1) A person must not apply to register a financing statement, or a financing change statement, that describes collateral, unless the person believes on reasonable grounds that the person described in the statement as the secured party is, or will become, a secured party in relation to the collateral (otherwise than by virtue of the registration itself).

       * Civil penalty: 

      * (a) for an individual--50 penalty units;

      * (b) for a body corporate--250 penalty units.

         * Note: See Part 6.3 (Civil penalty proceedings).

         * Example 1: A person applies to register a financing statement that describes collateral as "all present and afteracquired property" of the grantor described in the statement. It is sufficient to comply with this subsection if the applicant believes on reasonable grounds that the secured party described in the statement will take a security interest in a particular class of items of personal property held (or later acquired) by the grantor (see paragraph (b) of the definition of **_description_** in section 10).

         * Example 2: A person applies to register a financing statement that describes collateral as "fruit". It is sufficient to comply with this subsection if the applicant believes on reasonable grounds that the secured party described in the statement will take a security interest in apples (see paragraph (b) of the definition of **_description_** in section 10).

     * (2) If a financing statement, or a financing change statement, that describes collateral has been registered on the application of a person, the person must, within the period covered by subsection (3), apply to register a financing change statement to amend the registration to end its effect with respect to the collateral, if:

      * (a) the person described in the statement as the secured party has never, since the statement was registered, been a secured party in relation to the collateral (other than by virtue of the registration itself); and

      * (b) there are no reasonable grounds (or there are no longer any reasonable grounds) for the belief mentioned in subsection (1).

       * Civil penalty: 

      * (a) for an individual--50 penalty units;

      * (b) for a body corporate--250 penalty units.

         * Note: See Part 6.3 (Civil penalty proceedings).

     * (3) The period covered by this subsection is as soon as practicable, or 5 business days, whichever is earlier, after:

      * (a) if there never have been, since the statement was registered, reasonable grounds for the belief mentioned in subsection (1)--the day of the registration time, or the amendment time, for the financing statement or financing change statement; or

      * (b) if there are no longer any reasonable grounds for that belief--the day when there stopped being reasonable grounds for the belief.

         * Note: The period of 5 business days may be extended by a court under section 293.

     * (4) A person who wishes to establish that there were reasonable grounds for the belief mentioned in subsection (1) (at any particular time) bears an evidential burden in relation to the matter.

         * Note: For **_evidential burden_**, see section 10.

     * Damages for contravention of requirements

     * (5) For the purposes of section 271 (but without limiting that section):

      * (a) compliance with subsection (1) or (2) is taken to be an obligation imposed on a person who applies, or is required to apply, for the registration of a financing statement or a financing change statement; and

      * (b) any person with an interest in personal property described in the financing statement or financing change statement is taken to be a person to whom that obligation is owed; and

      * (c) a contravention of subsection (1) or (2) is taken to be a failure to discharge that obligation.

         * Note: Section 271 gives a right to recover damages for any loss or damage in relation to such a failure.

     * Registration unaffected by contravention

     * (6) However, if a person applies for a registration of a financing statement or a financing change statement in contravention of subsection (1), and the statement is registered accordingly, the contravention does not affect the validity or effectiveness of the registration.

     * Registrations with respect to security interests only

     * (7) This section only applies in relation to a registration with respect to a security interest.

##### 152  Registration--location of personal property and interested persons outside Australia

     * A financing statement, or a financing change statement, may be registered whether or not:

      * (a) the personal property to which the statement relates is located in Australia; or

      * (b) any person who owns or has rights in that property is located in Australia.

         * Note 1: For when personal property is located in Australia, see section 235. For when bodies corporate, bodies politic or individuals are located in Australia, see section 235.

     * (1) A financing statement with respect to a security interest (including such a financing statement as amended by the registration of a financing change statement) consists of data that complies with the following table:

     * (2) If a person applies to register a financing statement (or a financing change statement) that would otherwise result in the statement of an end time in a financing statement not complying with item 5 of the table in subsection (1), the financing statement is taken to provide for the relevant default time mentioned in that item as the stated end time.

     * (3) A statement of end time does not comply with item 5 of the table in subsection (1) if it states an end time earlier than the registration time or amendment time in relation to the financing statement or financing change statement that provided for that end time.

##### 154  Financing statements with respect to prescribed property

     * A financing statement with respect to personal property prescribed by regulations made for the purposes of paragraph 148(c) (including such a financing statement as amended by the registration of a financing change statement) consists of data that complies with the following table:

##### 155  Meanings of verification statement and registration event

     * In this Act: 

     * **_verification statement _**means a written statement in the approved form:

      * (a) verifying the registration of a financing statement or a financing change statement (each of which is a **_registration event_**) with respect to a security interest, other than a financing change statement registered under section 185 (removal of old data) or 186 (incorrectly removed data); and

      * (b) including other data (if any), including third party data (see section 176C), approved by the Registrar for that form in relation to the registration event, a secured party, a grantor, or collateral.

##### 156  Verification statements--Registrar to give to secured parties

     * (1) The Registrar must ensure that a verification statement in relation to a registration event is given to the following persons:

      * (a) a person registered as a secured party in the registration immediately before the time of the registration event;

      * (b) a person registered as a secured party in the registration immediately after the time of the registration event.

         * Note: This section does not apply in relation to a registration event if the Registrar publishes a verification statement in relation to the event under section 158.

     * (2) If a registration event involves the amendment of a registration to change an address (including an email address or a fax number) for the giving of notices to a secured party, the Registrar must ensure that the verification statement is given to the secured party at both the previously registered address and the address as changed.

     * (3) If a registration event involves the amendment of a registration to omit a secured party, the Registrar must ensure that the verification statement in relation to the event is given to the secured party at the previously registered address for the secured party.

##### 157  Verification statements--secured parties to give notice to grantors

     * Requirement to provide verification statement

     * (1) A person (the **_statement holder_**) who is, under section 156, given a verification statement in relation to a registration event concerning a registration, must ensure that a notice of the statement, in the approved form, is given to the following persons as soon as reasonably practicable after the time of the registration event:

      * (a) a person registered as a grantor in the registration immediately before the time of the registration event;

      * (b) a person registered as a grantor in the registration immediately after the time of the registration event.

         * Note: This section does not apply in relation to a registration event if the Registrar publishes a verification statement in relation to the event under section 158.

     * (2) Without limiting subsection (1), the approved form for notice of a verification statement:

      * (a) may authorise specified data in the verification statement not to be included in the notice; but

      * (b) must otherwise require the data in the verification statement to be included in the notice.

     * Exception--waiver by interested person of right to receive notice

     * (3) However, this section does not apply in relation to a person mentioned in paragraph (1)(a) or (b) if:

      * (a) the collateral to which the registration event relates is (immediately before or after the event) described in the registration as commercial property; and

      * (b) the person has, in writing, waived the right under this section to receive a notice in relation to registration events to which paragraph (a) applies.

     * Contravention of requirement

     * (4) If the statement holder contravenes a requirement under subsection (1) to ensure that a notice is given to an individual, the contravention constitutes an act or practice involving interference with the privacy of the individual for the purposes of section 13 of the _Privacy Act 1988_.

         * Note 1: These acts or practices may be the subject of complaints under section 36 of that Act.

         * Note 2: If a statement holder fails to discharge an obligation under this section, an action for damages may be available under section 271.

##### 158  Verification statements--publication as alternative

     * (1) The Registrar may publish, in a way prescribed by the regulations, a single verification statement in relation to a number of registration events if:

      * (b) the events affect a number of persons registered as secured parties (whether before or after the events); and

      * (b) the Registrar considers that it would be inconvenient for verification statements to be given to each registered (or formerly registered) secured party.

     * (2) Sections 156 and 157 do not apply in relation to a registration event if the Registrar publishes a verification statement in relation to the event under this section.

### Part 5.4--When a registration is effective

##### 159  Guide to this Part

     * This Part provides for the time at which a description of collateral is registered. The precise timing of a registration may be significant in determining the priority to be given to a security interest in the collateral (see section 55).

     * This Part also deals with when a registration is effective and registration defects that may cause it to become ineffective.

     * A registration is effective from the registration time until the earliest of: 

         * (a) the registered end time; or

         * (b) an amendment time; or

         * (c) the time when the registration stops being available for search in the register.

     * A registration is only ineffective because of a defect if there is a seriously misleading defect in data relating to the registration, or one of a number of particular defects set out in section 165 exists.

     * If a security interest in certain property becomes unperfected, the secured party may be obliged to take steps to end the effect of the registration.

##### 160  Registration time--general

     * (1) A description of collateral starts to be registered in a registration with respect to a security interest, in relation to a particular secured party, at the moment (the **_registration time_**) when the description becomes available for search in the register in relation to that secured party.

         * Note 1: A written search result is evidence of a registration and of the registration time (see section 174).

         * Note 2: A registration may stop being effective even if it is available for search in the register (for example, because of a defect--see section 164).

         * Note 3: If 2 or more registrations describe the same collateral in relation to the same secured party, there may be different registration times for the collateral in relation to each of the registrations.

     * (2) The **_amendment time _**for an amendment to a registration is the moment when the amended registration becomes available for search in the register.

##### 161  Registration time--security agreements and interests

     * Personal property may be described in a registration with respect to a security interest before or after: 

      * (a) a security agreement is made covering the property; or

      * (b) a security interest attaches to the property.

##### 162  Registration time--transfers

     * A financing statement, or a financing change statement, may be registered to reflect the transfer of a security interest, or of collateral, before or after the transfer.

##### 163  Effective registration

     * (1) A registration with respect to a security interest that describes particular collateral, in relation to a secured party, is effective with respect to that collateral from the registration time for the description of the collateral until the earliest of the following times:

      * (a) the end time (if any) registered for the collateral;

      * (b) if the registration is amended to omit the collateral description--the amendment time;

      * (c) the time when the description of the collateral in the registration stops being available for search in the register (by reference to that time) in respect of the secured party.

         * Note: For the registration time for collateral, see section 160.

     * (2) This section is subject to sections 164, 165 and 166 (defects in registration).

##### 164  Defects in registration--general rule

     * (1) A registration with respect to a security interest that describes particular collateral is ineffective because of a defect in the register if, and only if, there exists:

      * (a) a seriously misleading defect in any data relating to the registration, other than a defect of a kind prescribed by the regulations; or

      * (b) a defect mentioned in section 165.

     * (2) In order to establish that a defect is seriously misleading, it is not necessary to prove that any person was actually misled by it.

     * (3) A registration that describes particular collateral is not ineffective only because the registration is ineffective with respect to other collateral described in the registration.

##### 165  Defects in registration--particular defects

     * For the purposes of paragraph 164(1)(b), a defect in a registration that describes particular collateral exists at a particular time if any of the following circumstances exist:

      * (a) in a case in which the collateral is required by the regulations to be described by serial number in the register--no search of the register by reference to that time, and by reference only to the serial number of the collateral, is capable of disclosing the registration;

      * (b) in a case in which the collateral is not required by the regulations to be described by serial number in the register--no search of the register by reference to that time, and by reference only to the grantor's details (required to be included in the registered financing statement under section 153), is capable of disclosing the registration;

      * (c) if the registered financing statement (as amended, if at all) indicates that a security interest in the collateral is a purchase money security interest (to any extent)--the security interest is not a purchase money security interest (to any extent) in the collateral;

      * (d) in any case--circumstances in relation to the data related to the registration that are prescribed by the regulations.

##### 166  Defects in registration--temporary effectiveness

     * Scope

     * (1) This section applies if:

      * (a) one of the following defects in a registration that describes particular collateral arises at a particular time (the **_defect time_**):

       * (i) a defect mentioned in paragraph 165(a) or (d);

       * (ii) a defect mentioned in paragraph 165(b), other than a defect resulting from a change of the grantor in relation to the collateral; and

      * (b) the defect does not arise only because of an irregularity, omission or error in a financing statement or a financing change statement.

         * Example: A defect mentioned in paragraph 165(a) may occur if there is a change in the serial number under which collateral is required to be described in the register. For example, a patent may be required to be described by serial number (a Patent Application Number or a Patent Number). The Patent Application Number may be changed to a Patent Number when the patent is registered on the patents register.

         * Note: A change of the grantor may occur if the collateral described in the registration is transferred. In this case, the secured party's security interest may be temporarily perfected for a certain period (see section 34).

     * Registration is temporarily unaffected by the defect

     * (2) Despite sections 164 and 165, the defect does not make the registration ineffective for the period starting at the defect time and ending at the earliest of the following times:

      * (a) the end time for the registration (as registered immediately before the defect time);

      * (b) the end of the month that is 60 months after the defect time;

      * (c) the end of 5 business days after the day the secured party acquires actual or constructive knowledge of the defect.

          * Note: The period mentioned in paragraph (c) may be extended by a court under section 293.

     * Registration becomes ineffective

     * (3) However, the registration becomes ineffective with respect to the collateral under sections 164 and 165 because of the defect immediately after the earliest time mentioned in subsection (2), unless, at or before that time, the registration is amended to correct the defect.

##### 167  Security interest in certain property becomes unperfected

     * Scope

     * (1) This section applies in relation to a registration with respect to a security interest if:

      * (a) collateral described in the registration is:

       * (i) used, or intended to be used, predominantly for personal, domestic or household purposes; or

       * (ii) registered with a serial number (see subsection (3)); and

      * (b) a security interest in the collateral that was perfected by the registration becomes unperfected at a particular time (the **_unperfection time_**); and

      * (c) the end time for the registration is a time more than 5 business days after the day the unperfection time occurs.

     * Requirement to end effective registration

     * (2) The secured party must, before the end of 5 business days after the day the unperfection time occurs, apply to register a financing change statement under section 150 amending the registration to end its effect.

         * Note 1: The period may be extended by a court under section 293.

         * Note 2: If the secured party fails to discharge the obligation under this section, an action for damages may be available under section 271.

     * When collateral is registered with a serial number

     * (3) For the purposes of this section, collateral is registered with a serial number at a particular time only if a search of the register by reference to that time and by reference only to the serial number of the collateral is capable of disclosing the registration.

##### 168  Maintenance fees

     * (1) The Registrar may give a secured party in respect of a registration with respect to a security interest a written notice requiring the secured party to pay the fee (determined under section 190) stated in the notice within 28 days after the notice is given in order to maintain the effectiveness of the registration.

     * (2) If the fee is not paid within 28 days after the notice is given, the Registrar may register a financing change statement amending the registration to end its effect.

         * Note 1: The Registrar must give a verification statement to each secured party after the registration of a financing change statement (see section 156).

         * Note 2: Application may be made to the Administrative Appeals Tribunal for review of certain decisions of the Registrar about registration (see section 191).

         * Note 3: The requirement to pay a fee is satisfied if an arrangement for its payment has been approved under subsection 190(4).

     * Division 4 is about enforceable undertakings relating to contraventions of civil penalty provisions.

     * The Registrar may accept a written undertaking for the payment of a specified amount to the Commonwealth within a specified period. The undertaking is given by a person who has taken action that contravenes a civil penalty provision.

##### 221  What is a civil penalty provision?

     * A subsection of this Act (or a section of this Act that is not divided into subsections) is a **_civil penalty provision_** if:

      * (a) the words "civil penalty" and one or more amounts in penalty units are set out at the foot of the subsection (or section); or

      * (b) another provision of this Act specifies that the subsection (or section) is a civil penalty provision.

     * (1) Within 6 years of a person (the **_wrongdoer_**) contravening a civil penalty provision, the Registrar may apply on behalf of the Commonwealth to the Federal Court for an order that the wrongdoer pay the Commonwealth a pecuniary penalty.

     * Court may order wrongdoer to pay pecuniary penalty

     * (2) If the Court is satisfied that the wrongdoer has contravened a civil penalty provision, and the Court is satisfied that the contravention is serious, the Court may order the wrongdoer to pay to the Commonwealth for each contravention the pecuniary penalty that the Court determines is appropriate (but not more than the relevant amount specified for the provision).

     * Determining amount of pecuniary penalty

     * (3) In determining the pecuniary penalty, the Court must have regard to all relevant matters, including:

     * Conduct contravening more than one civil penalty provision

     * (4) If conduct constitutes a contravention of 2 or more civil penalty provisions, proceedings may be instituted under this Act against a person in relation to the contravention of any one or more of those provisions.

#### Division 3--Civil penalty proceedings and criminal proceedings

##### 226  Civil proceedings after criminal proceedings

      * (b) the conduct alleged to constitute the offence is substantially the same as the conduct that was claimed to constitute the contravention.

     * However, this does not apply to a criminal proceeding in respect of the falsity of the evidence given by the individual in the proceedings for the pecuniary penalty order.

      * (a) an order directing the person to comply with that term of the undertaking;

     * The rules for determining the governing law in relation to a security interest differ depending on the type of interests.

     * For example, for a security interest in goods, the question of the governing law may be dependent on the location of the goods. However, for certain intangible property and financial property this will generally be determined by the location of the grantor.

##### 234  Scope of this Part

     * General rule

     * (1) In proceedings in an Australian court, the law of the jurisdiction specified by this Part in relation to a security interest governs the validity, perfection and effect of perfection or nonperfection of the security interest.

      * (c) chattel paper that is evidenced by an electronic record is **_located_** in the jurisdiction the law of which governs the chattel paper.

     * Location of a person

     * (3) A body corporate is **_located _**in the jurisdiction in which the body corporate is incorporated.

     * (4) A body politic is **_located _**in the jurisdiction of the body politic.

      * (b) a reference to the law of that jurisdiction is a reference to the law of that State or Territory, and to the law of the Commonwealth as it applies in that State or Territory.

     * Location within a foreign country that has a federal character

     * (7) For the purposes of this Act, in the application of this section in relation to a foreign country that is divided into territorial units that have their own rules of law about security interests (distinct from those that apply to the foreign country generally):

     * (2) The Registrar may only register a financing statement or a financing change statement (whether on application by a person or at the Registrar's initiative) at or after the registration commencement time.

         * Note: However, the Registrar may, before the registration commencement time, register a financing statement or a financing change statement under Division 6 (migrated security interests) or Division 7 (preparatory registration) of Part 9.4.

##### 316  Governing laws

     * Part 7.2 (Australian laws and those of other jurisdictions) applies only in relation to security interests in collateral (other than transitional security interests) that arise at or after the registration commencement time.

##### 317  Constitutional and nonconstitutional interests

     * (1) Section 251 (personal property taken free of security interest when Act starts to operate) applies only in relation to security interests in collateral (other than transitional security interests) that arise at or after the registration commencement time.

     * (2) Section 252 (priority between nonconstitutional security interests and constitutional security interests) applies only in relation to security interests in collateral, in relation to which this Act does not operate, that arise at or after the registration commencement time.

##### 318  References to charges and fixed and floating charges

     * Part 9.5 (charges and fixed and floating charges) applies only:

      * (a) in the case of a reference to a charge, a fixed charge or a floating charge in a law of the Commonwealth (whether the law is made before, at or after the registration commencement time)--in relation to a security interest (other than a transitional security interest) arising at or after the registration commencement time; or

      * (b) in the case of a reference to a charge, a fixed charge or a floating charge in a security agreement--in relation to a security agreement made at or after the registration commencement time.

### Part 9.4--Transitional application of this Act

#### Division 1--Introduction

##### 319  Guide to this Part

     * This Part deals with the transitional application of this Act.

     * This Part applies to transitional security interests, which are security interests provided for by security agreements (transitional security agreements) in force immediately before the registration commencement time. A transitional security interest may arise before, at or after the registration commencement time.

     * The registration commencement time is 1 February 2012 (the first day of the month that is 26 months after this Act was given the Royal Assent), or another time determined by the Minister.

     * Division 2 is about the attachment, perfection and priority of transitional security interests. Transitional security interests are declared to be perfected until the end of the month that is 24 months after the registration commencement time, or until they are earlier perfected by other means (for example, by registration).

     * Division 6 is about the migration of data about personal property from Commonwealth, State and Territory registers onto the Personal Property Securities Register. The Registrar may register migrated data about transitional security interests with effect from the registration commencement time. Such transitional security interests are known as migrated security interests.

     * Migrated security interests are perfected under Division 2 from immediately before the registration commencement time.

     * Division 7 provides for preparatory registration with respect to transitional security interests in anticipation of the commencement of the Personal Property Securities Register. Other data may also be registered under this Division before the registration commencement time.

     * Transitional security interests that are registered in this way are perfected under Division 2 from immediately before the registration commencement time.

     * Division 8 provides rules for dealing with defective registrations with respect to transitional security interests. For example, omissions arising from the migration of data onto the Personal Property Securities Register will not automatically render the registration of the data ineffective.

#### Division 2--Attachment, perfection and priority of transitional security interests

##### 320  Guide to priority rules for transitional security interests

     * (1) The following table is a guide to how this Act applies to the determination of priorities involving transitional security interests:

     * (2) Other priorities involving transitional security interests are dealt with under this Division as follows:

      * (a) for the priority between 2 perfected transitional security interests, see section 323;

      * (b) for the priority between 2 unperfected transitional security interests, see section 323;

      * (c) for the priority between 2 security interests, one or both of which is a transitional security interest, if the priority comes to be determined after the end of the month that is 24 months after the registration commencement time in circumstances involving insolvency or bankruptcy, see section 324.

     * (3) In this section, a reference to a perfected transitional security interest is taken to be a reference to a transitional security interest that has been continuously perfected, at the time the priority comes to be determined, since immediately before the registration commencement time.

##### 321  Attachment rule

     * For the purposes of subparagraph 21(1)(b)(i) and section 55, a transitional security interest in collateral is taken to have attached to the collateral immediately before the registration commencement time, whether the security interest arises before, at or after the registration commencement time.

         * Note 1: Subparagraph 21(1)(b)(i) provides that unless a security interest in collateral is perfected by force of this Act, the security interest must have attached to the collateral in order to be perfected.

         * Note 2: Section 55 provides for the default rules for determining priority between security interests in the same collateral. In some cases, these rules depend on when a security interest attaches. For example, the priority between 2 unperfected security interests is generally determined by their order of attachment (see subsection 55(2)).

         * However, 2 unperfected transitional security interests have the priority they would have had between themselves if this Act had not been enacted (see section 323).

         * Note 3: See section 320 for a general summary of priority rules as they affect transitional security interests.

##### 322  Perfection rule

     * Main rule

     * (1) A transitional security interest in collateral is perfected from immediately before the registration commencement time, whether the security interest arises before, at or after the registration commencement time (including a transitional security interest that arises after the end of the month that is 24 months after the registration commencement time).

         * Note 1: As a result of this subsection, the priority time for a transitional security interest under subsection 55(4) will be immediately before the registration commencement time, as long as the security interest remains continuously perfected.

         * Note 2: See section 320 for a general summary of priority rules as they affect transitional security interests.

     * (2) However, the transitional security interest stops being perfected under subsection (1) at the earliest of the following times:

      * (a) when the security interest is perfected by registration under Division 6 (migration of personal property interests);

      * (b) when the security interest is perfected by preparatory registration under Division 7;

      * (c) when a registration under Division 6 or 7 is amended so that the registration perfects the security interest;

      * (d) when the security interest is otherwise perfected by registration, or is perfected by possession or control;

      * (e) when the security interest is otherwise perfected (but not temporarily perfected) by this Act, other than under this section;

      * (f) the end of the month that is 24 months after the registration commencement time.

         * Note: In the case of a transitional security interest in collateral that does not arise until after the end of the month that is 24 months after the registration commencement time, this section has the same effect as for other transitional security interests. In particular:

          * (a) if a financing statement describing the collateral is registered before the end of that month, by the operation of sections 21, 55, 321 and this section, the security interest is continuously perfected from the registration time for the collateral until the registration stops being effective; and

          * (b) if the security interest is not perfected (otherwise than under this section) at the end of the month that is 24 months after the registration commencement time, the security interest will become unperfected at that time.

     * Exception

     * (3) Subsections (1) and (2) do not apply to a transitional security interest in collateral if the interest is of a class prescribed by regulations made for the purposes of this subsection.

##### 322A  Priority rule--priority between transitional security interest and security interest perfected by control

     * Despite subsection 57(1), a transitional security interest in collateral that has been continuously perfected since the registration commencement time has priority over a security interest in the same collateral (other than a transitional security interest) that is currently perfected by control.

         * Note 1: Only security interests in certain kinds of property can be perfected by control (see paragraph 21(2)(c) and Part 2.3).

         * Note 2: Subsection 57(1) provides generally for security interests currently perfected by control to have priority over other security interests.

##### 323  Priority rule--priority otherwise undetermined

     * If the priority between 2 transitional security interests is not otherwise able to be determined under this Act, they have the priority between themselves that they would have had under the law that applied to such priority immediately before the registration commencement time, and as if this Act had not been enacted.

         * Note: The priority between the following transitional security interests is not otherwise able to be determined under this Act:

          * (a) 2 unperfected transitional security interests (because of section 321, the order of attachment between these interests cannot be determined for the purposes of subsection 55(2));

          * (b) 2 transitional security interests that have been continuously perfected since immediately before the registration commencement time (because of sections 321 and 322, the order of the priority times for these interests cannot be determined for the purposes of subsection 55(4)).

##### 324  Priority rule--certain security interests upon insolvency or bankruptcy

     * (1) The priority between 2 security interests in the same collateral is to be determined under this Act, as if section 322 had not been enacted, if:

      * (a) the priority between the security interests comes to be determined after the end of the month that is 24 months after the registration commencement time; and

      * (b) either (or each) of the interests is a transitional security interest that has not been perfected, apart from under section 322; and

      * (c) the grantor or secured party in relation to either (or each) of the security interests is insolvent or bankrupt.

     * (2) Subsection (1) is in addition to, and does not derogate from, any other provision of this Division.

#### Division 6--Migration of personal property interests

##### 330  Scope of Division

     * This Division applies if, at or after the migration time, and before the registration commencement time:

      * (a) an officer or agency of the Commonwealth, a State or a Territory gives the Registrar data, in relation to personal property, that is held by the officer or agency in a register (a **_transitional register_**) maintained under a law of the Commonwealth, a State or a Territory; and

      * (b) the data is given in the approved form; and

      * (c) the Registrar accepts the data.

##### 331  Requirement for Commonwealth officers etc. to provide data

     * Upon a written request by the Registrar at or after the migration time, and before the registration commencement time, an officer of the Commonwealth, or the person in charge of an agency of the Commonwealth, must give the Registrar, in the approved form, data held by the officer or the agency in a transitional register.

##### 332  Meaning of migrated security interest

     * An interest in personal property is a **_migrated security interest_** in the personal property if all the following conditions are met in relation to the interest:

      * (a) it is a transitional security interest in the personal property;

          * Note: Transitional security interests are security interests that arise under security agreements made before the registration commencement time, to which this Act will apply at the registration commencement time (see sections 307, 308 and 310).

      * (b) data in a transitional register in relation to the property is:

       * (i) given to the Registrar as mentioned in section 330 or 331; and

       * (ii) accepted by the Registrar;

      * (c) a registration in that transitional register in relation to the property was effective immediately before the time the data was given to the Registrar;

      * (d) the registration in a transitional register was duly authorised by the law under which the register was maintained.

##### 333  Registration with respect to migrated data

     * Determination of registrable personal property

     * (1) At or after the migration time, and before the registration commencement time, the Registrar may, by legislative instrument, determine a class of personal property to be registrable if:

      * (a) data in a transitional register in relation to personal property of that class is given to the Registrar as mentioned in section 330 or 331; and

      * (b) registrations in that transitional register with respect to personal property of that class were effective immediately before the time the data was given to the Registrar.

     * Registration of determined personal property

     * (2) If, in the opinion of the Registrar, personal property is in a determined class, the Registrar may register a financing statement with respect to the property at or after the migration time, and before the registration commencement time.

         * Note: The Registrar must give a verification statement to each secured party after the registration of a financing statement (see section 156).

     * Matters to be included in registered data

     * (3) If, in the opinion of the Registrar, a financing statement under subsection (2) describes personal property that is the subject of a transitional security agreement, without limiting any other matters that may be included, the Registrar must, in the statement:

      * (a) either:

       * (i) if subsection (4) applies--state the transitional registration end time as the end time for the effective registration in respect of the personal property; or

       * (ii) if subsection (4) does not apply--not state an end time for the effective registration in respect of the personal property; and

      * (b) disclose that:

       * (i) the personal property is covered by a transitional security agreement; and

       * (ii) the transitional security agreement provides for a security interest that is a migrated security interest.

     * (4) This subsection applies if, in the Registrar's opinion, the registration of the interest in the personal property in the transitional register would have ended at a particular time (the **_transitional registration end time_**) in accordance with the law under which the transitional register was maintained (as in force immediately before the migration time).

     * Registration time

     * (5) The **_registration time _**for the personal property is the registration commencement time.

         * Note: However, the migrated security interest in the personal property is perfected from immediately before the registration commencement time (see section 322).

##### 334  Incorrectly registered migrated data

     * Incorrectly registered data taken never to have been registered

     * (1) If data is registered with respect to personal property in a financing statement under subsection 333(2) on the basis that the property is in a class determined under subsection 333(1), but the personal property is not, in fact, in the determined class, this Act applies as if the data is not, and never has been, included in the register.

     * Removal of data

     * (2) Before a time determined under subsection (3), the Registrar may (at his or her initiative) register a financing change statement to remove data from the register, if the Registrar becomes satisfied that subsection (1) applies to the data.

     * (3) The Registrar may, by legislative instrument, determine a time for the purposes of subsection (2).

         * Note 1: Incorrectly removed data may be restored under section 186.

         * Note 2: Application may be made to the Administrative Appeals Tribunal for review of the Registrar's decision under subsection (2) (see section 191).

##### 335  No requirement for notice of verification statement

     * Section 157 does not apply in relation to a verification statement that relates to a registration event consisting of the registration of a financing statement under section 333 or a financing change statement under section 334.

         * Note: Section 157 requires the holder of a verification statement to ensure that notice of the verification statement is given to certain persons.

#### Division 7--Preparatory registration relating to transitional security interests

##### 336  Preparatory registration--transitional security interests

     * Application for preparatory registration

     * (1) At or after the migration time, and before the registration commencement time, a person may apply to the Registrar, in the approved form, for the registration of any of the following:

      * (a) a financing statement that describes collateral with respect to a transitional security interest;

      * (b) a financing statement with respect to personal property prescribed by regulations made for the purposes of paragraph 148(c);

      * (c) a financing change statement to amend a financing statement mentioned in paragraph (a) or (b) that is registered under this section.

     * (2) The Registrar may accept an application made under subsection (1), but only if:

      * (a) in the case of a financing statement, or a financing change statement, with respect to a transitional security interest--the Registrar is satisfied on reasonable grounds that a transitional security interest will (whether before, at or after the registration commencement time) be:

       * (i) attached to the collateral; and

       * (ii) held by the applicant; and

      * (b) in any case--in the Registrar's opinion, it is operationally practicable for the Registrar to register the financing statement, or financing change statement, before the registration commencement time.

     * Registration

     * (3) If the Registrar accepts the application for registration, the Registrar may register the financing statement (or financing change statement), in accordance with the application, before the registration commencement time.

         * Note: The Registrar must give a verification statement to a secured party affected by the registration.

     * (4) A registration under this section with respect to a transitional security interest must disclose that the collateral is covered by a transitional security agreement.

     * (5) In the case of a registration with respect to a transitional security interest, the **_registration time _**for the collateral is the registration commencement time.

         * Note: However, a transitional security interest in the personal property arising under the agreement is perfected from immediately before the registration commencement time, no matter whether the security interest arises before, at or after that time (see section 322).

     * (6) Chapter 5 (registration) applies in relation to an application for registration under this section, and to such a registration, subject to this section.

#### Division 8--Transitional security interests: registration defects

##### 337  Registration effective despite certain defects

     * Scope

     * (1) This section applies if:

      * (a) a registration describes collateral covered by a transitional security agreement; and

      * (b) the transitional security agreement has given rise to a transitional security interest; and

      * (c) the registration would not, apart from this section, be effective in respect of the collateral because of a defect in the registered data (including the omission of data); and

      * (d) the Registrar has made a determination under subsection (2) in relation to defects of that type; and

      * (e) the determination applies to the registration.

         * Note: Sections 164 and 165 provide that serious or misleading defects in a registration, and certain particular types of defect, make a registration ineffective.

     * (2) For the purposes of paragraph (1)(d), the Registrar may, by legislative instrument, determine that registrations in a stated class are effective despite stated types of defect.

     * (3) A determination under subsection (2) may provide that the determination does not apply in relation to a stated type of defect unless the registration includes particular data in relation to the defect (or in substitution for omitted data).

     * Registration temporarily unaffected by the defect

     * (4) Despite sections 164 and 165, the defect does not make the registration ineffective for the period starting at the registration time for the collateral and ending at the following time:

      * (a) if the financing statement, as initially registered, states an end time--that end time (or an earlier end time, if the registration is amended to state an earlier end time);

      * (b) if the financing statement, as initially registered, does not state an end time--the end of the month that is 60 months after the registration commencement time (or an earlier end time, if the registration is amended to state an end time).

     * Registration becomes ineffective

     * (5) However, the registration becomes ineffective under section 164 because of the defect immediately after the end of the period mentioned in subsection (4), unless, at or before that time, the registration is amended to correct the defect.

##### 337A  Registration defective if collateral is not covered by transitional security agreement

     * Without limiting section 164 (defects in registration), a registration that discloses that collateral is covered by a transitional security agreement is ineffective to the extent that it describes collateral that is not covered by a transitional security agreement.

### Part 9.5--Charges and fixed and floating charges

##### 338  Guide to this Part

     * This Part contains special rules dealing with references to charges and fixed and floating charges in laws of the Commonwealth and in security agreements.

     * These rules are expected to have less relevance over time, as the scheme provided for by this Act provides an alternative to reliance on those techniques for security interest transactions.

##### 339  References to charges and fixed and floating charges

     * (1) This section applies in relation to a reference to a charge, a fixed charge, or a floating charge, over property in a law of the Commonwealth, or in a security agreement, but only to the extent that:

      * (a) the charge referred to has attached to personal property; and

      * (b) title to the personal property to which the charge has attached is in the grantor; and

      * (c) the charge is a security interest to which this Act applies.

     * (2) This section does not apply in relation to:

      * (a) paragraphs 12(2)(a) and (b), or subsection 19(4); or

      * (b) a reference to a charge, a fixed charge, or a floating charge, if the charge referred to is a perfected security interest that is provided for by a transfer of an account or chattel paper.

     * (3) A reference to a charge over property is taken to be a reference to a security interest that has attached to:

      * (a) a circulating asset; or

      * (b) personal property that is not a circulating asset.

     * (4) A reference to a fixed charge over property is taken to be a reference to a security interest that has attached to personal property that is not a circulating asset.

     * (5) A reference to a floating charge over property is taken to be a reference to a security interest that has attached to a circulating asset.

##### 340  Meaning of circulating asset

     * General definition

     * (1) For the purposes of this Act, if a grantor grants a security interest in personal property to a secured party, the personal property is a **_circulating asset _**if:

      * (a) the personal property is covered by subsection (5) (unless subsection (2) or (3) applies); or

      * (b) in any other case--the secured party has given the grantor express or implied authority for any transfer of the personal property to be made, in the ordinary course of the grantor's business, free of the security interest.

     * Exceptions

     * (2) Despite paragraph (1)(a), personal property covered by subsection (5) is not a **_circulating asset _**if:

      * (a) an effective registration with respect to the property, in relation to the grantor, discloses, in accordance with the regulations, that the secured party has control of the personal property; and

      * (b) the secured party has control of the personal property.

         * Note: For the meaning of **_control_** in this subsection, see section 341.

     * (3) Despite subsection (1), personal property covered by subsection (5) is not a **_circulating asset_** if:

      * (a) the personal property is goods; and

      * (b) the security interest is perfected by possession.

     * (4) For the purposes of paragraph (1)(b), personal property is not a **_circulating asset _**merely because the secured party has given express authority to transfer specific personal property, or a specific class of personal property, free of a security interest.

     * (4A) Despite subsection (1), if a grantor grants a security interest provided for by a transfer of an account or chattel paper, the account or chattel paper is not a **_circulating asset _**in relation to the security interest.

     * Current assets

     * (5) This subsection covers the following personal property:

      * (a) an account that arises from granting a right, or providing services, in the ordinary course of a business of granting rights or providing services of that kind (whether or not the account debtor is the person to whom the right is granted or the services are provided);

      * (b) an account that is the proceeds of inventory;

      * (c) an ADI account (other than a term deposit);

      * (d) currency;

      * (e) inventory;

      * (f) a negotiable instrument.

         * Example: An example of an account mentioned in paragraph (a) is an account that is a credit card receivable.

         * Note: For the meaning of **_inventory_** in this subsection, see section 341.

##### 341  Meaning of control and inventory

     * General rules

     * (1A) For the purposes of subsection 340(2), a secured party has **_control _**of personal property if:

      * (a) the secured party has control of the property within the ordinary meaning of the term "control"; or

      * (b) the secured party has control of the property within the meaning of Part 2.3 (possession and control of personal property); or

      * (c) in a case in which the personal property is inventory or an account--the secured party has control of the inventory or account because of:

       * (i) paragraph (a) or (b); or

       * (ii) subsection (1), (2), (3) or (4); or

      * (d) in a case in which the personal property is an ADI account--the secured party has control of the account because of paragraph (a) of this subsection or section 341A.

     * (1B) For the purposes of subsection 340(5) and this section:

      * (a) **_inventory_** has its ordinary meaning; and

      * (b) the definition of **_inventory_** in section 10 does not apply.

     * Control of inventory

     * (1) For the purposes of subsection 340(2), a secured party has **_control _**of inventory if:

      * (a) the secured party and the grantor have agreed in writing that the grantor:

       * (i) will specifically appropriate the inventory to the security interest; and

       * (ii) will not remove any specifically appropriated inventory without previously obtaining the specific and express authority of the secured party to do so; and

      * (b) the grantor's usual practice is to comply with the agreement.

     * Control of accounts

     * (2) For the purposes of subsection 340(2), a secured party has **_control_** of the following kinds of accounts (the **_relevant account_**) in the circumstances set out in subsections (3) and (4) of this section:

      * (a) an account mentioned in paragraph 340(5)(a);

      * (b) an account that is the proceeds of inventory.

     * (3) The secured party has **_control _**of the relevant account if:

      * (a) the secured party, and the person to whom the relevant account is owed, have agreed in writing that amounts paid in discharge of the relevant account must be deposited into a specified ADI account; and

      * (b) the usual practice is for such amounts to be so deposited; and

      * (c) the secured party controls the ADI account within the meaning of paragraph (1A)(d); and

      * (d) depositing any such amounts into the specified ADI account does not result in any person coming under a present liability to pay:

       * (i) the person to whom the relevant account is owed; or

       * (ii) if the person to whom the relevant account is owed is a body corporate--a related body corporate (within the meaning of the _Corporations Act 2001_).

     * (4) If the secured party is a transferee of the relevant account, the secured party has **_control _**of the relevant account if payment by the account debtor to the secured party would discharge the obligation of the account debtor under subsection 80(8) to the extent of the payment.

##### 341A  Control of an ADI account

     * (1) For the purposes of subsection 340(2), a secured party has **_control _**of an ADI account if:

      * (a) one or more of the following applies:

       * (i) the secured party is the ADI;

       * (ii) the secured party is able to direct disposition of the funds from the account without further consent by the grantor;

       * (iii) the secured party becomes the ADI's customer with respect to the account; and

      * (b) if the secured party is not the ADI--depositing an amount in the ADI account does not result in any person coming under a present liability to pay:

       * (i) the debtor; or

       * (ii) if the debtor is a body corporate--a related body corporate (within the meaning of the _Corporations Act 2001_).

         * Note: However, a security interest in an ADI account is only perfected by control if the secured party is the ADI (see sections 21 and 25).

     * (2) A secured party has **_control_** under subsection (1) even if the grantor retains the right to direct the disposition of funds from the account.

### Part 9.6--Review of operation of Act

##### 342  Guide to this Part

     * This Part provides for the review of the operation of the Act within 3 years after it starts to apply.

     * The Act starts to apply under Part 9.3 at the registration commencement time (26 months after the Act is given the Royal Assent, or another time determined by the Minister).
