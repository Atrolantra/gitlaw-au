    * (8) Part 5 contains additional civil penalty provisions to maintain the integrity of the PCEHR system.

    * (9) Parts 6 and 7 support the civil penalty provisions and provide for enforceable undertakings and injunctions.

##### 82  Multiple contraventions

    * (1) A Court may make a single civil penalty order against a person for multiple contraventions of a civil penalty provision if proceedings for the contraventions are founded on the same facts, or if the contraventions form, or are part of, a series of contraventions of the same or a similar character.

    * (1) Proceedings for a civil penalty order against a person for a contravention of a civil penalty provision are stayed if:

     * (a) criminal proceedings are commenced or have already been commenced against the person for an offence; and

     * (b) the offence is constituted by conduct that is the same, or substantially the same, as the conduct alleged to constitute the contravention.

##### 88  Criminal proceedings after civil proceedings

    * Criminal proceedings may be commenced against a person for conduct that is the same, or substantially the same, as conduct that would constitute a contravention of a civil penalty provision regardless of whether a civil penalty order has been made against the person in relation to the contravention.

##### 91  Mistake of fact

    * (1) A person is not liable to have a civil penalty order made against the person for a contravention of a civil penalty provision if:

     * (a) at or before the time of the conduct constituting the contravention, the person:

      * (i) considered whether or not facts existed; and

      * (ii) was under a mistaken but reasonable belief about those facts; and

     * (b) had those facts existed, the conduct would not have constituted a contravention of the civil penalty provision.

    * (2) For the purposes of subsection (1), a person may be regarded as having considered on an occasion (the **_present occasion_**) whether or not facts existed if:

     * (a) the person had considered, on a previous occasion, whether those facts existed in the circumstances surrounding the previous occasion; and

     * (b) the person honestly and reasonably believed that the circumstances surrounding the present occasion were the same, or substantially the same, as those surrounding the previous occasion.

    * (3) A person who wishes to rely on subsection (1) or (2) in proceedings for a civil penalty order bears an evidential burden in relation to that matter.

##### 92  State of mind

    * (1) In proceedings for a civil penalty order against a person for a contravention of a civil penalty provision (other than a contravention under subsection 90(1)), it is not necessary to prove:

     * (a) the person's intention; or

     * (b) the person's knowledge; or

     * (c) the person's recklessness; or

     * (d) the person's negligence; or

     * (e) any other state of mind of the person;

    * other than as expressly provided in the civil penalty provision concerned.

    * (2) An expression used in a civil penalty provision that expressly provides for a state of mind has the same meaning as in the _Criminal Code_.

    * (3) Subsection (1) of this section does not affect the operation of section 91 (mistake of fact).

##### 93  Civil penalty provisions contravened by employees, agents or officers

    * If an element of a civil penalty provision is done by an employee, agent or officer of a body corporate acting within the actual or apparent scope of his or her employment, or within his or her actual or apparent authority, the element must also be attributed to the body corporate.
