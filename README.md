# gitlaw-au

Ever wondered what it would look like if Australian Legislation was available in git / Github?

* [New Zealand has done it](https://github.com/wombleton/gitlaw-nz)
* [Germany has done it](http://bundestag.github.io/gesetze/)

gitlaw-au is my 2015 #govhack project

I didn't quite make it for GovHack.... oh well!

### Status

Text is extracted, but there's still some weird formatting and additional style info,
and still missing much of the structure (no table conversion is attempted)
